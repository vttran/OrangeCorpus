They expect customer to ship the defective product at customer's expense. Ridiculous!!!!Thank God I got square trade coverage, who are going to reimburse the shipping fees, or else i would have to suffer with this dirty product or pay $10-20 bucks to replace this one.",,,

82,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,1,1,9-May-11,AFOSWTSMYTPOT,Bad product,I bought this product about 2 months ago after reading the positive reviews on this site. It worked well for a month and then the problem started. Every few minutes it drops the connection and takes several minutes to reconnect again. I called the customer service several times and after changing the settings several times the problem did not get resolved. Netgear asked me send back the product for which I ended up spending $17 for no fault of mine. When the product is defective Netgear should make the returns free instead of trying to make money even on their defective products. I am waiting for my replacement and hope it will work.,,,

95,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,0,0,4-May-11,A27PRLY1N6KEND,Avoid at all costs!  Known defects!,"Like many out there, my Wireless G signal keeps dropping.  It's random but it happened 3 times today.  Stock firmware was horrible and the updates were even worse- sometimes causing more problems.  Replaced with DD-WRT, still no luck.  People say they've reported this to Netgear, who responded 'It's a known issue, just return the product'.  That's if within 60 days, otherwise Netgear won't talk to you- besides the sales pitch for their IT support program!I'm not sure why many have defects and many have no problems.  It may be that 25% are defects, and/or those that aren't having problems use the Wireless N signal only, which does work fine for me.  Plus they may not use advanced options that also have problems (port fwd/trig, virtual srvr, dynDNS, monitoring- some of these are not even available).  Bottom line is that Netgear has been promising fixes for 2 years... In the meantime, people faithfully waited, surpassing return periods. Even if they didn't, they already set up the router, etc. and are committed.  They'd rather wait for a fix than deal with return hassles.It's a win-win for Netgear: sell a defective product with a low return rate and increase memberships for their IT support program.  Do not buy and return if possible.  It is the effective and moral thing to do.  Netgear doesn't value their customers.Pro:- Wireless N signal works for meCon:- Wireless G signal drops constantly- Stock firmware and GUI are horrible- Customer support is poor, if available at all- Some advanced features are unavailable or problematic- No monitoring support- PriceyCustomers shouldn't think that dealing with all of these problems is normal.Yeah I miss my Linksys WRT54G too.",,,

102,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,0,0,29-Apr-11,A3SP9SP9QBE5W2,Very disappointed - look elsewhere,"Folks,I have had this router for 5 months.  I was hoping to take advantage of the latest gigabit speeds and the USB storage capabilities.  I have three major issues:1.  USB drive performance is terrible.  Also, requires a reboot every few days as the USB drive disappears from sight for no apparent reason.  My drive is a supported device.2.  The 2.5 ghz wireless speed fluctuates massively forcing you to reduce wireless access speed to get a solid and reliable connection.3.  The router blips out when pumping large amounts of data through it and disappears completely.  You can't ping it.  You have to reboot the router by pulling the power.I have unplugged this router and taken it out of my network.  I have reinstalled my old Zyxel X-550 as it gave me two years of excellent performance.  I can not recommend this router.As so much of the stuff we buy these days, this router is made in China.  Perhaps the quality isn't what we would expect from Netgear due to this being outsourced to a country not known for high quality.  That said, however... I think there is a lack of solid engineering here as the product just doesn't perform up to expectations.Thank you.",,,
105,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,0,0,26-Apr-11,A1UYO1JXXBYNLH,Waste of money...don't buy,Even Netgear support rep agreed that there is a bug in the firmware which makes the router drop connection with the internet (wired and wireless). I spent hours trying to figure out whether it is my ISP or Router and at the end bought Belkin N600 and have no issues of connection drops. I did not expect such a product from a company like Netgear. Probably this was my last netgear product.,,,
107,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,0,0,26-Apr-11,A2O75PPOMEJ4PA,Bad News,"I tried setting up this router but it refused to recognize my DCHP.  I then spent hours talking to both Netgear and my ISP.  Netgear told me I needed to contact my ISP and get them to bridge the modem to the router.  My ISP told me that was not going to happen.  I then tried to set up the router with an new modem and a different ISP and it still only recognized a static connection.  I returned the router and most likely never buy a Netgear router. I could understand if Netgear admitted that their router was defective, and this would have saved me a lot of time if Netgear would have pointed me in the right direction.",,,
112,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,0,0,24-Apr-11,A1EWHKGUPNUX1T,Piece of garbage,"Thing is a piece of junk.  After 1 month, the 2.4ghz radios started going out and dropping connection frequently.  You'd basically have to reset the thing.  Updated the firmware, and the issue persisted.Netgear's 'fix' was to run the router at it's minimum capabilities, cutting its speed and radio range below the default and pretty much hindering its performance to that of a $30 router.  I tried to get a replacement and they wanted me to send mine back AND CHARGE ME to do it.  Screw that.  I'm getting a different router and selling this one ASAP.DO NOT BUY.",,,
117,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,4,4,21-Apr-11,A5PLTYB1O0Q85,Don't buy! Several bugs on firmware will keep you upset!,"I started using WiFi technology 11 years ago and tried several standards and vendors of this technology, such as DLink, Belkin and Linksys, and always have decent coverage, throughput and features at a reasonable price. Since I entered into the HiDef world I've got a chance to Netgear due the specifications and feedbacks, as well as I assumed that a such priced equipment should perform as announced. But I was wrong. It don't give you decent coverage: my old Pre-N Belkin coveraged all my two story apartment and this one don't. It don't give you throughput: ten feet away and you can't have more than 75 Mbps for the 2.4GHz band and it is impossible to work with the 5GHz band if you far away than 30 feet. The upload and download through the file server is ridiculous and you can't have more than 1.5MBs of upload to the USB drive attached to it. It means that one of the supposed differentiator feature for this router doesn't work and you have terrible experience trying to backup things - it doesn't matter if through wireless or wired connection. Last but not least it don't give you the features it promisses and even a reset button doesn't exist on its management interface. The firmware is deffective and keep losing the 2.4GHz band and DNS forwarding and you have to reset it. Look into Netgear forums e see by yourself what I mean. Those issues are well known by Netgear but they can't issue a new and robust firmware, instead they keep change the name of the router. There are cheaper and better options in the market so keep away.",,,

BUY this router now.,"I bought this router on the recomendation of my business VOIP provider.  I was having some VOIP problems at work and they suggested I upgrade my router.  I have 10 networked computers and 10 phone lines.  I also bought this for my home.  I have 3 networked computers and Voip phone.I have had two weeks of problems with this router at the office.  Interestingly enough I have had 2 'firmware' upgrades that the router identified that it needed within this period of time, which I think is odd.  I had to call in a network tech to install it because when I tried it wouldn't work.  I am not a techie but I am not a novice at technology issues either.  I do feel comfortable with intermediate technology work.I had to hire another network tech to get it operational.  We are still experiencing connectivity problems and reduced internet speed. total coast at this point as been $850 and that doesn't include all the downtime which in my line of work would add about another $3000 to the current losses.As soon as I set it up at home my printer no longer worked.  As I am writing this i am talking with tech support.  I have been on the phone with three different departments, one of which wanted to charge me to get the thing operationalI have set up no less than 10 other routers, switches and modems in the last 5 years and have never had to call technical support or had this many problems.",,,
133,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,0,0,5-Apr-11,A1CETC0Y4AA5M8,God help you if anything goes wrong with it,"Worked great for three months, then all the wired ports died, and I entered Netgear support hell.  Call the 1-800 number, wait on hold for tech.  Get walked through 'troubleshooting'.  (Basic things like turn it on and off, see what IP address you get, try to ping things.)  Sure enough, it's broken.  Get told you have to call Amazon to exchange it under warranty.  Call Amazon.  They don't know what you're talking about; it's a manufacturer warranty.  Call Netgear back.  Wait on hold for a while.  Give the case number, ask for RMA. They claim to be transferring you, then hang up.  Call back.  Give them the case number.  Apparently they don't bother to record anything, because the new guy says he was to walk you through 'troubleshooting' as well before he can give you an RMA.  Go through the useless troubleshooting again.  Still broken.  Rep claims he'll transfer you to a supervisor.  Spend 15 minutes on hold, then they hang up you.  Call back.  Give case number to another rep.  She can't do anything unless you go through 'troubleshooting'.  Waste another 20 minutes.  Make the mistake of telling them you have a laptop as well, now we have to 'troubleshoot' with the laptop.  Yep, router doesn't work with it either.Have been on phone with one netgear rep or another for 2 solid hours now.  No end in sight.  At this point I'm ready to toss this router into the trash can and go buy anything but a Netgear.",,,

I called under the 90 day free support after purchase period. My router does not display the devices connected to it. It should display all of the wireless and wired devices such as computers and laptops connected to it.First I called and they told me that I did not have a Netgear router because my serial number was not in their database. They implied that Amazon had sold me a refurbished router and the only way I could get support was to pay for it. The person I spoke to was not a native english person and it was almost impossible to understand her. She flatly refused to send me to technical support since she could not find my serial number in her data base. I asked to speak to her supervisor and pretty much got the same answer but finally she admitted that they have a problem with their database and agreed to put me through to technical support. At this point I had been on the phone for 30 1/2 minutes.The L1 technical support person appeared to be from India and after 12 minutes  of talking and one question was what kind of modem do you have. I said that I will have to walk down downstairs to get the manufacturer's name. When I did that and told him the manufacturer, that's all he wanted to know. Didn't need the serial number or anything. So back upstairs to my PC before he said that he would have to talk to his L2 tech support person.He came back and told me that I needed to do a factory reset which deletes all of the password and security, everything in the router and reconfigure it. He also said that the next software upgrade would fix the problem. I said why should I have to reset the router and then have to fully reconfigure my network when they know it is a problem that is currently being worked on. No answer to that one except his L2 person told him that.Best I could tell he understood nothing about computers and was reading a script of questions. I don't think he ever really understood what my question was.Bottom line I like the router, it seems to work well except for the attached devices listing part but I would not recommend purchasing this router unless you are a computer professional who has a lot of patience.I did a Google search for their technical support and CustomerServicesScoreboard.com gives them a bottom of the barrel rating and I agree (304 out of 386). If you don't believe me Google for 'netgear technical service sucks' and see how many hits you get.Total time out of my life: Almost an hour! Good thing I wasn't paying by the minute.",,,
155,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,8,8,19-Mar-11,A3L6FR87VUKWYK,Watch out if you have WNDR3700v2,Purchased this and set it up. Very easy. Great product till I tried to setup Parental controls. I had to use their CD to set up Live Parental Controls. However it would not let me set this up stating Live Parental Controls were not supported by this router. Looked at their website and it states WNDR3700 supports it. Does not state WNDR3700v2 does not support it. It was only after placing a call to Tech Support that I find out this feature is not supported in their latest version that gets shipped. They asked me to go to the earlier version WNDR3700v1.The challenge is this:The version number is on the CD and not on the box. So you have to buy the product open it and then open the CD to find out what version you have. Thank goodness I bought it at Costco so I am returning it. Netgear does not know when they will have a fix for the Parental Controls for the latest version available. Now why does a company knowingly sell a product and advertise that the features are available when they do not even have a scheduled fix for the issues? Why bother with the customer aggravation and distaste left with the customer? This is beyond me.Having proper parental controls is very important to me with kids in the home. Only Live Parental Controls will let you do the combination of :1. Deny access to websites AND2. Restrict access to websites based on time of day (eg no Facebook when kids are supposed to be doing homework).So Netgear sorry but I have to return your product and hopefully next time you will not release a home use product without keeping in mind that parents amongst others buy home based products.Did not try any other features if they worked properly or not since it did not have the one most important feature I wanted - Parental controls.Otherwise this product seemed great in terms of the features it has (untested by me),,,

I've gone through 2 of these routers at Best Buy and Amazon, same thing. Even the new v2 has this problem. You don't know when it will crop up but when it does you'll know it.For that reason alone DO NOT BUY! Wait until they figure this out at Netgear. Or skip this product since its high in price for this kind of flaw. Check the forums at NETGEAR if you don't believe me. This is a 130$ paperweight.",,,

If you're going to buy this, buy two at a time.....

I repeat NOT going to do anything fancy like port forwarding or tiggering, and if this is the case you are way better off getting a router that is less than 100 bucks. I run a web server and it will block all incoming traffic after a while. If you are going to use this router to just surf the web then you are going to be OK with this unit. The firmware is sooo shotty that they already have like 4 or 5 different versions of it out, and the worst part is that non of them work properly anyway ( I downloaded all of them ).

Then we starting losing wireless signal, ocassionally, then we had none.  You can literally sit a laptop right next to this unit and the signal is unavailable.  Their tech support is a joke.  They outsoure their tech support for the first 90 days and after that they out-souce it again and want you to pay for their 'premium support' even though you went thru the e-mail support and have a claim # and an e-mail saying you have a defective unit that is still under warranty (they won't give you an RMA via e-mail you have to call) good luck getting to a person who can help you.

The WNDR3700 router constantly drops signal, cannot even give proper wifi speeds to anything (i.e ipad, iphone, xbox 360 etc...) it's very frustrating and extremely unusable.To be honest I'm surprised that there are so many people posting great reviews for this...I've tried to contact Netgear for help, but I had to leave a voice mail, after being put on hold for 30 mins???  Who does that?  I've never had happen to me, ever...also they've yet to return my call about the issue (3 weeks ago).  I tried the forums, next to no help there, besides 'power cycle modem and router'...Not really much to say about it besides that...I've switched back to my 5 year old linksys router...and it's still giving faster Wi-Fi speeds than the WNDR3700...very sad.  Also tried to do a firmware update, but router was already running latest firmware.  From what most other customers who've bought the item say on forums it's because of interference from other signals and such so I've also tried to switch channels and double check settings, but no help.Pros :+ easy installCons :- Terrible Wi-fi speeds- Constant signal drops*This review was meant to be short and to the point.",,,
205,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,4,4,12-Feb-11,AWDR50W44VTW9,Flawed Hardware,I have been a long time Netgear fan I started with my first one being the MR814 a wireless B router which was amazing for the time.Solid performance and great security features well before the other companies like mac address filtering.  The interface over the years has not really changed features added but by far the most easy to use and understand of the routers out there.That being said I had read reports that this router may have hardware issues in REV 1.  that was when it was originally called WNDR-3700.When I saw the name change to N600 I assumed this was the REV 2 that resolved some of the issues but it was up in the air as to whether or not it was still suspect.Well when this unit arrived labeled as N600 I quickly found out it was still REV 1.  Now I still dont know if REV 2 truly fixes the issue but here is what I tested and determined.Throughput of this device was atrocious on wireless and very suspect on wired.  With my old Netgear WNDR-3500 my Gig Nic Performance was great.  Id get a burst of 130 MB / a sec off my RAIDed archive server and it would settle down to about 70 MB/sec for the duration of the transfer.  This is honestly great performance which is what I expected but the new router WNDR-3700/n600 only started at 90 MB/sec and quickly dropped to the 40 MB/sec area and in some cases the transfers PAUSED then resumed.  This had me highly suspicious as to whether data would be getting corrupted.  I also bought an E3000 from linksys to test and saw that the perf on that was identical to my original router on the wired so it did point out an issue on the netgear n600.Now the BIG ISSUE was the wireless the highest through put I got off that wireless was 4 MB/sec.  Well my old router the 3500 was no great performer either similar in speed but I expected a high performance router to welll ..... perform better.At times I noticed transfers of only 500 KB / sec when doing sustained transfers on my local network.  This was completely unacceptable since I bought this strictly for my media center extenders since the 3500 had issues sustaining HD quality network traffic.  I then set up the E3000 for identical through put tests and was able to tweak that router to delivering 20 MB/s sustained over the 2.4GHZ wireless.  This was a huge differance in bandwidth.I am very upset about this because I didnt really want to go with linksys but the bandwidth of the n600 is a problem similar to all the reports on their forums and other sites.  I guess its a crap shoot if it works or not.I will say this if they can fix those Issues I ll buy one in a second as the WIRELESS signal strength was truly amazing it has to be the strongest router i have ever seen when it comes to signal.I already am prepared to give my e3000 away for when netgear gets their act together.Keep in mind this I flashed it with the most recent firmware and it still functioned the same.  I also used DD-WRT on it and the router performance stayed the same so this is completely hardware based.  I can see if you only use the router to surf the internet that you would think this is the most amazing router because the signal can literally penetrate two houses away but even then it at times hampered my 8 Mbit connection.,,,
213,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,0,0,6-Feb-11,A170HR0QF4F975,Does not work: Tech support can't make it work either,"I replaced a old (NEATGEAR) router with this product.  I could connect things up and get a wired connection.  I could not get anything in the house to see the router wirelessly.  I called there tech support and went through many settings all of which did not work.  My tech speaks english as a second laugange which made things go very slow (what?/what?/what?).  I personly feel the tech did not know much about the windows 7 operating system so I didn't think we even troubled shot if it was a network setting issue.  A long time later the tech advise me to return the router, which I will.  I put back my old router and yes virgina a get a wired connection but now nothing sees the wireless connection which worked before. So I will return this now and again later for a refund when no one can tell how to configure it and then go Ill go to BEST BUY and purchase it and then pay someone to connect it correctly.

I am no longer able to use the readyshare option (that stopped working after about a month) and I get constant error messages with regards to an internet connection, even though I am connected.  I tried updating the firmware from the Netgear website, hoping that would solve these issues, but I kept receiving error messages with that as well.  I called tech support, which provided no help whatsoever.  I was told that the firmware that was installed with initial setup is flawed and the additional 'support' that's been put out is also flawed, so it was removed from the company website.  I was told I would continue to receive the errors and not be able to fully use my product until the engineers at Netgear are able to put out a product that doesn't have these fundamental flaws, even though I was reporting additional problems that weren't listed on the support website.  When I pointed out that I paid for product features and services that I am not getting, and have not gotten for quite some time, I was told, in very poor, broken English, that Netgear only has to provide support for 90 days, and that essentially I was lucky I was even getting the information I was.  I have serious issue with a company that sells a product that does not function as indicated in the product specs.  I was also told by tech support that the engineers are 'well aware' of the problem and 'have been working on it.'  Considering the length of time these issues have been occurring, I have little confidence that a true resolution will ever be rolled out.  I will never buy Netgear in the future and rank their customer service as some of the worst.",,,

Next firmware update not expect until Q2 2011 according to the forum post above.  I didn't investigate much further than that.I think it's pathetic for a company to release firmware which has such an obvious flaw that end users are able to find it and post about it within 4 days of the firmware release, particularly when the problem IS THAT THE ROUTER DROPS THE NETWORK CONNECTION EVERY MINUTE.  I will not be purchasing any netgear products in the future, as their testing and QA are clearly sub par.Other than not being able to maintain a network connection, this network router worked great.UPDATE: 1/22/2011:  I decided to live without simultaneous dual-band, and got a DIR-655 which I operate at 2.4 ghz.

I purchased this router based on different reviews I've read on the internet.  My previous router was a DLink DIR-825.  I'm not a long worded person so here are the facts.Pros- This router is great to look at.  The styling is better than any other in the category.- It is easy for a novice to master.  The thing basically configures itself on first power up which is cool if you don't know what you're doing.- Web interface is also easy and concise.- Cables included appears to be high quality.Cons- Web interface is extremely slow.  Every time you make a small change to the router it takes forever to return to the main page.- DHCP Reservation doesn't work at all.  I commonly set up a DHCP reservation list.  It is often easier than setting all your devices up as static.  Problem is this router often has trouble releasing the device after you have set the reservation IP address and the device keeps grabbing the dynamic address it had.  Very annoying to cycle power on the router before it accepts the reservation list.- NO REMOTE REBOOT!!!!  WTF is that?  You can not reset this unit remotely.  Every single router I've owned for 10 years now has had a remote reboot.  Unbelievable!- It has a feature called 'attached devices'.  This is great if you want to see what computers are currently attached.  Problem is it is terribly unreliable which makes it useless.  Half the time it works and displays the computers that are connected properly the other half of the time it shows some of the computers and just displays &lt;unknown> as the computer name.  This makes it hard to reserve IP's if you don't know the computers named.- The 5Ghz has virtually no range!  I had a Netgear WNDA3100 USB WIFI stick which is Netgear's high end, high speed stick.  Wouldn't even connect to the router that has 10 feet away through one drywall wall!- The cost is VERY high for the limited 'advanced' features this router has.Conclusion?I had a netgear hardwired router about 8 years ago and swore I'd never own another netgear product.  Based on the reviews I thought I'd give them another chance.  WHAT A MISTAKE!!  If you don't know or care about any 'advanced' settings on a router and just want a standard DHCP for your home, I guess this would fit the bill but for the cost, it seems to me to be a rip off.  Netgear should be ashamed at this product!  The ONLY way I could stabilize this POS was to switch all devices to static IP.  This is a PITA for something that is supposed to be easy.",,,

All the while, the password is transmitted in the clear on the LAN. So, on the one hand they are so serious about security that the device doesn't trust that the person who logged on 4 seconds ago hasn't been pushed out of the chair by bad guys, but they completely trust the LAN so it's all a big joke anyway. A little balance would have gone a long way when designing this device.2) Forget anything you've heard about spread spectrum or frequency hopping.

Although Netgear recommends this product for 'Large homes' with 'multiple floors,' the cable that is required for connecting the PC to the router during the setup is all of 4ft long!  If the router is for a large home, couldn't the engineers at Netgear have surmised that the distance between the modem/router location and the PC might be more than 4ft, and have included a longer ethernet cable?!  Even in a 'small home,' this distance might exceed 4ft.  In a rather insulting way, the instructions assume that you are connecting a laptop to the router, and hence you should have no probelm bringing the PC to the router and using the dwarf-length ethernet cord ... but perhaps Netgear is aware that there is another category of PCs known as 'desktops' that are NOT easy to transport around a 'large home?'Moving on, the software on the CD runs extremely slowly and is geared towards Windows XP only.  Of course, Windows 7 has been out and about for months and months.  Surely Netgear could have made the minor effort of writing a CD setup for this not uncommon version of Windows?",,,

484,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,7,7,10-Jul-10,A18BGION3XIWKH,"Wireless dies when bandwidth exceeds 2.4MBPS, Lousy tech support","Let me start out this review with an old Latin proverb: Caveat emptor!I bought this router because it supplied the latest features for the least amount of money. I was wary of purchasing another Netgear product because I have not had the best of luck with the brand in the past (on three different occasions), however a majority of tech review websites and individuals alike gave it positive reviews and I decided to give the brand another shot.To that end, I very much regret my purchasing decision and I am extremely disappointed in this product. I will never buy another Netgear device for the rest of my days.Whenever total bandwidth on all wireless devices (all channels combined) exceeds 2.4 megabytes per second, the router resets itself. It just flat out dies and does a hard reboot. This will happen at sustained download speeds of 1.5 megabytes per second as well if you give it enough time. In fact, as I am writing this, I am downloading World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King, and it has died numerous times already - and I am obviously not very far into writing this review!I have tested this on three different computers: two desktops, one connected to the 2.4 ghz wireless N, another connected to the 5 ghz wireless N, and a laptop connected to the 2.4 ghz wireless N. The two desktops are currently connecting via a Linksys AE1000 dual band wireless N adapter, and the laptop is connected by a Gigabyte internal 2.4 ghz wireless N adapter. When any one of them or all of them combined are taking up 2.4MBPS in bandwidth, the router resets. As you can imagine, this is quite infuriating.Worse yet, when I called Netgear tech support they had me jump through hoops for two hours over two different sessions just to change the basic wireless settings and executing power cycles on both the router and the modem. They even told me to try plugging the router's power in to a different outlet! Keep in mind also, that this was all after I had gathered and shared with them the information I had about the mysterious cap to download speeds! How ridiculous! They ultimately told me that my hardware was faulty - a no-brainer if I ever heard one - and they would replace it free of cost, but I had to mail them my router first and wait for them to process and diagnose it and ship me another one, which would take up to 2 weeks. They did have an option to ship a router to me, but I would have to pay them $20 for express mailing it, and I had a one-week grace period from the date they ship it to me for me to get my broken one to them, or they would charge me the full MSRP of the unit! Completely ludicrous from a consumer's standpoint.Aside from these two issues, all the gigabit ports work completely fine, but the 5 ghz broadcast has terrible range - about half that of the 2.4 ghz broadcast. I have not tested the USB ReadyShare feature, but if it works as advertised, it should prove useful to individuals who share a lot of computers and files over a household, or would like a simple wireless backup option.So there's my review. Practically all negative. Shame on Netgear for putting out such a terrible product (and shame on me for giving them more of my money when they had failed me multiple times in the past). If I could return this product, I would, and I would get the Apple Airport Extreme instead. From everything I have heard it is the most reliable router on the market.",,,

They insisted it was my Norton firewall causing this problem.  when I asked if Netgear was incompatible with Norton, he asked me 'what do you think is causing the problem'.  After the 5th time he asked me that, I asked to speak to the supervisor, who was not rude, but no more helpful.  We shut off the firewall, and of course it still didn't work.  He was going to call me back within 2 hours, and that was 8 hours ago.  I do not expect to hear from them, and have wasted enough time on this router.  Fortunately there are other brands out there.

I got one in April and it worked wonderfully. It's jam packed with features like guest network, USB disk mount, N router on different channels, etc etc. I loved it. I've used Linksys, Belkin, and Dlink, and they all work ok but this is one of the best routers I've ever used. The menus are a bit awkward, but that's normal for a router that is jam packed with great features that I need.In fact, I loved my first WNDR3700 so much I got two more for my workplace. I got one from Amazon and another one from Fry's Electronics. I configured both to be identical configurations (except for SSID names, etc). Both had the same problem-- the b/g network SSID fail to pop up when I'm on AUTO channel mode. When I set it to channel 11, it would show up except trying to connect to it via WPA2 would not connect at all! To make matters worse, every time I try to change a wireless configuration, the router would halt 2 minutes, then shut off the wireless automatically for no particular reason! I would then have to turn the wireless back on manually. On my good WNDR3700, it would only wait 5 seconds and voila, it simply worked. Here's my question for you techies at Netgear-- why is it that the wireless for these two router turn off automatically after I configure anything on it? Why is it that WPA doesn't connect? Why does the g network disappear if I set to AUTO? Why does it take 2 minutes for each configuration change to occur? I don't have any of these problems on my first WNDR3700.I returned both of these junk and now I'm considering DLINK. FYI, at Fry's MOST of the WNDR3700 routers were returned routers, which says a lot about the quality of these routers. It's great that Netgear comes out with great products but if they don't have any quality control, their superb products are just junk.

The basic features of this router work very well and are easy to set up.  One of the key new features, support for a guest SSID, DOES NOT WORK.  And this has not worked on any of the Netgear WNDR routers they have sold since February.  And they have known this, since their own forum is the source.  (See [...])I am appalled that Netgear would knowingly sell a defective product, one where one of the key selling features did not work, to their customers.  And then make them figure this out, call their customer support line, and either have to live without this feature or return the router.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT TILL THEY FIX THIS ISSUE.",,,

Most of the useful features I need were there and I was able to set up things like static IP addresses fairly easily.Most changes to settings seem to take an eternity to take effect.  It's hard to believe that the router has a fast processor when the 200MHz processor in the Linksys is so much more responsive.Then the problems started.  I tried to turn on the guest network and both radios shut off.  I tried the button on the front of the router as well as the settings on the admin pages and couldn't get the radios to turn on until I shut off the guest network.  Netgear provided a beta firmware which solved this problem, but it didn't fix any of the other problems.I found that my new LG BD570 Blu-ray player could connect to the router, but couldn't auto assign an IP address.  Then I noticed that my old Palm T|X couldn't see the SSID nine times out of ten and was never able to connect no matter which combination of WPA settings I used.The combination of a slow and unattractive user interface, bugs and compatibility problems have forced me to return this router.",,,

An 'upgrade' was automatically found, and I accepted the suggestion to install it.  This was a mistake, as the 'upgrade' bricked the box unrecoverably.  After a long session with tech support, I finally was told that the firmware recovery utility on the CD is apparently not expected to ever work, and they asked me to return the unit for a refund, which I did and ordered a D-Link.I think it's truly pathetic that a manufacturer coudl design a product that's capable of bricking itself.  I know what I'm talking about, as engineering manager for a company that makes (not networking) products that have updatable firmware.  Not taking the precautions to check the file, have a fall-back position, etc., is just irresponsible.  Will avoid Netgear in the future.",,,

I had to go through talking to three or four  really novice support people before I finally got someone that gave me a firmware upgrade so that  the box would work.2)  There is no feature to test your email address.alerts and warnings, like there used to be on the other  two netgear routers I used to own.3) The wireless will not work unless you manually press the enable button on the front panel.  This  means that you have to be in pressing distance of that button any time you reboot, power off,  have a power failure, or in some cases even change your configuration, because I found under  several circumstances the wireless disables itself when changes are made to the configuration of  the box.4) The monitoring capability is the same as an over 10 year old router that I used to have.  This is  supposed to be state of the art, and all it can do is tell me what devices on my local net are  'connected' ... whatever that is supposed to mean ... 'connected' how.5) There is no software reboot as well.6) The configuration of the proxies and ports is about the same as the 10 year old router, but  the interface is more clumsy.There is so much about this product that is irritating, I am sure that I am leaving somethingsignificant out, but I am not going to spend all day on this review.I can tell you I would rather go to the dentist with no novacaine while having my leg amputatedthat deal with Netgear support.  What happened to Netgear's network products?  Where is theprogress, the innovation??The ReadyNAS Pioneer Pro is such an amazing piece of hardware that I cannot really believethat it was made by the same company, and it really was not.The design decisions in this router are two or three giant leaps backwards from whatNetgear already had.Find something else ... and if you cannot find anything better, at least find somethingcheaper.  Maybe Hawking Technologies, they are the up and coming hungry tech companythat is actually trying to make decent products.UPDATE ... after all the BS I had to go through, now I am getting a series of emails fromNetgear asking about my customer experience.  But I have to log in and create an accountin their webasite to be able to do that.  Why on Earth should I have to do that when theyhave my email address and sent me the link.  These people are idiots, and their uppermanagement will never figure out how bad their customer sat. ratings are because it isway too much trouble to leave any feedback.What happened to this company.  This thing should never have made it out the door.The router had been out for almost a year before I bought mine and still there was nota fix for the guest network, and not to mention again the daft design choices or notbeing able to reboot the the device or turn on the wireless without pressing a hardwarebutton.",,,

The Gigabit transfer speed from one computer (PC) to another (Mac) is blazing fast. It took about 4 seconds to move a 700mb movie from one computer to the other.THE BAD:The Modem/Router settings interface is terrible and looks totally out of date.

I tried connecting my Drobo to the USB port to turn it into a NAS. It wouldn't even show up in the router settings. I connected a regular HD via a USB dock and it could read that just fine. If you're a Drobo owner beware this setup probably won't work for you.My 3G (2nd gen) iPhone can't even see the network. Any of them. b/g/n doesn't matter. None of them even show up, even with SSID broadcasting and even when I tried to enter the network name manually. My iPad can see the '5G' network (their name for N), but it can't connect to it.

Unfortunately, it fell short in almost all aspects.First, when I installed the router, the automatic firmware installation indicated that there was a new firmware update, but that the system could not find the file specified.  I downloaded the firmware update from the Netgear website, but when I refreshed the configuration page, I got redirected to kb.netgear.com and could not get back to the configuration page until after refreshing my IP address!Next, when navigating through the configuration pages, I kept getting a message that stated 'The system cannot find the file specified'  I refreshed the page and got bounced to kb.netgear.com and was only able to get back to the configuration page by refreshing the IP address!After finally getting the firmware updated, I set up the wireless connections.  There is a wireless network for each band (2.4 and 5), which is not what I expected, but I could live with that if the range and speed were good.  Not so.  The 5GHz band barely showed up in my office, which had a decent signal with my old router.  The 2.4GHz signal showed up a bit better than the 5GHz signal did, but still not as good as my old one.  A huge disappointment.On the positive side, the gigabit Ethernet was fast, and when I was able to connect to the 5GHz signal, I did not have interference from the microwave.This was definitely not what I expected from a much newer device promising so many great features, and with so many great reviews.  With all the other routers out there with almost an equal number of positive and negative reviews, I'm going to take a wild guess that some routers work better in some houses than others.  Despite that, the setup frustration I experienced would be enough for the average user to stay clear of this router.",,,

After multiple calls, tech said probably a hardware problem. That's when I find out that it is Netgear's policy to charge for swapping the router. If I want to send it in and wait for a replacement,its free. If I want them to send me working router first, and then send back the defective unit, they charge $16.00! This is a first in my experience. In addition,their own community shows lots of postings about this weekly lock up problem (see : [...])All in all, not very happy to have to throw more money at a one month old router that is supposed to be Netgear's top of the line.Update: received replacement RMA router.

Now my 4 year-old D-link G router can do this simple thing but not this brand new top-of-the-line router! The only way around this is to configure sshd on two computers to listen to different ports. But to me this is purely unacceptable such a pricey router wouldn't do simple port translation.

721,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,23,31,25-Nov-09,A2HQX23UAYFADD,Average product - Below average customer service,"Overall, this is an average product. The main advantage (if you need it) is that is a simultaneous dual band router with the possibility of supporting guest network as well. Another functionality is the gigabyte router functionality and USB storage port (again, if you needed them).It is average in that regardless of band, the throughput and range is comparable to other cheaper products such as LinkSys 160N. In my experience the main disadvantage is throughput. When testing throughput between my laptop (with N adaptor and capable on operating in either band) and my desktop through the router, I get around 30Kbps. This is not acceptable for a N router where you should get effective throughput in excess of 100Kbps. This is further a concern when another router (around $100 cheaper) operates at around 60Kbps, i.e., twice as fast. As a background, I used a utility by lxChariot and the laptop was around 10 from the router with no obstacles.The reason I further reduced my evaluation from average (3 stars) is customer service. Specifically, each time I called, I was transferred twice. For some reason, the customer service number connects you to a customer service staff with very limited technical experience who then transfer you to another team. After explaining the problem and trying a few `standard' suggestions such as upgrading or flushing the firmware, I have been transferred to another level of support. At one time, after waiting for more 10-15 minutes, I was referred back to the person who referred me because the `higher' level support did not answer. While the staff was very polite in their interaction, a couple of incidences I find unacceptable, namely:1- The service rep. was trying to convince me that the throughput is the negotiated speed (in this case 300Kbps) which Windows reports for the network connection. I can only see to explanations, either the customer rep. is technically incompetent or he is deceptive.2- Another service rep. indicated that NetGear only consider Internet throughput. Again, this is utterly unacceptable as current speeds afforded by N or even G routers will exceed home Internet connections. I have repeatedly emphasized that a router is not just for connecting to the Internet but also for home networking (connecting computers)In summary, for average use that requires multiple networks (on different band), a gigabyte router, and/or network storage this router is for you (at a price). Otherwise, if you are interested in higher throughput, you are better off looking elsewhere. On a side note, I find using a utility to measure throughput instrumental to compare and evaluate router.",,,

847,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,2,2,6-Nov-13,A260SSASBXC090,I really wanted to like this router,"I thought this router had it all: dual band wifi, guest networks, gigabit ethernet, and a consumer-friendly price tag.  I've also heard good things about the Netgear brand.  However, after spending a couple hours configuring this router, all of my wifi devices connecting on the 2.4Ghz band would randomly lose their internet connection.  Devices on the 5Ghz band and devices connected directly to the router could still browse the internet, so it wasn't an issue with my cable modem.  I could still connect to local network resources (shared folders) on the 2.4Ghz band, so it wasn't an issue with wifi interference.  Maybe it was a DHCP issue?  Nope, performing a release and renew, and waiting 24 hours for the leases to expire, did not resolve the issue.  This issue had me puzzled.I attempted to contact support, but they were equally puzzled. After being told to completely wipe out my settings and start over a few different times, I decided that the time I could spend re-keying all of the settings would be better spent packing up this router to return it.  The model I had was WNDR3700 v4, which is the supposed version that corrected some of the issues in v1-3.  But, apparently, this version has its own issues.Yes, I did update the stock firmware to the latest version and, yes, I know what I'm doing (I've installed and securely configured many routers for family and friends without an issue).  How does a product like this get released to the market, by a name brand such as Netgear?  To give them the benefit of the doubt, it is possible that I just had a defective model, but after looking at the other 1-star reviews here and the issues on Netgear's own forums, I decided not to take another gamble with a replacement.  I'm sure Netgear does have some quality products, but the router I received was not one of them.",,,

Worked well for 8 months, then lost all range. 15 feet from router there is almost no signal. Called support, told that there is a one year warranty, but no phone support or live chat support for anything past 90 days. I asked how I could determine if it was bad without support, and they said they could do limited support, but 2 year support would be $190. They then asked if the power light was on, which it was. Then they pinged it and it replied. Then they asked if I could log on to the router which I could. They then told me that it was not a router problem and I would need to purchase the support. 2 routers in 8 months is not acceptable to me.

Since I have always had issues with cheaper and/or refurbished networking equipment, I decided to spend a good amount of money (just under a hundred dollars US) on a &#34;good&#34; modern router.  One with simultaneous dual-band, GigE, guest SSID, etc. and despite my past negative experiences with Netgear products, I decided to give this one a go.  And for the first several months, I was thrilled.But THEN:Out of the blue, one day the router just decided to reboot itself every hour or so.  Then every 45 minutes. Now it barely works for 15-20 minutes before rebooting.  Once it comes back up, everything works well until the next reboot.  But it really sucks when you're watching a movie on Netflix and have to keep taking 5 minute breaks as the connection drops out and re-establishes.I then tried dropping the stock firmware and slapping DD-WRT firmware on the router, but the build for my router (WNDR3700v3) has a bug in the wireless portion which caused the Wi-Fi to be completely unusable.  Spent a day or so getting the stock firmware loaded back on; the wireless returned but unfortunately so did the reboots.Apparently Netgear is only honoring 90 days out of the 12 month warranty stated on the box; I am not too optimistic about my chances of getting this problem resolved satisfactorily.  Probably gonna consider this hundred bucks to be a hard earned lesson...Netgear...NEVER AGAIN!!!",,,

We bought netgear when we got a new laptop a couple of weeks ago and having a lot of trouble connecting to it. We were told our wifi was old and probably needed to update, which was true enough but wish we had just updated to the same kind. We have had this since March 8th and even took back the new laptop because we thought there was something wrong with it, bought this with the laptop and still can't get on the internet with the new laptop half the time! It sometimes will connect for a few minutes or even a few hours then no connection at all! Right now there is none. I called netgear and the first guy kept asking what kind of virus protection I was using and telling me I just needed to get a better one, didn't try to help with the problem at all. The second guy got on my computer and said there was a lot of stuff that needed taken off that had the little yellow exclamation points and red warnings saying they sometimes come on your computer with some of the things they put on it. I barely have used the computer so if they are on there they must have come with what little stuff they put on computers these days. Of course he couldn't take them off because he said it was a software problem, well actually he could but it would cost me $250. That would also get me a new computer protection but even so it's a lot to pay to take something off of a computer that is a couple of weeks old and barely used. So he was no help either.

Worked perfectly for the first day. Onto the 2nd day, I'm on my computer, surfing the internet and out of no where I didn't have any connection. Looked at the router and noticed that it restarted by itself. I only have my computer, PS3 and phone connected to the WiFi. I tried to restart it by unplugging the router and the modem and waited around 1 min before plugging both back in. Waited for the router to start, and it restarted again. Checked all connections and everything fits perfectly, no loose connection. Mind you that I have updated the router as soon as I got it up and running when I got it (Firmware v1.0.1.42). I kept doing the unplugging for the next 30 mins and it finally started, but my WiFi was not turning on, only the Ethernet, after waiting 10 mins. So I had to unplug again and it started. Fast forward a few days later (Today 10/07/2013) It restarted again out of no where with the same device connected. I'm getting really tired of this.Never had any issue with the N300 but this router is a pain. Should have listed the reviews and went with another router. Will return this router if it restarts one more time. Too many restarts. If it does restarts, I will go with the Asus or Linksys AC router, since I hear a lot of good things about it and have a really really good reviews on Amazon and other sources.Hope Netgear read and understands the issue since other people are having really similar issues.Pros:Easy to set upExcellent featuresGets a steady and constant speedCons:Constant restartWiFi won't start sometimes.It may be a faulty unit, but If anyone else gets it, I hope you guys don't have any problems, or else is a pain.Thank you for reading my reviews, hope it was helpful in anyway.",,,

1117,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,4,5,2-Aug-13,A32SLU7XH90GR2,wish it would have worked longer and very poor tech support,"I purchased this router after a careful review of the specs which were very good indeed when I purchased the product.  This router worked like a charm for 9 months, flawless.  I have quite a few devices on the network, three laptops, couple of Xboxes, tablet, three smart phones, apple tv, you know the basics.  The dual band wifi was great, fast two signals secure really worked good.  Then, the wifi signal would just drop, like every ten minutes, you could reconnect by turning the wifi of and on again a couple of times and it would work for a while and then drop again, repeat, repeat etc.  I call the cable company and they run their diagnostics and point to the router.  I finally break down and call netgear which routes you to use an outside contractor which you pay for in order to get support.  This is frustrating but I liked the router.  I pay $40 to use their contracted tech support.  Over many hours (4) on multiple days they run me through all of the check lists and procedures, reset to factory settings, change channels, probably five other settings each requiring some time to see if the problem still exists.  They conclude it must be the ISP.  I have charter come out rerun wire, check signals, quite a bit actually with the same result.  The ISP portion works fine, always did but your router, not so much, same problem.  I call tech support again, pretty much the exact same solution run through the settings factory reset etc.  At this point there is nothing a setting will do to fix this issue. I ask for an RMA. It's still under 1 yr old, tech support says we don't do that, call netgear. I call netgear and get rerouted to tech support which says why did you call us?  So basically, there is no way to get to netgear directly to get an RMA because tech support will not issue you one.  So the warranty works how again? Did I mention I have already paid for tech support by the way.  So, if you want to roll the dice with this piece of equipment by all means.  However, if it's possible that you will either need tech support and  are not 100% sure this router will never fail I just can't recommend this product or this company and definitely not the tech support, as it was really time consuming, frustrating and useless.  It would have been far better to go out and purchase another product for $100 and skip the tech support and literally hours and hours of time wasted trying to get this product to work again or get someone on the phone to issue an RMA.  Which if that is the current business model of Netgear well that's really not terribly consumer friendly.So you do not get the wrong idea, this product the WNDR3700 was being used to replace the Netgear WNR2000 which still works flawlessly which is why I choose to stay with this brand for this product.

From previous experience with Netgear I know there was no point in calling them for support because they make you pay  a lot for for it.I wish I had bought a cheaper router instead of handing over close to $100 for this piece of junk that lasted for a few months. (I notice all the 5 star reviews are written by people who have just had the router a few weeks) Yeah,this router is super easy to set up, and works great.....for about 5 or 6 months.

I plugged it in and went to log in and that is where the problem started.  There was no graphical user interface.  Only a white screen with black text.  There was no banner or Netgear header.  There was no grey or blue or green or any other color other than black text on a white screen.  So I called tech support.  An hour and a half later and dozens of statements by the tech saying that this was the normal user interface, I went on youtube and saw what it was supposed to look like.  Mine was nothing like that.  It was as if I typed the text on a white sheet in MS Word.  The tech still insisted that was the way it was designed.  I can only assume that he was either incompetent or he likes to stubbornly insist on lying about the fact that my new router is defective.  NETGEAR must do a better job than this.  I can believe that the router is bad out of the box given the hit and miss reviews, but I can't accept the obstinate refusal to listen to the experience of the customer when there is obviously a problem.

I purchased this router (not from Amazon) to replace an old die-hard-set-it-and-forget-it Linksys WRT54G.  The Linksys worked great for years... the NETGEAR WNDR3700 I purchased slowly but surely crapped out on me after only 6 months... possibly a factory defect but nonetheless left a lasting bad impression.  The WiFi range was not what I expected of an N router and really not much better than my old Linksys.Although the router was set to broadcast 24/7, at the 5 month mark, the 2.4ghz band would randomly shut off once a day.  After a couple of weeks it went to twice a day.  I had to access the router through the 5ghz band to reset it or restart it from the on/off switch at the back of the router.  After the reset/restart the 2.4ghz band would work.  After a few weeks of frustrating daily restarts, the 2.4ghz band completely went out.  Restarts or resets no longer helped.Overall I am very disappointed with this router's hardware problems, performance and poor range.  I replaced the NETGEAR with an ASUS RT-N66U Wireless N900 I ordered through Amazon.  The web-based interface on the ASUS is clean and the wifi range beats the NETGEAR by a mile.  Where I got zero to one bar of signal strength on my iPhone 5 and Nexus 7 with the NETGEAR, I am now registering almost full bars.  My home network has two wireless FOSCAM cameras that did not stream well on the NETGEAR but now works perfectly connected to the ASUS RT-N66U.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ROUTER.  Move on to something better and it doesn't have to be the ASUS I purchased... but I do recommend it.  I hear the Cisco EA4200 or EA4500 work well too.",,,

It worked fine in the beginning, but suddenly the 2.4 GHz signal strength dropped so you had to be less than a foot from the router to connect to it.  I called customer service and after 3(!!!) hours on the phone, they agreed to send me a replacement (they initially wanted me to send mine in first or to pay for the shipment)- and I would be stuck with no internet (I could still use the 5GHz with my IPad).  The new router arrived a few weeks ago, but now it stopped working because of a different problem. I am now already 2.5 hours on the phone with them and still am not sure they will send me a new one without charging, even though they admit that they will need to do so.Bottom line - a faulty unreliable product, with terrible tech support and customer service.  I would highly recommend not to buy.",,,

There really wasn't anything wrong with the old router, but I hoped for a faster connection with the newer technology. Since installing it several months ago, the Netgear drops our internet connection at least once a week and more commonly every couple of days. It must be restarted to reestablish the connection. I never had this problem with the old Linksys router, which stayed connected for months at a time and never had to be restarted. Since purchasing the Netgear router, I've read many similar complaints from frustrated customers. I worked with Netgear tech support on two occasions and their level of understanding of the product seems very basic and their ability to help has been limited. No solution yet. I would recommend avoiding this product.",,,

The time between purchases is years. The combination of radios, USB ports, firmware, and other built-in services require a solid evening or two of research.I&#8217;m a network savvy developer and it took me 30 minutes just to set the SSID and passphrase. That&#8217;s not right. I should have noticed something was amiss when I saw the router&#8217;s ON/OFF button. My old D-Link has no such feature. Why should it? I want constant access to data when it&#8217;s available.The setup delays were caused by a modal pop-up on the router&#8217;s admin page: &#8220;WPS process is in progress, please apply the changes later.&#8221; The number one search on Google pointed to the Netgear support forum, which was down the entire day I tried to setup the network. Thank you, Google cache. The solution was to initiate a WPS connection then cancel it. Whatever. The wired LAN worked, wifi worked, and all my devices could connect. Setup isn&#8217;t too critical (or so I rationalized) because I configure it and leave it. A router isn&#8217;t something you interact with &#8211; it just moves data.Every morning and sometimes midday the router would simply hang. The use of the power switch became clear. Netgear couldn&#8217;t get the firmware to work so they tacked on a power switch for fast/effective resets.Set in the OFF position I&#8217;m still not entirely sure it&#8217;s not operating. I didn&#8217;t hook up a wattmeter. I&#8217;d rather not know, actually.

I called NETGEAR but they didn't help because my three month free support period was over. NETGEAR wanted me to pay a monthly fee of about $15(not a 100% on this number). I have already went back to my old router that I bought for $50. This is a first time I have ever bought a NETGEAR product and it feels like I have been conned out of a $100.

Network has been down more than it has been up, and after exhausting all trouble-shooting efforts, it is clear that it is the router.  Of course the return period has expired, and I'm left with an expensive paperweight.  It would sure be nice if Amazon would consider a replacement/return.  Honestly, all I want is a functioning router, an exchange would be suitable.  Well, I guess I'm back to using my 10+ year old router until I find another solution.",,,

These involve the date of manufacture of the router, the date of purchase of the router, and the time period that has elapsed since purchase.  Prior to purchase of the product you are expected to ascertain the date of manufacture of the router.  Routers manufactured too far in the past, according to NETGEAR protocol, could invalidate your chances of getting installation assistance.  In that case, the installation assistance people will demand that you provide them with a copy of proof of purchase (i.e. the receipt) prior to them spending the 5 minutes helping you to set up your router.  If you do not have sufficient proof of purchase you will be invited to purchase, for approximately the cost of the router, an assistance plan where these same people will supposedly help you install your router.  The same applies to a time period (90 days was my case) between purchasing and attempting to set-up your router.  A delay in installation may make their promise of installation assistance invalid, according to their protocols, which of course you will not know at the time of purchase.Oh wait.  The 90 day thing is in very very small print on the side of the box.  The promise of installation assistance is in large print on the front of the box.Good luck.",,,

Was able to set up manually with some help from the website. Worked reasonably well for just over a year, then died (power adapter was still good). Contacted customer support by email and was directed to try a couple of things that were for a bricked condition not a dead one (basic reset and a 3-3-3 reset, didn't work). After @ 3 email cycles I was informed that my router was out of warranty but each new tech, after apoligizing, would try to see what they could do. They always ending the email with 'Thanks again for choosing NETGEAR. Have a great day!' Myself, not feeling good about choosing Netgear or having a nice day but definately getting the runaround. I wasn't looking for a freebe and asked the next tech if I could have it repaired thinking they might be interested in why their product failed. I was informed that they didn't do that, but they apoligized and would see what they could do. It became evident they weren't going to do anything but couldn't say that to me. They were just waiting for me to give up and go away so after the sixth email cycle I closed the case. So the result is $99 for @ 13 months, not the best deal around, at least Amazon gave me free shipping. Must not be a rare incident because I see more of their routers now come with a limited lifetime warranty. They could of done something for me after all the customer support merry-go-round.",,,

1482,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,2,2,20-Apr-13,ASEWUBEFXVXUE,Very poor support,"I bought this based on the glowing reports of its power and range as a WiFi router.  Everything was fine until I upgraded to a new firmware version released by Netgear.  After setting up everything in my home network including wireless printing and NAS access for bot Mac's and PC's, I was very troubled to find that there was communication between my networked devices had been knocked out.  I spent hours upon hours reinstalling drivers but no avail until I did a little research and found that the new firmware that Netgear had released 1.0.0.32 did not support communications with networked devices...Correct me here but I think that's one of the basic functions of a wireless network.  On top of that when you call Netgear support they will help you if you pay them to help fix a problem they caused.After four months of people complaining they released another version of the frimware that would fix the wireless communication problem but their firmware utility did not recognize the new version of firmware as compatible with the router.  So now you have to go through a process of using something called TFTP, reset the router to factory settings, wire a laptop directly to the router using a static IP address and then reflash the firmware back to the version before 1.0.0.32.  The only redeeming thing about Netgear is that they keep old versions of the firmware on their website.My advice to you is to stick with a manufacturer that is good...which is anyone but Netgear...Linksys / Cisco is good, heck Belkin was very good.  If I had not spent so much money on this router I would have just junked it and bought one from a company that understands consumer technology.BUY NETGEAR ONLY IF YOU ARE REALLY WANT TO TEST YOUR TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT SKILLS....If you just want a router that works buy Cisco.",,,

Big mistake. I purchased this item in nov 2012.  Since the beginning I have had several issues, have had to reset back to factory settings numerous times and now it is not working at all. When I called Netgear support (Which was an act in futility in itself) they told me that for the price of $39, the could help me fix the configuration. I work for a technology company and am comfortable with technology. The fact that I cannot figure out the issue on my own is the first red flag. The second issue is that according to their support line, the configuration was messed up because of some sort of a power surge.  In the 10 years of owning my Linksys device, I never had that issue. But even so, shouldn't I be able to configure it myself without giving NetGear more money?  This has been such a huge headache. I cannot imagine how the occasional user might figure out this device without having any technical background if I have had such issues.  Poor product. poor customer service.",,,

Then, everything was slowing down and I was having to cycle the power daily. Finally, I called tech support (farmed out to India) and spent hours with them slowly and painfully trying to change settings. Each time they said they'd keep my ticket open in case the problem wasn't fixed. Well, I'm again on the phone, was disconnected right after they said they'd call me back w/in 60 seconds, called back and asked for a manager, was transferred, but no answer, then disconnected again. Called back again and disconnected again. Not my phone. I simply can't get competent help from these people, aside from a product that works correctly (my wired connection to the router is 1/2 the speed if I go directly from modem to computer). Still can't get a call to last with them or get the help I need.About 3 months ago, we bought the N900 and it worked well. I needed another router and went with this one. I won't be going with Netgear again. I simply hate it when a company throws you into a never ending queue with people who don't fix the problem, and finally when the connection stinks b/c it's 1/2 way around the world.WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. I welcome any attempt by Netgear to address this situation and will update this review if and when they do.Update Apr 5:Been on the phone w/ tech support daily. Each day they guarantee that the router changes they were making would fix it. 3 or 4 technicians kept assuring me (literally). Yesterday, the tech said they'd replace if I had more issues. More issues, call back, and then the new tech guarantees to me he can fix in 10 minutes. That they didn't want to replace, even after saying they would is just bad customer service on many levels. So, another hour of my time eaten up w/ this shoddy product, poor service, and waiting on hold on the phone. Now the customer service rep says the version 4 is out of stock and wants to give me a version 3, saying it's just the same (it's $30 less since v3 is discontinued). On hold to speak to a manager. If you went to buy a car and they wanted to switch you out to the older model would you do it? Absolutely not and it's ridiculous that they are trying to force me into it. Spoke to a manager after insisting and the manager says they'll 'try' to put me into the same product but can't guarantee. WHAT?! It's the brand new product and he can't guarantee I'll get what I bought, but wants to give me a discontinued model.

The rep sort of slipped and told me that even though the product worked for me originally it might not have been set up correctly. 90 day support in my opinion is to make sure you hook it up. Actually it is so you dont return it to the store. Retailers demand that. Since I cant return it I might be stuck and get something else from another manufacturer.

1830,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,0,0,27-Jan-13,A1DS66XKA6MKAN,Caution: Limited Dynamic DNS options,"Previous review: Three starsAll in all a decent router for basic usage.  However if you are looking at the Dynamic DNS functionality to run services from computers in your home (Nanny cams, remotely manage files on your computer, etc) is quite lacking in that only one provider (DynDNS.org) is supported.  It is missing support for all the other large DNS providers out there, eg: no-ip.com, freedns.org, zoneedit.com, etc.  If you are already using one of these other providers, you can not use your account with this router.  Let's hope they update their firmware in the future to address this deficiency.-------------------------------------------UPDATE: Changed to ONE starBECAUSE: As of May 2013, Dyn.com has changed their policy that only allows 1 month of service (without continuously logging into their site). This makes Dynamic DNS operation on Netgear equipment effectively unusable.  DO NOT buy Netgear if you want to use Dynamic DNS with a free provider of your choice.",,,

1867,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,2,2,27-Feb-14,A271V4VR7SZEMB,Worse than useless with stock software.,"This device features some pretty decent hardware. Unfortunately, with the included software, describing it as worthless would be charitable. Do not consider this device for even one moment unless your very first step will be to reflash it.The software is so terrible that it makes one seriously wonder why the people responsible for it are even allowed to touch a computer keyboard without adult supervision.First and foremost, this router deliberately gives root access to anyone who asks. There is a special service running for the purpose of doing just that. Your administrator password is irrelevant; the magic packet is a hard-coded value that cannot be changed. This level of negligence may be hard to believe -- search the web for 'netgear telnetenable' to see it for yourself.Even if that doesn't bother you, hope you don't need much of a custom configuration because many (most?) of the functionality is badly broken. For example, changing certain settings simply has no effect until you reboot. No, it doesn't tell you to reboot -- you learn that on your own after trying to figure out why the heck it's not doing what it says it will. For instance, adding a reserved DHCP address -- it will display the reservation but continue assigning dynamic IPs until the router reboots.That might not be such a big deal either, except that after rebooting, the router will not connect to the Internet until the cablemodem (plugged into the router's uplink port) is rebooted, too. This is especially great when the router reboots itself for no good reason, and you're not home to reset the cablemodem. There'll be no Internet connection until you do that.There are other issues but just thinking about the incompetence is grating on my nerves, so I'll stop here. Do not buy this device. You will regret it.",,,

I currently have a WNR1000 which is fine for my needs, except, in this house, we barely get a signal in our bedroom. So I figured I'd look for a full-fledged N router with a better range and maybe some extras. I saw this one and decided it looked like a safe bet. The WNR1000 page has a comparison chart showing the WNDR3700 with two more bars (5 compared to 3!), so I figured it would give us plenty of signal strength. I was completely and utterly wrong. The 5GHz band disappears completely halfway down the hall. The 2.4GHz band has roughly the same signal, but slightly less, on the three devices I tried with it - a desktop computer, a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, and a PS3. The PS3 actually gave the percentages as 50% for our old router and 47% for the WNDR3700, despite them being sided by side and with the WNDR3700 actually between me and the other router.Sending this POS back.",,,

First off, the router was super fast with super far range before the newest firmware update became available.  Then it was a disaster.Netgear customer service is nuts!!!!  They are mean and difficult to deal with.  Their main focus is to not help you, and sell you their premium support plan.  They require proof of purchase to even talk to you for free.Im am intermediate to advanced level as far as my experience with computers.  I found it difficult to handle when I knew more than the their support group.For whatever reason, my computer refused to open the firmware upgrade.  I have file extractors that can read all types of files.I wanted the best router for the price.  But man did I ever put myself through hell.I cant get more than 2 bars at 20 ft away, and no reception at 50 ft.  When I first purchased the range was 4 of 5 bars 200 ft away.I cant take it.

Unfortunatly, it's been more than 90 days since I bought this from the local brick and mortar- and I refuse to deal with Netgear through the mail (noting their poor reputation I have read about here and elsewhere).I have purchased and used Netgear routers and switches for years and was reasonably satisfied until my experience with this router.I do have the 'v2' version, so I will try to flash an alternate firmware and see if that solves my stability issues.

AND CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS!","UPDATE: 1/12/2013: Decided to give the folks at netgear a chance and boy was it a nightmare! The first guy wants to know why I had to reset my box. It was funny, he did not even want to listen to the issue. The second guy, was better but wanted me to go through a 'series of steps' that would fix it guaranteed. I asked him what those were and I get a set of steps that I have tried a 100 times. He also went on to tell me how it can take a while for the switch to get an internet connection. It was hilarious and obvious that this guy did not no anything. I asked for 2nd level of support and he put me on hold for 30 minutes and eventually disconnected. The third guy was really trying to help but had no authority whatsoever to send me a newer version of this same router to check if the problem is rectified. I told them that I had, not one but 3 of these routers (same version tested). Finally I got to 2nd level support (3 hours, no kidding) have passed by this time. This person wants me to do an packet capture using wireshark (of a connection that is working fine). I told her I can send in my router config file and that's it. Two days later, I got an email asking for some information. A day later, I get a smart answer that has not tested anywhere close to what my config is (with a SB6121 modem). I told him that and haven't heard back. It has been a week. If I can demote this to 0 stars, I absolutely will.UPDATE: 1/6/2013: Had to power cycle the modem in order to connect a hard drive. I ended up spending the same 3 hours yet again to get the connection to work. Now I am not even sure what I did to get it working! I did the routine Reset Modem->Switch DHCP to manual -> Switch to Secure ->Switch to DHCP->Switch to NAT and it did not work! It just wants you to babysit for 3 minutes for some undocumented race condition to occur that causes everything to work again. The Hard-drive connection itself works great. Again, I do not know if people with a DSL connection have similar issues. Fact is version2 of this router worked without issues. It is difficult for me to point fingers at the cable modem.UPDATE 12/15: Had the unfortunate experience of rebooting the router and the internet connection issue was back. This time though, I had an IP address. I was able to ping the gateway (not the 192.168.1.1 but comcast's gateway). Turn off dhcp and manual setting works but not when dhcp is enabled. Restoring the settings from a backup I had saved when I finally got it to work earlier was not of use either. After 3 hours and down-grading the router to 18 (from 22), things worked. Surprisingly enough the issue 22 addresses is a LAN-WAN setup issue but the webserver GUI has also been modified.  dont have the patience to reboot again (the whole process to get it working took 3 hours and I know networking reasonably well). The issue definitely is in the router (why else would v2 work without issues) but netgear insists the problem is with the cable modem. Be prepared to spend a lot of time if you buy this router.I have comcast high-speed and I bought my own cable modem (SB6121 by Motorola). I have never had any issues with the modem that combined with my N300 router. I saw this router as part of the lightning deal for 70 bucks. The first router I was sent was a 3700v2 (whereas the v3 was advertised on the webpage). I noticed it and spoke to customer service to have a v3 shipped which I got within a day. There are internal differences between v2 and v3 in terms of the chipsets being used. All reviews pointed to the v2 having a better wireless connectivity overall. The main difference between v2 and v3 (user perceivable) is that v3 has a USB3.0 port which allows for better streaming from a connected storage. Also, v3 has a faster processor overall and should be able to take its DLNA duties in addition to its wireless duties better.I had no problems installing the v2 (and I did not realize it until I saw it on the user webpage). The v3, on the other hand, was a different animal. It simply would not allow the modem to connect to the internet. It turns out that both my modem and the router have a DHCP server which was causing a problem. When I setup the router in bridge mode (and manually assigned the IP address), reset the modem, internet was up and running! The minute I turned on DHCP on the router, everything went for a toss (wired and wireless). Surprisingly through all this turmoil, my vonage box was working flawlessly. After much trial and error, there was a setting called 'NAT filtering' and I moved this from Secure to Open. Lo and behold (and after a factory reset of the modem), everything was working very well. The wireless connectivity has been pretty solid and both 2.4 and 5 work very well (and simultaneously) and I did not perceive any difference from v2.DLNA streaming of movies and music work fine. However, when I map the the hard drive, I barely get about 3MBps. I know that the hard drive is capable of about 20-30MBps. This was with a computer connected directly thro a gigabit switch (and thro' the router port as well). Poorly designed. In fact, I am moving the hard drive behind another computer simply because of this reason.",,,

I would avoid any Netgear products.After a month of exchanging emails my problem still did not get resolved.

Everything was easy to set up, which was nice... until it kept killing my long-lived SSH connections.  No rhyme or reason, the router would just drop the connection.  This was not good.  I ended up replacing this WNDR3700v3 with a used WNDR4000, which does not drop connections.Also note that this WNDR3700v3 is NOT compatible with DD-WRT or any (at the time of this writing) alternative firmwares.

That was the last good thing about it.Fail #1: The instructions for setting up the router are pretty simple: 'plug in, wait for it to boot, navigate to its internal web page for configuration'.  Simple, right?  And it was, except the router refused to serve up the web page.  The connection to it (both WiFi and ethernet) was good, my computer was getting an IP address, I could ping the router, just couldn't do anything else.Fail #2: I called tech support, hoping I was doing something wrong or there is some magic they can recommend.  Good news: very little time on hold.  Bad news: they refused to help me until I registered the product by giving them my phone number, email address and other information.  Absolutely refused to do anything prior to that.Fail #3: After I finally registered, I got transfered to tech support.  10 minutes on hold, 15 minutes of support specialist having me go through troubleshooting steps (nothing I haven't tried myself already, but I do it again) and he tells me 'looks like the device is broken, you should go back to where you bought it and get it replaced.'  Not a 'we are overnighting you a replacement because we allowed a broken product to be sold to you,' not a 'what can we do to restore your faith in our company.'  I didn't want to wait for the back and forth with Amazon, so I asked for other options.  He had the audacity to offer me the option of Netgear overnighting me a replacement with ME HAVING TO PAY FOR SHIPPING.  His supervisor refused to make any further accommodations.Fail #4: Figuring I may have better luck with their Live Chat support, I gave that a shot.  Very quickly the agent recognized that the over the phone support specialist forgot to have me try a firmware upgrade over TFTP.  While working through the steps the session gets disconnected, and I have to start over with another rep.  This rep has absolutely no understanding of even basic technology!  He was clearly reading from a script, and his answers changed with each reading.  Finally I had to figure out myself what needed to be done, but of course the router is broken enough that it wouldn't even take the upgrade.To summarize; the router appears to be suffering from a very serious malfunction making it completely inoperable.  But what makes things 100 times worse is the incompetence of Netgear's support personnel and their clear disregard for their customers.I will never again buy a Netgear product, and this router is on its way back to Amazon.",,,

Went to the web, found some older posts that said I should reformat the drive for best results.  Copied off the files to a computer, reformatted drive.

A series of radio buttons, if you choose poor, you get additional options.  I chose poor, and the question said: 'Choose all that apply'.  To a set of radio buttons.  Of which you can only choose one.  And I realized:  This company does not care about customer support, they don't even care enough to make their survey work, and I decided to spend at least 3 hours today making sure other people have a chance to avoid these issues by selecting a different company to work for, since that is approximately the amount of time I've spent dealing with their customer nonsupport.",,,

Spent 4 HOURS online with an agent who would not give me a higher level tech, who made the problem worse by changing settings so that even with an Ethernet cable, the router didn't work. I suggested re reset with the pin-in-the-hole method; he didn't.And my daughter looked at the log which stated service was blocked. The tech support person didn't even know where to find the log. Finally, got an RMA.Then My daughter checked a setting in the firewall, changed it, and now no drops. The tech support did not even ask about my firewall, even after we read the log to him. Very bad service.By the way, tech provider is not NetGear. It is IYogi and they take over your computer, then send endless emails with attachments to download. Be very careful of these people.Remember, I am only average tech knowledge but I was the one who reset the dang thing when he made it inoperable.ADVICE: Check your firewall settings, especially if using Kaspersky.Tech support told me he had to try at least 3 times and have failure before authorizing RMA. Nice for Netgear but certainly not customer oriented.Moreover, for Netgear to replace, I have to pay shipping back AND be without the router while they process everything. Otherwise, I have to pay for the new router. For expedited shipping, I also have to pay.",,,

It worked great for a bit then just as we approach the 30-day return mark it decided to decrease it's signal reach then communicate with the cable modem any time it felt like it.As for returning it - I contacted the seller and Amazon.  I was told I could get a full refund by the seller and forwarded this information to Amazon.  I did not get a FULL refund.  I was told I would receive the cost of the item $60.99 MINUS a 'Restocking Fee Refund Deduction' of $12.20.  Restocking fee? For a defective item?  Never again will I bother.,,,

I find out that there are only 5 hard drives that Netgear tested and got to function with this thing, non of which I own, and I am not about to spend more money on another hard drive. Seems to me they should not have advertised this feature. For as long as Netgear has been in the technology industry, one would think they would be a bit further in their own technological advances.Customer service is of no help, they keep closing my cases and only apologize for my experience, but never for their deceitful advertising of a feature that is useless. I wouldn't really have a problem purchasing another drive, but the five listed suck or do not have the capacity I am looking for.Pro: It connects you to the internetcon:interface is nice, but can be confusing, even for someone who has a lot of experience setting routers up. Features are not what they are sold to be. ****Update**** the new interface, through the firmware update, is a little more complex and takes some getting use to. Finding your basic settings that you need to access right away takes more time to locate. It would be nice if you could modify, and add quick links or favorites to settings you access on a regular basis.Buy a Linksys/Cisco for less money!My apologies: It seems they updated their firmware, and their link with what hard drives work, but it is still a small list. I have a Seagate 1TB that doesn't work, neither does the WD and the Toshiba that I have.here is the link to the list: [...]*****UPDATE*********After some time using, I am glad to tell you that it has been reliable. One thing that has changed is that my printer was hooked up via USB, and I came to realize the other day that the printer is using the wireless connection and the router is not recognizing the printer through the USB ports on the router. Same issue still exists with the External hard drives. I wish they would have put 2 more Ethernet ports on it, instead of the useless USB ports. Tech support has failed to give me a satisfactory answer, outside of me buying more equipment that may, or may not work with this device.",,,

I work from home sometimes , so I have to remain 'On line all the time'. With that being said, I have a very extensive background in networking (TCP/IP, BGP, OSPF, Layer2/3/4/7, switching, MPLS, etc), software engineering (asm/c/c++).This product is awful for reasons I cannot even begin to put on paper.- The help file never matches newer firmware updates (if you look at certain options they are missing from the right hand side help menu)- No support for High DBI antenna (external)- Limited IPv6 options:-- This doesn't support 6in4 tunnels with IPv6, whereas older linksys stuff does.- No jumbo frame support on the gig ports. (who ships a 'router' with gig ports and no jumbo frames?)- No VLAN support (really?)- No IPSec tunnel support- High CPU usage from large amounts of port saturation (non-WiFi, connected gig-e ports. With straight Layer2 I should be getting close to line rate but I can't even get 350mbit! Seems this is software switched.- Primitive firewall with bogus options.-- Synflood blocking is silly, because most synfloods that I know of are in the orders of magnitude higher than my ISP gives me.-- This router seems to send ICMP_PORT_UNREACHABLEs on firewall rulesets, potentially causing a backscatter attack with spoofed IPs.- Router reboots/clears all wifi endpoints on basic configuration changes- The lights on the router for the ports is backwards.There are others, but that is a showstopper for me.",,,

The wireless signal range for both frequencies on the new router terrible, worse than the old router I was replacing.I could connect to the internet with two iPads, a Blackberry, but while I could connect my HP Pavilion laptop running Windows Vista to the router via wireless, I couldn't connect to the internet. Spent quite a few hours troubleshooting and just gave up. I went to the Netgear forums online and found some posts with exactly the same problem I have, but no solutions yet.Bought a new laptop running Windows 8, and can now connect via wireless to the Internet. But the RANGE ON THIS ROUTER IS REALLY, REALLY TERRIBLE. Seems almost like it needs to be in line of sight to work. I'm barely 15 feet away in another room and connection drops in & out. Signal doesn't cover my apartment which is about a 100 sq. ft.Very disappointed.",,,
2282,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,2,3,12-Sep-12,A191CME6W62U7X,Stay Away!!,"I felt I must share my first review with all prospective buyers. I bought the NETGEAR Wireless Router - N600 Dual Band Gigabit (WNDR3700)router to update my outdated equipment that you lease from Comcast. I didn't buy the product from Amazon but at the local Best Buy. I got the router up and going the first day without much problems. I have a Toshiba laptop, Toshiba tablet, 2 Droid phones, wireless printer and a Play Station. Everything seemed to work fine for the first week. The signal quality definitely wasn't very strong as advertised. I was barely getting signal (1-2 bars) in my bedroom on the second floor unlike my old router but that wasn't the deal breaker. Sitting 10 feet away from the router only got 4/5 bars... Then the real problems started beginning after 4 weeks. Signal would drop continually and eventually I called customer support in India. 'Danny' said my firmware needs updating and he will help get it done quickly. Well and hour later we seemed to be back up and connected. Everything seemed fine again til the same problem started happening dropped signal, hard reboots and 3 more calls to India. Multiple hours trying to fix the problem. He blamed the Play Station is causing the conflict. He changed setting to make the router basically run at 54 mbps on one channel and said that should fix your problems. He was right but why did I buy a router with 300 mbps capabilities and run on 2 channels-my old Linksys has the same capabilities. I called customer service again questioning the new settings and wanting to talk to a supervisor. Well twice I was put on hold waiting for this supervisor and after 20 minutes I got disconnected... I called again, talked to customer service expressing my dissatisfaction with the whole experience and this time I was not put on hold. I was HUNG UP ON! Well I packed it up in the box and drop down to Best Buy. Well that was the best part of the experience was getting my money back. STAY AWAY FROM NET GEAR, THEIR POOR FIRMWARE AND THEIR TERRIBLE OUTSOURCED CUSTOMER SERVICE.",,,

The router died in less than 12 months, stopped sending out a wireless signal, and then it wouldn't turn on. Plus, it says lifetime warranty, but you have to pay 30 dollars to get a replacement and you have to send your router back first before they will send you a new one. Oh, and they were going to send me a cheaper one. The customer service representative could barely speak English and he was frustrated that I couldn't understand him and he wasn't understanding me. HORRIBLE customer service. Plus, he was supposed to be tech support, but when I told him that I couldn't turn it on, he told me 5 times to just turn on the router, even though I told him it wouldn't turn on. I had to put my husband on the phone.As for the warranty, there are no refunds, they flat out refuse to refund, and you have to pay almost 50% of the cost of a new one to get a replacement.

I received this router on 8/22/12 - that's 4 1/2 months. I called my internet company and a technician came today 1/7/13, he upgraded my internet modem, and turned out what was wrong with my internet was the damned router had quit working properly! The thing now only gives full speed only if I'm sitting within ONE FOOT (~18.54Mbps download),but if I am as little as *14 FEET* away from the router the download speed drops to 4Mbps); at 16 feet distance = signal disappears completely. I tried resetting to factory settings, checked the cables, everything, the thing just stopped working. I will never ******* buy from Netgear again.UPDATE 11/22/12:I'm bumping the rating from 4 stars back to 5 stars. It's been 2 months 3 weeks since I purchased this router - and still - not a single dropped signal since I updated the firmware! The speed is good (130Mbps) when &lt;=50 feet from router. I haven't yet learned how to get higher speed but I'm happy with this speed. This router is very reliable and I'm extremely happy with it because it is reliable and fast and gives 0 dropped signals!-------- This router gets 4/5 stars for two reasons:1) Range: at 50+ feet the speeds are halved (go from 130Mbps to 65Mbps or even less).2) Out of the promised 600Mbps I only get 130Mbps (within 50 feet of router).*I've had this router for 10 days. If anything happens I'll update my review for you all to know.*Within 50 feet my two laptops get 130Mbps speeds; but the desktop gets 1.0Gbps speed (directly connected to this router).*I needed a new router to use as a bridge/access point to expand the range in my home because my four-year-old WNDR3300 v1's range was the same (only good if &lt; 50 feet from router).*Within a few minutes I successfully connected my refurbished WNDR3700 v2 to my old WNDR3300 v1 and now I have faster speeds and my range was doubled (two routers = 100 feet range at max speed). Now I have two routers connected to my home network!*I'm able to edit the settings of both routers (routerlogin.com in web browser). (Example: to edit Router #1 I just have to log into that network and I can edit it in routerlogin.com, and to edit Router #2 I just have to log into its network and then I can edit it in routerlogin.com).*I got lucky and got v2 - only v1 & v2 are supported for dd-wrt firmware, while v3 is not yet supported.*The firmware it came with eventually (after one day) led to dropped signals but ever since I updated the firmware I have not experienced any dropped signals! It has been ONE MONTH since I got the router and no dropped signals within 50 feet and rarely when further than 50 feet from router.*WNDR3300 v1 speed: 54.0Mbps speeds*WNDR3700 V2 speed: 130.0Mbps (maximum should be 600Mbps) = this is why I'm giving it 4/5 stars - because I'm not getting the promised speed. I need to google how to get more speed out of my routers.*The description should state which version it is selling. I got v2 but another reviewer got v3. If you're considering installing dd-wrt, you should contact the seller first and ask to get v1 or v2.*I received my order in three days.*I received WNDR3700 v2 (there exist three versions)*I've owned a WNDR3300 v1 (only version ever released) for over four years and I'm very happy with it. The last firmware released 3+ years ago fixed the signal dropping problem and I have NEVER had a dropped signal ever since! It is an extremely reliabble router and I love it. It also supports dd-wrt firmware.*I bought the WNDR3700 because it has faster speeds and range, but primarily to expand the range of my home network.---There are two methods for connecting two routers to the same home network.*Method #1: change the IP address of the second router to prevent interference and connect the second router to the first router - done. (E.g.: Router #1 = 192.168.1.1 ; Router #2 = 192.168.1.2). I followed this guide called 'How to Connect Two Wireless Routers Together' by Amit Agarwal.*Method #2: requires installing the dd-wrt firmware. I did not follow this method but if you wish to follow then google how to do it.I bought this router specifically also because two of the three versions are supported for dd-wrt, so I figured, if method #1 didn't work, then I could have method #2 as plan B. But I'm glad method #1 worked because it was so quick and easy. Method #2 has the risk of 'bricking' your router if the instructions are not followed correctly. For now I'll stay with the stock firmware and if I'm unhappy I can always change to the dd-wrt firmware, but I doubt I will need to.I'll update my review to report back on if signal ever drops, reliability, speed, etc.UPDATE 9/17/12:It has been one month since I got this router and I am extremely happy with it. When within 50 feet the signal NEVER drops. When further than 50 feet the signal RARELY 'hangs'. But it's super rare. In the ONE MONTH I've had the router it happened like 3x while I was further than 50 feet but I fixed it simply by logging out from the network and re-connecting to it - simple and quick.When within 50 feet the signal has never dropped.I'm so glad I bought this router to double my home range.  - I'll update my review in the future again ^^.",,,

This is by far the worst. The firmware is buggy. Wireless signals frequently fade, clients are regularly dropped (even at full signal strength) and the router requires frequent restarts. Traffic is frequently blocked between devices (NAS, printer, laptops, etc) until the router is restarted.  Customer support is also substandard. Stay away.",,,

Instead, I have a router that causes me nonstop aggravation. The wireless connection gets disconnected randomly, I've had to power cycle three times in four days, and setup was a hassle. Every small change in configuration disconnects all the computers while the settings are being applied. On the other hand, the very reason that I bought it- to get QoS for torrent downloads, isn't doing its job. I'm probably going to go back to the old D-Link I had before. In short: if you're considering spending top dollar for a great router, get the other one.",,,

It wasn't an option to return it to Amazon as it was past the time it was allowed.I'm willing to work with you guys on this reliability issue.  My firmware version is V1.0.0.22_1.0.17 which the router SW thinks is the latest and greatest (ie no new updates available).4 SSIDs being used (broadcasted, in other words not hidden)2 on 2.4 GHz (primary + guest) w/ WPA2-PSK security2 on 5.0 GHz (primary + guest) w/ WPA2-PSK securityIssue is around wireless AP, no issues on wired interfaces-----Bought this back in February 2012.  Made sure router had latest and greatest firmware.  Tons of reliability issues from (1) connection drop outs (2) unable to connect and (3) throughput from iPhone4, iPhone 4s, iPad 2nd gen and Mac Book Pro (mid 2012 model).

2349,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,6,6,31-Jul-12,A3W4NLU1LAA153,Constant lock ups and the wifi eventually died,"My previous internet setup was a combined modem and router but in December 2011 I finally split into a separate pair, and this Netgear formed the Wifi router part of my network. The setup was relatively straightforward and the admin pages are fairly easy to navigate. I was able to get it up and running within a few minutes and all my wired and wireless devices hopped on without any problem. The guest network was nice too for visitors. So for the first few weeks it seemed to work without too much issue but then the problems started - online gaming would report locked down 'strict' or 'limited' access, wifi would drop out, wired devices would drop their network connections. At least once a week it would need a hard power-off reboot. Speeds were wildly variable on the wired part of the network, despite being hardwired into a 24-port gigabit switch. I struggled along with it until July 2012 when I woke up one morning to discover a super high-pitched whine coming from the unit and it had no Wifi. The status lights indicated the Wifi was on, as did the setup pages, but sniffing for Wifi using InSSIDer (wifi snooper software) revealed the unit was not broadcasting even a carrier signal. Netgear's support is awful and their phone lines go to India where 'Bob' can't understand a word you say. They only have a 90-day warranty so anything beyond that and you're paying to even get an RMA number for returns. What I essentially understood was that I could send the unit back to them but I'd get a refurb unit in return. Which I'd have to pay for.I run IT for a couple of small stores and am pretty knowledgeable about network hardware but I've never come across a router that's fried itself so quickly. Very disappointed with Netgear's support and their product in general. I think I'll pass on their devices in future - one of their 5-port desktop switches failed on me last month so that's two products in two months. #fail.",,,

Good speed, gigabit, decent UI.Updated to the latest manufacturer firmware (V1.0.7.98NA), and now I literally have to be within 2 feet of the router to get a wireless signal.  Absolutely unacceptable.Worse, based on *dozens* of bad reviews on Netgear support, I have no faith in getting it replaced via RMA, or that the replacement won't just abruptly stop working one day either.

2484,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,0,2,3-Jun-12,A17BE971YXLSXK,"Fine for web browsing, but NOT for professionals","I bought this router to replace my old Linksys WRTG router. I figured, it's a $100 router, it must be good! Using it with Vista and Windows 7, there's something wrong with the router's ability to process packets. It's fine for web browsing where it's OK to re-send requests a lot, but for things like connecting to NASes or FTPing files, it constantly drops and fragments packets. NAS communication is SLOW (3mb/sec) and stuttering. You'll get constant timeouts communicating with FTP servers. All my problems went away when I switched back to the WRTG, so I'm sure it's the router's fault.On top of that, the admin website for the router is poorly laid out, and makes things like finding where to change the MTU a pain. If you know what MTU stands for, do yourself a favor, and don't buy this router. It's so not worth the money. Go with a Linksys instead.",,,

The router not even showing up to connect.  There are forums filled with people with problems with this device.  I even bought a Netgear repeater to fix the problems.  Didn't work, and kept dropping the signal with the router reviewed here.Netgear said they'll troubleshoot it if I pay them to do so.Instead of taking that step, I plugged in my girlfriend's 3 year old Linksys router.  No more problems.  4 bars from the same spot the Netgear router wouldn't even show up.",,,
2512,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,7,7,16-May-12,AFBPLAQ5CXMMO,Warranty Shenanigans,"I purchase this router in September.  All was fine until a couple months ago when the router's signal started deteriorating. Now the signal is so weak, I have to be in the same room to connect.  Netgear has a 1 year warranty on parts and labor, but only 90 days on Technical Support.  Since I have a Bachelor Degree in Business Information Systems, I troubleshooted the problem as being a defective router. (A known issue with this router).  Support told me instead of getting an RMA, I need for Netgear to troubleshoot the problem first.  He also, that the troubleshooting cost $39.95 per half hour of support.  I said, I know it is defective and give me an RMA.  He said policy is to do tech support first.  I said, go ahead and troubleshoot, I am not going to pay $39.95 each half hour for you to tell me it is defective, what type of scam is Netgear running.  Bottomline, they are not honoring their warranty by forcing people to pay for tech support, they don't need.Stay away.Update, after trying to get help over the phone, it looks like you can get help with the router through email/written support.  The customer service reps never mentioned this option to me in the beginning.  They wanted to push their phone tech support that cost money.  It actually looks like Netgear turned their phone tech support over to a third party and they are trying to make the callers use their service at $39.95 every half hour.So if you have a problem after the first 90 days, use the email tech support system if you don't want to pay for phone support. Email support was able to verify what I told them, that my router radio signals were defective.  I have gotten the RMA and I should have a working router shortly (I hope).",,,

Then a middling-to-mediocre router got bad. It started dropping connections and restarting itself at odd intervals. I got fed up and, in a moment of desperation, started rooting around in my closet and found a linksys router (wrt54g) that had been gathering dust under some sandals for 3 years or more. When I had thrown it in there, it had felt like any other piece of cheap plastic equipment, but after dealing with the netgear this thing felt as solid as a rock! And it worked like a champ.

Decided to buy two of these for separate locations. Initially, everything was as advertised. Set-up was easy. Performance was good. However, a few months into using these the performance began to degrade and frequent reboots were required (one began behaving like this at 6 months and the other at 8 months). When the first device began to experience problems I contacted Netgear Support. This was a miserable experience!!! The first two techs could not help me and directed me to premium support. The person in premium support said that if I signed up for $75 he would give me the URL to download new firmware, which he assured me would address the issue. Against my better judgement, I went ahead and signed up - this seemed like a ridiculous amount of $$ given the prescribed fix, but I was in a jam.... After giving me the URL the line was disconnected. Given that the support center is in India, they had preemptively asked me to give them two numbers (primary + backup) so that they could contact me in case of a disconnect. I waited, but they did not call me back. I then downloaded the firmware myself and it did not remedy the issue. I then called my credit card company to cancel payment on the $75 fee. A WEEK later I received a call from the hostile support tech who did NOT help me. He complained that he'd called me back - he had not done so - and that he'd provided me the URL and didn't understand why I requested a refund. Bottomline, if you're expecting a high quality product and courteous and competent technical support, do NOT go with Netgear. I will never buy one of their products again.",,,

Yup, the router went bad.........after 60 days.I will see if I can return it.  I will get a different brand, though.BTW, the router was not moved since I had set it up.  It had plenty of air to keep it cool... and, in fact, it was not very warm at all when I pulled it out.

It was past the 30 days for NewEgg to replace so I was referred to NetGear to fix the problem and that's when my problems really started. They said they would replace it but it would take 2 weeks or 24 hrs if I would agree to pay them $30. Well we argued this point to a standstill. So I was to wait to hear from their customer service department (surprised they call it that) on an approval of a next day replacement minus the $30 bucks.....it never came so here I sit almost a week has gone by and still no replacement or one on the way.I recontacted NetGear about the status of my replacement and not to my supprise they have not done anything on it.

I started to search for a fix and found out on the Netgear forums that this is a very common if not systematic problem with this router. Those fortunate enough to have this happen while under warranty Netgear would only replace the units with a 'refurbished' model.  They wouldn't consider giving me one for their faulty router.

I have over 100 media files on my media storage and it only shows me four files.

The last case drove me to write this review.  After a couple of days of puzzling over why I could connect to the internet but not browse, I finally determined, with excellent help from my ISP (TW RR Cable), that DNS was failing with the Netgear router. So I called Netgear support expecting to get a simple software update.  After going through a long ID and problem verification session, the tech finally got me to a file to be downloaded.  The tech told me to call back after completing the download for instructions on how to finish the problem fix.  Of course when I called back, I got another support person who seemed to have no information about my case, even though I had a case number, and he had to run me through the same ID and problem verification as before.  Then when I thought I was finally going to get instructions on what to do with the downloaded file, the support person noticed that I was beyond the 90 day free support period and refused to proceed further.  Instead, he passed me to a third person who had to get all my personal and product ID information all over again. I didn't realize it then, but this third person's job was just to sell a support service plan, and the cheapest plan he offered was a 6 month plan for $79.99. By this time I was so fustrated and anxious to get to a solution that I overlooked the fact that I could have bought a new router for less, and I made the mistake of giving the guy a credit card number.  I was also mistaken to think that he would then proceed to explain what to do with the downloaded file.  No, instead he gave me a new case number and passed me to yet another person who also needed to know who I was and what the problem was with my router. By then my patience had run out and my voice was pretty loud so she dumped me off to still another person who seemed to have gotten the idea that something actually needed to be done. But first he wanted me to reconnect the router to my computer, since I had been by-passing the router with a direct wire to the modem.  And while I was doing that, he hung up!  I am now trying to get my credit card company to cancel the $79.99 charge.  I do not want to deal with Netgear again, ever!",,,

In essence, this router is warrantied for 90 days only, any additional warranty will cost you the price of the product itself thus doubling the cost of your router.

2806,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,2,2,23-Jan-12,A2WFX4TC9CAAH2,"Won't handle Canon Wi-Fi printer, and good luck with Netgear support!","All was well till I bought a new Canon Wi-Fi all-in-one printer (model Pixma MX882). This router will not maintain a wi-fi connection with that printer for longer than around 15 minutes after printing the last page. To restore the wi-fi connection with the router, you have to either power cycle the printer, or on the printer control panel switch it temporarily to wired LAN, then back to wireless.Is this a Canon flaw or a Netgear flaw? Canon will tell you if you have ANY other wireless device in your home, that device will 'steal the IP address of the printer.' No, that makes no sense, and even if you disable every wireless device in your home, it won't solve the problem. Canon then will tell you it's a Netgear problem. Well - at least Canon support is free and their call center is in Virginia.Then we come to Netgear, who, as countless people have observed, charge for support after 90 days. They are very, very efficient at processing support calls, with usually no hold times - of course not, they charge for those calls, which presumably discourages a large percentage of callers into hanging up immediately. They collect a ton of fees from the remaining callers, more than enough to pay for the efficient call centers. Heck - for what they charge for these support calls you could easily buy a brand new budget 'n' router.Netgear promised me if they could not solve my problem, they would refund my $39.99 single-incident support fee.Need I say Netgear could also not solve the problem? The had me try a half dozen things, none of which helped. But they would not refund my money. Every time I tried to get my money back, they connected me to an engineer who either went through the same steps with me again, or explained to me that since my Roku worked wirelessly, there must be nothing wrong with my router, and therefore it must be a Canon problem.Finally on 12/19/11 I reached a supervisor who agreed to a refund of the support fee. I was told his name was 'Kiruba,' but he identified himself as 'Mike.'On 1/9/12 as the refund had not come through, I called again. I was promised the refund would be coming, and that the refund department would contact me by both email and phone with 24-48 business hours.On 1/17/12 I called again - no refund had appeared and their refund department never contacted me. Now I was told, by 'Alexander,' that though he sees I was promised a refund, nothing was done to actually process it, so he would start the refund process and have the refund department contact me with 24-48 hours. He also said I could not have been promised they would contact me by phone and email, since they have no ability to call anyone and can only make contact by email.It is now 1/23/12. I have never heard from the refund department nor received a refund, and do not expect to ever hear from them or receive a refund.So, as I promised Netgear I would, I am making the story public here. And of course I will be initiating a credit card dispute.Beware of Netgear tech support. They don't try many different solutions, and can probably only help you solve the same simple problems you can find answers to on the web or in their user guide. Their most efficient skill is charging your credit card, and they are very good at promising refunds they never issue.By the way, on my own I eventually found a way to keep the wi-fi connection to the printer stable, but don't know if it's a good long term solution. If you want your Canon Wi-Fi printer to maintain its connection to this Netgear router, you have to disable the router QoS feature called WMM (Wi-Fi multimedia) on the 2.54 Ghz band that the Canon connects to. Once you do this, the Canon connection will be 100% stable indefinitely. Is there a bug in the Netgear implementation of WMM? Or a Canon bug? How should I know? Neither of these companies even suggested looking at this feature.WMM is presumably useful for things like streaming video and audio, and you'll find web pages that say 'never, ever turn it off.' Some pages will say 'if you turn it off, your 'n' router will drop down to 'g' speeds.' I haven't encountered any problems with it off, but don't feel good about disabling it, and wish there was more information published about this feature that consumers could understand. I may eventually revert to a wired LAN connection for my printer, so that I can safely re-enable the WMM feature.Don't expect to be able to use this router with a wi-fi printer - certainly not with a Canon printer. Not unless you are willing to take your chances on this WMM setting.I would advise everyone to buy a router from a company that offers free support at least while the router is in warranty. I know I will not be buying anything from Netgear in the future.EDIT: Netgear responded to my review below. I emailed them as they requested. They did not respond to my email. I gather they were unhappy about my review, but cannot actually do anything to assist me, technically or in terms of a refund of the fee - which is more or less what I've already observed about Netgear support. Perhaps the person responding meant well but ran into internal roadblocks, I don't know. My bank's credit card dispute resolution department resolved this in my favor.",,,

I figured after almost 10 years, they may have improved a bit. At first it seemed to work well. Signal and range were decent. Features were decent. I hooked it up in an environment of about 14 wireless devices (computers, ipads, etc). After about 3 weeks devices started randomly disconnecting from the network.  I wasn't sure it was the router until i noticed my devices showing up as 'Wired connections' when they were really wireless. If you can connect an iPad via a wired ethernet connection, lemme know, but that's what this thing said was happening. Tried multiple resets, firmware upgrades, etc. None of this solved the problem. I'd send it back for a replacement but Netgear's support has been difficult to get any kind of support from (Is your device plugged in?).To rule out interference from the neighbors or stray RF, I decided to get a comparable Cisco model.

I was experiencing issues with the WNDR3700v2 connecting to some of my devices  (the newer devices).  I tried everything even had the cable provider replace the cable modem (based on a suggestion from the Best Buy Geek Squad who supported one of my devices).  Called Netgear and because this is a refurbished model (BTW - with NO serial number - made me feel like I purchased it illegally or something) but because it's refurbhished I get NO - ZERO - phone support.  Eventually they did say I have 30 says of online support (which by the time I called was almost up).  But that entails sending emails back and forth (they'll answer in a day or so).  But ended up just being you send in an email they ask for more - you wait a day and they provide some suggestion - that you've already tried....finally I decided to reset to factory settings again and just set it up again - seems to be working.  So basically the support was useless and I had to figure it out on my own - NEVER BY A REFRUBISHED NETGEAR PRODUCT!!It seems to be working for the MOST part - although I've seen some drops of service only to be recovered a few seconds later.....lesson learned I'll NEVER BY A REFRUBISHED NETGEAR PRODUCT and my not be netgear again based on the support or lack of that I recieved.",,,

To my dismay i was told by net gear that I will have to pay to speak with someone, even though I knew that I needed a new unit! The person on the phone went over basic solutions ( resetting, unplugging, firmware ) All useless as I thought and my lost $35.I was told that a box will be send and they will fix it and send me another unit.

I setup a new wireless router from a different manufacurer and unlike what NetGear told me - there is NOT an issue with my PCs or home network.  It IS their piece of junk router that can't hold connections.  I paid $150 originally (Feb 2011) and $96 December 2011 for support that fixed absolutly nothing.  I should be able to get a refund for this defective item at the very least.  Unfortunately I can't get the many hours I spent frustrated troubleshooting, resting to factory defaults, and talking with NetGear's incompetent support back.

2979,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,1,1,20-Oct-11,A6GWEUEWJJU1T,Warranty worth less than monopoly money,"The device failed after 4 months of use. When I called Netgear, they said that my warranty expired (which isn't true) and that the only way to get support was to pay them $79 per year. After several phone calls and much arguing, someone agreed to help. I was then transferred to an incredibly incompetent 'technician' who made me change wireless settings when I clearly told him that the connection between my computer and the router is actually wired. After much back and forth, firmware upgrades, etc. he agreed to transfer me to a supervisor. We then went through the same process and the supervisor was clearly no more competent, so he transferred me to 'Level 1' support. I tell you, there are more layers of bureaucracy in this company then all third-world governments combined. And the problem is that every time the call is disconnected - which happens frequently - you have to renavigate that maze (i.e. argue again that you shouldn't need to pay $79 to have your warranty honored) in order to get to the same level you were at. Finally after about 6 hours on the phone somebody agreed to send me a replacement but I had to ship my router to them at my expense, which I did. Two weeks later they claimed to still have not received my shipment although it was actually delivered the next day. When I provided tracking details to the agent, they finally acknowledged receipt of my package, and shipped me a 'refurbished' router. To my horror, I discovered that the refurbished router was my own router and that it was not fixed in any way and still had the same problem! So back to square one with the sleazy salesperson trying to get me to pay $79 for support again. This time, with more experience under my belt, I managed to get to 'Level 1' support within about 3 hours. When they could not solve my problem, I was transferred to a 'Level 2' technician who also could not figure it out - although this was the first time I felt that the person on the other end knew anything about computer networking but still much less than needed - and suggested escalating to 'Level 3' support. I never got the privilege to speak with Level 3 but I got relayed instructions from them through my Level 2 technician which included things like 'try the router in another home instead', or 'send us proof that it's not working', or the worst one, 'sign the following confidentiality agreement before we are able to send you a software update that MAY solve your problem'. I didn't go for that because I had already tried the router somewhere else and used DD-WRT firmware which didn't work either so I knew it was not a software issue. I asked for a refund instead as it was clear the case was hopeless. I was told that someone from 'customer service' will call me back within a few hours to work with me on that. It's been 2 weeks and I still haven't heard back, even after calling them to check the status a couple of times. So basically the Netgear strategy seems to be:1- design unreliable products that often fail after a few months of use2- when they eventually break, make more money from the customer by charging them an arm and a leg for completely incompetent technical support3- whatever you do, don't let them get in touch with someone in the US or at least someone who is able to make a decision. Keep them lost between all the different levels of customer support while not acknowledging that their problem could be due to faulty hardware until they realize they've already wasted 13 hours dealing with you and remember that there are much better uses of their time.Finally, to paraphrase another reviewer, 'I would rather have several teeth pulled at the dentist's without pain relievers while having my leg amputated at the same time than having to deal with Netgear support'",,,

It connected easy and was up and running quickly, but the signal was poor, even with my laptop sitting just 4 feet from the router. my older WGR614 Netgear router preformed for years at an excellent signal up to 30 feet from the router and I had to change back to using it. The Netgear service tech tried and help we correct the signal issues with a firmware update and other tips. In the end the router never preformed up to the standards so I returned it.

But... my whole family soon noticed internet connections would randomly stall every 10 to 20 mins for about a minute which is long enough for internet pages time time out.  Very frustrating and lots of experiments, googling and reading message boards has not found an answer.  Netgear support did have a beta firmware patch but that also didn't work.I would try netgear support but judging from the feedback on this and other forums they know about this issue and just string folks along with non-answers.

I've had my first wireless router in 2003 and had upgraded to several brands of router past years.  Maybe I was lucky, all my routers Linksys, D-Link, Belkin, and Asus has survived 2+ years.  But not this one.  After 9 month of good service, it drops internet connection every couple of hours both wired and wireless connection.  First, I thought it was my cable modem but same problem occured after Time Warner changed modem to brand new one.  I am ready to give up after trying to fix this problem by flashing latest firmware and resetting router(30-30-30) several times.I realized that under the bad review, Netgear makes a comment saying email them netgear@amazon.com to fix the problem.  Well.. no words after 10 days.. I am 100% certain that this would be my last Netgear gadget I am gonna get.Correction:I did send the email to correct address: amazon@netgear.com.  I've resent the email I will post again if I get a proper response.",,,

Once running though, it worked great...for all of four months.  Now I'm past my warranty, they wanted to charge me to talk me through how I might be able to fix it, unless I purchased an extended warranty.  A quick search of the web (and the comments here) show that a decent percentage of these have a short life span, and Netgear seems to have figured out a way to profit from it.  Sell you a product that craps out after a few months, then charge you to even talk about fixing it. Nice try, I fell for it once, not again.  My new router will not be a Netgear product.",,,

Never had a drop off issue with the Linksys but have to often reconnect my Notebook PC to the Wireless and often loose internet access via wireless.  Router works GREAT hard wired but the wireless is very unreliable just like other reviews on here have warned.  Firmware is up to date but issues are consistent. I am not using the Wireless N to connect only Wireless G, but again never had an issue with the Linksys WRT54GS.  Also, I had much better range on wireless G on the Linksys than I do on this router.  Not been able to test the range using Wireless N yet.",,,
3043,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,2,2,25-Sep-11,ACSKLA997C60H,Useless Parts Warranty,"I purchased the WNDR3700 v1 nine months ago.  Although there were some challenges in the setup relating to using static IP addresses for my SBS network, it generally worked well for about six months.  I did not contact the free 3-month tech assistance because I knew that my network settings would befuddle the tech's script-driven process that assumes simple setups.Several months ago the internet (cable modem) would go out for a period of time.  I initially believed it was Comcast.  Recently it completely stopped and I was forced to do a thorough diagnostic routine.  I pin-pointed a faulty internet connection function of the WNDR3700, even though the rest of it worked as expected.  Swapping out my old/slower router confirmed the diagnosis.Netgear tech support refused to honor the 1-year parts warranty unless I purchased a $70 extension of the 'software' warranty to confirm that I had it configured correctly.  Explaining the above facts made no difference to them.  From their perspective: as long as the lights glow, then the hardware is working perfectly.  Summary: No warranty.I purchased a Belkin N750 DB for half the price of Netgear's current top-end gigabit wireless router.  The Belkin worked immediately and was easy to tweak.  I will also hold onto my 5-year old Belkin F5D8230 as a reliable backup (albeit slower wireless).Bottom line: the Netgear is fine as long as it works, but do not rely on their warranty because of the mandatory 'software' warranty before they will honor the 'hardware' warranty.",,,
3050,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,1,1,23-Sep-11,A33GRQF05W1MVT,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"DO NOT BUY FROM NETGEAR! Horrible customer service - worse than horrible!  This router worked fine for about 4 months.  Then it died suddenly.  After checking out settings, etc., I was pretty certain that the problem was with the hardware.  Called customer service only to find that they only will offer free support for 3 months, though the hardware is warranteed for 1 year.  But they wouldn't even speak to me about the hardware issue until I paid the $100 support fee. And they kept telling me that since the lights were on that it couldnt' be a hardware issue.  So I paid the $100.  Then the nightmare started.  I ended up having to call them about 30 times over the course of a month. The technicians knew less than I do about computers, and they didn't have me do anything that I hadn't already done (except spend a lot of time reinstalling and rebooting). I swear I almost had a heart attack dealing with them.  They barely speak English, transfer you a million times, don't follow through on what they say, etc.  Even worse, they won't look at or don't keep a record of previous transactions, so every time you call or are transferred, you have to tell your entire story all over again.  I have never been rude to customer service people over the phone before, but I ended up screaming and swearing at these people.  Even when they said they would replace the router, they would not send me the information I needed to actually get it without many more phone calls.  Then, I told them I wanted my support fee refunded since it was a hardware issue and under warranty.  That was a million more phone calls, and still it appeared on my credit card report.  So back to the phone and explaining everything from the beginning since they refuse to read the records.  Maddening.  I pray that this one doesn't break, but if it does, I will throw it out and buy another brand.  Oh, and the ability to use the second frequency is pretty useless since there are few devices out there that support it.  Stay away from this Netgear product and any other!",,,
3051,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,1,1,22-Sep-11,A1GFIU8RI1QAEL,DO NOT BUY.  Warranty is worthless. Tech Support costs more than the router.,"I purchased this router because I have a large house and needed something with good range.  It did an OK job reaching the other end of the house, and when functioning properly, transmission speed is adequate.  My real complaint, however, is with warranty/customer support.  After about six months, the router started dropping the internet connection at random intervals, sometimes for just a few seconds, sometimes for a couple of minutes.  So, I called tech support to see if anything could be done.  However, I was told that even though the warranty is supposed to be good for one year, it only covers the hardware, and this was a software problem.  How did they know it wasn't a hardware problem?  Because the lights still turned on!  If I wanted tech support, I was invited to purchase one year of it--at a cost about equal to the original purchase price of the router.  If I preferred, I could purchase 30 minutes of support for 'only' $39.99.I have also discovered that this is a known issue with these modems, which makes it even harder to believe that it's a software rather than a hardware problem.  So, bottom line: it's a decent enough router as long as it keeps working for you, but you are SOL if something goes wrong and you are outside the 90-day technical support window.",,,
3066,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,3,4,20-Jan-14,AWP7ZFW63R4K6,Terrible router,"I have given this router more than a fair shot. I will start with some background information. I am a MAC user and live at an apartment building in a major city. A 5G connection is almost a must to block out all of the other competing connections from other renters. I purchased this router because of it's duel band capabilities and relatively fair price for use.So, the first router I received was in September of 2013. It worked great for a week then, on a weekly basis, it would constantly drop the connection and require a manual restart. After two weeks, it would then begin to drop the connection on a 3-4 day basis, then every other day and all the way down to a connection drop every day (this was over the course of about a month and a half). Netgear tech support tried repeatedly to fix it (and were great, the only redeeming quality here), however they were unable to diagnose the issue. Tech support actually suggested that I exchange it for a new one (since they have a 1 year warranty) and send the original router back as 'defective'. I did that and Amazon did a great job doing the exchange for me.Now, the second router. The second router seemed to be a fix. For the next two months I had maybe one restart issue (which is common). At the turn of the new year, however, I experienced a restart( okay, no big issue) That being said, I am now, just before I wrote this, on my third restart this month at what appears to be a once a week to once every four days schedule. I am falling back into the same routine I was on with the original. Also, the firmware upgrade did nothing. It seems as if the router itself just degrades in its ability to carry signal over a hastened period of time. I've never experienced anything like this with an electronic device.That all being said, i will continue to use this router and most likely exchange it for another one until I get out of the warranty window (that's my way of at least getting my $80 worth out of this stupid thing). Once I move on to a new router, I will probably never buy another Netgear product again. Given how many they make and sell, the chances of me getting two lemons in a row should be incredibly rare. This reflects a massive quality and control issues at Netgear. I would highly recommend another router, especially if you're willing to spend anywhere from $60-$100.Additional note: My ISP and modem are fine. I originally thought they might be the problem but had them checked multiple times. Additionally, whenever I would restart the router my internet would come right back on after the restart, this means the issue is at the router and not one of the modem or ISP.",,,

I've experienced everything from dropped WiFi every 5 or so minutes on one unit to complete failure of the wired hub on it's replacement.  Pure junk, plain and simple.  I've used Belkin and Linksys prior to this Netgear and have to say, I'll never buy another one.

No new firmware available and I'm not wasting my time with Netgear netfools on the phone.

3125,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,1,1,9-Sep-11,A282510SKXSKUR,AVOID NETGEAR!!,"RECENT UPDATE (Nov. 2011): Read initial review (below) to see the positive aspects of this router. AVOID NETGEAR!!! It has been 3 months since I purchased this router. Two weeks ago I noticed that the router would randomly drop the signals on both channels, so I called tech support. The Netgear representative said my product was no longer under warranty since it was 96 days old, i.e. the 'warranty' expired 6 DAYS AGO! To make a long story short, the representative very rudely explained that I need to PURCHASE a Netgear Warranty and that talking to a supervisor would not make difference. It is almost unbelievable that this router appears to be failing at the 90-day warranty period! I guess I should have called 6 days sooner?Initial, positive review (August 2011):This router is incredibly fast, it almost feels like it is plugged into the ethernet port. I have owned several Linksys routers over the years (all failed at 2-3 years of use) and I think this router runs circles around any Linksys product. My last Linksys N-router seemed only a little faster than the previous G-router I owned, but this Netgear N-router is much, much faster. The signal is strong and stable in both the 2.4GHz & 5GHz frequencies (no failures yet). My old Linksys had a weaker signal that occasionally dropped since the first day I owned it(especially if the microwave oven was on two rooms away?). Based on my experience so far, I cannot imagine ever buying another Linksys product again.The are a couple problems with the Netgear router: (1) the set-up is terrible since it is very slow and you have no idea what is happening (no progress bar or anything); (2) no instruction manual (the digital version that comes with the CD requires a lengthy boot-up); and (3) it is VERY difficult to locate a Netgear customer support phone number anywhere (I did not see anything on the box or the very few papers that came with the router), even online--this is a serious problem that needs to be corrected ASAP.",,,

I was then told to update the firmware from a friends computer and then try again.  This also did not work.  I have read the forums and see the same problem by others.

3155,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,0,0,30-Aug-11,A1LK22STNGPXOI,OK if you don't need a wireless connection,"In some ways, this wireless router works as you might expect. It has most of the features you could want, has an adequate management interface, and some useful though primitive usage reporting. It was easy to set up and get devices connected.Where this device falls down is reliability. After a month of usage, the router decides that, every evening at some point, it would no longer connect any wireless devices. When the wireless connectivity drops out, no wireless devices will connect to it our even see the connection in the list of those available. The only way to get the connectivity back is cycle the power on the router. After a week, this was no longer fun, and neither was trying to deal with Netgear's tech support. I have a low tolerance for bad customer service, and after half an hour on the phone with no results, I put the router in it's new home (recycle bin) and got something else. The new router, an Asus RT-N56U, is fabulous. No dropped wireless, faster than the Netgear (even when it was working), and has, hands-down, the best router management UI of any router I've had (and there have been quite a few). And it's about the same price as the Netgear.This is my second Netgear device (also had a gigabit switch of theirs for about 20 minutes), both of which have failed to work properly.

Verizon refuses to send me an 'N' band router, stating that the current router works fine. I decided to purchase an N600 due to reading reviews indicating an increased coverage area. After using the install CD it would not work. I spoke to a support agent for over 2 hours and she could not get it going. She informed me that a senior engineer would call me the next day. After waiting from 7am to 2pm with no call, I called them back. The agent refused to transfer me to a senior engineer, attempting to assist me herself. After insisting to be transferred to the senior, I was put on hold and disconnected. I was not called back by Netgear. I called back and reached a lady that barely spoke English. She eventually transferred me to the senior engineer. I spent over 2 MORE hours on the phone with the engineer, was put on hold and disconnected. When the support call was initated the agent asked me for my phone number 'in case we are disconnected'. I was disconnected at around 4pm on Tuesday 8-16. It is now 4:15pm on 8-17 and I'm still waiting for a callback. It is quite obvious that if the agent runs out of options they simply disconnect the caller and move on. The router was returned for a refund today. I will not purchase Netgear products in the future. BTW I own (5) PC's. This is another indication of the poor customer service practices so prevalent today in the USA.**** Part 2 **** I sent an email to the Amazon/Netgear address and provided Netgear with the appropriate case and customer numbers.

3208,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,2,3,11-Aug-11,A1H4PB8FFEEAV,Great Router - Awful Support,"I have two of these routers. One of the v1's and one of the v2's. The v1 is setup as a master base station while the v2 is setup as a repeater.Both routers perform beautifully. The product is sound. Please note that the 'auto-firmware check' does not detect the latest firmware. You will need to go to netgear.com and put your model number in to download the latest firmware. I give the router itself 5 stars. Note that the advertised range is not quite there. Especially in the 5Ghz band in my experience.The reason for 1 star:I dont think I have ever dealt with worse customer support in my life. These guys make Dell look like a 2011 lamborghini vs a 79' pinto. I called Netgear support because I was trying to setup a repeater for both the 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz bands (Note: this is NOT supported. You can only use a repeater for one band or the other). When you call support they make you wade through a rediculous number of menus, and then when you finally reach the menu you need (i.e. techsupport), they force to hang and up and call a differnt number! That is gripe 1. Next, I hung up and called the second number and had to hold almost 20min to get a human. Once I got a human it was obvious I was speaking to some outsourced contractor in India. I had to give the guy just about everything except my blood type before he would even listen to my problem. Thats gripe 2. Next, I explained my problem about trying to setup a repeater for dual bands. It took me about 10 mins to clearly exaplin the problem. He said he understood and asked me if I could hold for a moment. I said 'yes, I'll hold'. I was then transferred without warning to some other tech (again, obviously indian contractor). He asked what my problem was. I said, 'didnt the guy I was just talking to for 45 mins tell you anything?!'. He said 'no'. So I had to go through the same process of giving him all the information about me, the serial numbers, model numbers, firmware version, phone number, blah blah - Again! Thats gripe 3. Finally I spend another 15 mins or so explaining the problem and now he asks me if I can hold a moment. So, I reluctantly said 'sure, I'll hold'. So, I am tranferred somewhere else, the phone rings and rings, and then the call disconnects. Almost 90 mins on the phone with support and the most information I got from them was 'please hold' and I was hung up on. I tried calling back twice, and it was the same thing. They just kept transferring me. Thats the final gripe. So, I will not be buying a Netgear product again for the rest of my life.Anyhow, if you have problems, be prepared to resolve it on your own! Netgear support is worse than Dell! I repeat, worse than Dell!Good Luck-----M-------",,,
3228,XX,B002HWRJY4,1,1,1,4-Aug-11,A4BJ4USDEE2NB,Could be a great router if the firmware worked properly,"This review is about the Netgear N600 (WNDR3700) router: http://www.amazon.com/Netgear-Wireless-Gigabit-Router-WNDR3700/dp/B002HWRJY4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1312438873&sr=8-1After having no problems for about 6months, I upgraded router's firmware to the latest firmware (1.0.6.98) to hopefully some well known issues with the USB drive - but the upgrade resulted in my laptop dropping the connection about every five minutes (it was working fine prior to the upgrade -v 1.04.68). After going through the Netgear forums and finding the same firmware problem was happening to several owners of the same router, I backed out of the upgrade and installed the prior version (1.0.4.68), but the intermittent connectivity still remained.I called Netgear and the technician asked me to do a ping test between a wired host and router to determine if the intermittent connectivity I was experiencing on the wireless was a router hardware problem. The ping was successful (5 pkts, 0% loss), so he deemed the router to be ok. Since I was past the firmware warranty (the what?), he said that was all he could do unless I paid $60 for a software/firmware support contract because the software is only convered for 6 months after you purchase the router.  If I paid for the support I he would help me fix the problem. Hmmm, you would think the software support would last as long as the hardware (1 year). I double checked with a supervisor and she confirmed they would only help with firmware for 6 months.This is a first for the industry as far as I know. If you effectively brick your router after following the vendor's instructions to upgrade to their software and they will not help you unless you pay 50% of the router's original cost for 6 months of software support - they do not need my business. I went to them on a friend's recommendation - I'd been using Linksys/Cisco for years. Too Bad.I will go back to Linksys or try one of the new ASUS black diamonds mentioned in the Netgear forums - where members were leaving behind their Netgear WNDR3700's. More research on my part would have shown that performance was better with the other two as well - my bad.Asus: http://www.amazon.com/Processor-Hardware-Internal-Antennas-RT-N56U/dp/B0049YQVHE/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1312439062&sr=1-1Cisco : http://www.amazon.com/Cisco-Linksys-E4200-Performance-Simultaneous-Wireless-N/dp/B004K1EZDS/ref=sr_1_4?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1312439062&sr=1-4I peeked at the Netgear 40000, but can't get past the short and costly support policy.So, I would encourage potential buyers to compare the Netgear warranty and router with other vendors before buying. -Steve",,,

Never really disconnects but slows way down to a crawl until I reboot. Worked ok for the first two days now this. Also I sent an email to amazon@netgear.com and NEVER heard a word! It sounds like YOU want to help but the rest of your team is lacking in communication and designing the right firmware.So I'm still telling everybody, DON'T BUY THIS ROUTER!!!!!!!!!!!",,,

While the router was very easy to install, it has proven to be highly unreliable with frequent losses of connectivity (occurring about once every 10 minutes) and webpage download delays. Our primary reason for wanting to get this router was its alleged high speed and performance, neither of which has proven to be valid: the 5-GHz antenna has very low signal strength as compared with the 2.4 GHz band making it unusable and the 802.11n capability is non-existent.We will be returning this router for a refund and have resumed using our older and far more reliable Linksys WRT54GL router.",,,

I install, build and maintain my equipment not only for my home but commercially since the 80's. I know what I am doing. This piece of junk arrived and right out of the box started having connect problems and shut downs. I spent a few hours trying to stop this thing from shutting down. Searching the web for an answer, I read a firmware update corrected some of the problems (why did I get one with known problems?) I am tired of manufactures sending out faulty products and having the consumer spend hours on the phone with reps from another country who can't speak english very well and even less knowledge about the product, trying to fix it. During the attempt of updating the firmware it shut down again, guess that froze up the router for sure. At that point it went back in the box and was returned.

While the router was easy to setup and provides decent connection speeds when actually working, it periodically drops wifi connectivity on the 5ghz band for no apparent reason.I have two laptops connected to this router on the 5ghz band and each experiences the same problem. I have to reset the wireless connection on each computer in order to reestablish wireless communication with the router. The issues surfaced not long after I first setup the router -straight out of the box- and despite two subsequent firmware updates (1.0.0.08 and 1.0.0.10) and resets, the issue persists. I believe firmware version 1.0.0.10 was released specifically to address this issue but it hasn't worked for me and many other customers.I'm extremely disappointed by Netgear and this product. Given its relative cost and the positive reviews here, I expected a quality product. Instead, I got a router that is worse than the 5 year old router it replaced. At least that one worked reliably, albeit providing a slow connection.While Netgear appears to have tacitly acknowledge the issue on their customer support message boards, as well as released new firmware, it hasn't fixed the problem.Don't spend good money on a faulty product.",,,

About nine months later that's when things started to get messy.  I've used Netgear products in the past, I tried to be level headed and optimistic with the device.  The issues I've have now is.* Without any changes to my setup, my router decides that the 2.4g wireless will now sporatically connect.  Sometimes it doesn't even want to connect to any machine.* Listening to the Netgear help number sends you to the pay money to get help number.* Describing the issue on Netgear was useless, since once I hit 'submit' a fatal error on their form occured.* I've asked their Netgear forum and have yet to hear back from any of their tech peopleI've tried many...many time to debug the device.

The hard wired connections are great, very fast and always work.  However the main reason I bought this is for wireless.  Which I've had problems with it turning off byu itself randomlt.

Plus if I got it back and it happened again I would have to pay again.  I sat on tech support for over 2 hours and they finally fixed it only for it to go out again the next day.  I call back and they said a new firmware came out that was supposed to fix this very problem.  So I download it and it fixed the problem for 3 days.  Now my lights on my router say both wireless connections are working and on but nothing can even see the SSID from the router even though its set to display the SSID.

Although the connection was flaky, the range and speed were reasonbly decent.  Then suddenly, the 2.4 GH transmitter stopped working (to be completely accurate, it did not go away entirely, but the transmission power dropped so low that you have to stand right next to the router to detect it at all).  I had not made any changes to the router - it simply suddenly dropped away to almost nothing.After extensinve troubleshooting, I called customer support.  Oh, the router is more than 90 days old? No, we can't help you then. I was given another number and told that I had to call that number for warranty support. I called the number and the lies began.  They told me that my 90 days of free support had expired (the only true thing they ever said) and that I needed to pay 69 dollars for six months of 'gearhead' support.  I told them that I didn't need support - I needed a replacement router (the router is still well within the warranty period).  Oh, no, they told me, there can't be a hardware problem.  The reason?  The lights on the front of the router are lit (apparently they're magic LEDs) That means it must be a configuration problem.  And they can fix it in minutes, if I just pay them first. When I refused to pay them to honor their warranty, they refused to help.  Over the span of multiple calls over the next several days, nothing changed.  They lied. (promising to call back on multiple occasions which never happened, for example)  They made outrageous claims:  I hadn't secured it properly (despite having set it to use WPA2 encryption). No details were given, just insinuations that somehow magical hackers had caused my signal to disappear.  They woudn't explain, of course, as to how this was happening (details would cost me a support contract), just angry retorts telling me about their many years of experience and their incredulity that I was daring to question their expertise. And that's just the highlights of many hours of frustration.The bottom line is this: Netgear appears to have decided that the only thing that matters to them is selling support contracts, no matter how many lies they have to tell and promises they have to break and that their warranty is meaningless.  If you buy one of their products, you'd better hope it doesn't break.",,,

Tech Support worked with me for nearly two hours, when it was determined that no amount of resetting/rebooting was going to fix the problem.  OK, I can get a replacement.  Hold on, I have to pay shipping back to Netgear - with delivery confirmation, amounting to most of $10.00, additionally, I have no router until they receive my return and ship the replacement to me.

I guess I can voice my discontent on the forums here so the Netgear engineers and prospective customers can see what is going on. This is the question... why do you need to spend $150 for a router that will continue to have bad firmware updates? Every single firmware update for the WNDR3700 series router has been a complete flop, incapable of doing what is advertised.I bought the WNDR3700v1 when it first came out because it was going to be the best of the best. Other than the occasional lockups, it worked great. Hardly any problems until these bad firmware updates started coming out. Here is my history:31 Stock FirmwareWorked great as advertised but would have occasional lockups.49 ReleaseLocked up daily and cut network throughput to a quarter. Went back to 31.55 ReleaseNetwork throughput cut back to a quarter again. Didn't lock up on me but the web GUI was unreachable until a reboot. Back to stock 31.68 ReleaseWhat a joke! Throughput went up but gaming and other items would boot you off after 10-30 minutes. Back to stock 31 again.75 ReleaseWow, pretty stable... if you like the throughput to be cut in half. Another waste in time. Back to stock 31.98 ReleaseI was shortly amazed for at least a week. Throughput was good but after that week my VoIP phone dropped after 15 minutes on every call and multiple devices online at the same time were slow slow slow. The range went down too. QoS was a joke. I guess 30 feet through a ceiling was too much for this top of the line equipment to handle. Back to stock 31.Now, I have seen some tricks to clear the NAND and 30-30-30 and none of them have worked. The only firmware that [U][B]EVER[/B][/U] worked right on this router is the stock 31 firmware. I don't use the USB drive access, traffic meter, logs, or any of that stuff and the firmware releases still fail miserably.If you are a consumer and want this router to function as it should, do not bother with any firmware other than [B]1.0.4.31[/B]. Downgrade it to 31 at the first sign of any trouble. We are talking about radio here, it's been around a long time. I just can't believe ever release sucks so bad :mad:.The entire staff of Netgear firmware engineers should be fired. I will never buy a Netgear product again because your company has ruined my confidence. Do they even test this stuff before they release it? Why do they release firmware and immediately pull it off the server? Is this outfit a joke or what?  It's like every update makes this router even worst. Do you have a bunch of engineers in a room saying stuff like, 'what can we do to make our product even worst... ah, this should be funny.'Don't worry. I know a company doesn't like bad PR and this will probably be removed shortly. No worries, I will post this as a review on your seller web sites.

122,XX,B002HWRJY4,2,1,1,17-Apr-11,A3F9ZSAYLIUPPC,Nice looking but..... Horrible Reliability,"I had a setup in my home with a 2 Linksys WRT54G's (these are 2.4GHz Wireless-G routers) - one upstairs and one downstairs. I had switched both of these to the Tomato firmware which has significantly more features and allows WRT54G's to be setup in WDS mode. WDS mode basically allows the wireless network to be expanded (i.e. increased range) by using multiple access points. The setup has worked wonderfully for the last 4 years - with perhaps one reboot of the routers every six months.With a growing stable of wireless and wired devices (Desktop PCs, laptops, Mobile phones, iPads, PS3, BluRay players ...) I figured it was time to upgrade to a wireless router that would support both G and N, and also includes Gigabit wired switch. Looked at various reviews here in Amazon and finally settled on the Netgear WNDR3700v2 based on it's simultaneous dual Band (2.4 and 5 GHz)capability, higher range of the channels, and the Gigabit wired switch. Bought it at Fry's Electronics since it was cheaper there.Setup of the device was quick, as it should be. The device automatically detected that there was a newer version of firmware available when it first booted up. Download and installation was uneventful. Completed the setup of both the bands and had the various devices connecting to it in about 30 minutes - quite reasonable. The range of the 2.4 Ghz band was higher than the 5.0 Ghz, but not as large as the 2 Linksys I originally had. However the range for sufficient for my needs - don't work from my backyard that much :).  Overall I was happy. The device worked quite well for the first 3 hours and that is when the problems first started. My son told me that his laptop (which was originally connected on the 2.4 Ghz channel) was no longer detecting the channel. Sure enough, none of the devices could. So rebooted the router and things were back to normal. However, another few hours and the problem resurfaced. This time, I downgraded the firmware to the previous version hoping that would fix this problem. Well, it didn't. Over the next week, the router has to be reset (mainly because the 2.4 Ghz channel gives up) every few hours. Longest it ran without a reboot was 14 hours. Researched whether others were having this issue and YES, it seems like a lot of others have similar problems. So, that settled it -- I didn't get a lemon, this seems like a systemic issue with this router. Not sure how a company can release a product that cannot do it's primary function for more than a few hours. Anyways, returned the device to Fry's and switched back to my old setup. No more complaints from the wife and kids.  Here's the summary of my experience: THE GOOD:  -- Looks great. It really does.  -- The range of the bands is pretty decent.  -- Setup is easy.  -- Gigabit ports work as advertised. Helped a lot with the wired connections (Have a NAS drive with photos and Videos)  -- Didn't test the throughput of the wireless bands but didn't see anything slow down when they were working THE BAD  -- The data monitor built into the device is pretty useless. THE UGLY  -- Extremely unreliable. Has to be reset every few hours because the 2.4 Ghz channel quites broadcasting. Shame on Netgear for releasing such an unreliable product.  My recommendation is to stay away from this device. However, if you are tempted to try it out, buy it from your neighborhood store (Fry's will match any local or internet price, Walmart has the cheapest price for this) so that you can return it easily if you end up experiencing problems similar to the ones I encountered.",,,

I rebooted it, everything worked again for a few hours. It locked up again. I decided to try the latest firmware (1.0.0.8) to see if that would stop the freezes. Things got worse. Everything slowed to a crawl. I went back to the older firmware (1.0.0.6), but no luck. The 2.4Ghz ssid came back, but not the 5Ghz.I don't know if it burned out after a day or what.

After installing the latest firmware, this router worked for 2 weeks before my remote extensions all went dead on me (failed to come through the router and register), while internet connection (both LAN & WLAN) was still intact.  After messing around its settings for 2 days to no vail, I came back Amazon to read more reviews and to my surprise, I found several others sharing the similar frustration.  I immediately took one of the reviewers' recommendation and bought a Linksys E3000 so I could try it out side by side with Netgear to confirm it's indeed a hardware failure.  Waited 5 days, E3000 came to my door.  After 15 minutes of programing the same settings into E3000, my remote extensions were back on line.I noticed the advanced features are much richer and the web GUI is more sophisticated with a lot more control over sharing contents locally and/or remotely.  On top of it, my wife immediately noticed the web surfing speed was better than Netgear's.To sum up, if you only use it for basic wireless networking and internet gateway, it does the job fine, but anything beyond this point, Linksys E3000 wins hands down.  If you are in the similar situation, don't even bother calling the Netgear tech support, which I did (wasted at least 20 hours of my time spread across a week), as it's the product that has the problem, not you.",,,

I purchased the WNDR3700v2 to replace a WNDR2000 which was operating fine, I was just ready for an upgrade.After opening and setting up the new router, it seemed to be working well. Immediately out of the box there was a firmware update. After about a day of use, however, the wireless dropped and none of my devices could find the SSID. Being a new product, I figured the router just needed to be reboot and everything would work fine. After a reboot, things worked fine again for a while and suddenly, the problem repeated itself - wireless dropped and SSID missing (though the indicator light for wireless broadcast was illuminated).This being my 4th or 5th Netgear router, I am familiar enough with their router management software to have attempted to tweak some settings (security, broadcast, and otherwise) to attempt to resolve the issue but was unable to successfully keep my router transmitting a wireless signal. Figuring it was a faulty device, I returned the item to amazon and got a replacement. Sadly, the replacement item had the same issue. After three days with the replacement product and several more troubleshooting trials, I opted to return the item to Amazon for a refund. I'm just going back to my WNDR2000.A couple of things to note:1) I think this router, if it worked properly, would be fantastic. With gigabit connection ability several advanced features, it is clearly the beginning of a new generation of routers. I'm not sure why the two routers I received did not work - but if I knew the problem would be resolved, I'd gladly purchase it again.2) While the 5 Ghz wireless signal is a nice option, of my 10+ wireless capable devices, only one is capable of finding and utilizing 5 Ghz. If you are buying this router for the dual-band option, I'd suggest you make sure your devices are capable of taking advantage of this feature and, if not, a different router (that is less expensive) may be a better option. In the future, I'm sure 5 Ghz will be more utilized but until then, it's far from 'must-have' selling point.",,,

They only want to sell me more phone support, instead of offer me an RMA. It is under hardware warranty until October 2011 :/Please spare yourselves the headache of dealing with support and just buy a different brand router.Only pro's would be that when it worked it sent out the wireless signal a lot farther then some of the linksys routers that I have used.

When I first got it going it was fantastic!It streamed to all my computers and other internet connected devices with reliable high speed.The ONLY problem, and this was a show stopper, was I had to reset it every so often. Sometimes it was good for a few days, other times I'd have to unplug and plug back in in under 12 hours.I wouldn't mind the reset so much if only it WOULD reset after I unplugged and plugged back in.Sometimes it took SEVERAL times before it would finally get back to transmitting -- very frustrating.I've used an Airport Extreme (from Apple) for a number of years, but it doesn't have the range that I need in my newer, larger home. That NEVER needed to be reset, but again, the range was insufficient.I'm going to try Medialink's solution (ordered on Amazon yesterday) -- it has the highest ratings of any router I could find on Amazon - fingers crossed.(full disclosure: I bought the Netgear N600 at my local Best Buy, not on Amazon).",,,

Setting it up was pretty easy even with both this and my old router on the same network.  Wired performance is fine, same with wireless, though I didn't exhaustively test either of these.The biggest problem for me was it made basic surfing painful.  Every few minutes all connections/page loads would simply timeout for about a minute until the router woke itself up again.  I figured I could put DD-WRT on it instead of Netgear's FW but this version of the hardware isn't yet supported.If you have no interest in loading custom firmware then stay away from this unit for now.  If you do have interest, make sure that your firmware of choice has support for this newer version (FCC ID is PY308300092).",,,

It got worse when we tried to bring in the laptop as part of the network and became a nightmare when we tried to resolve the issue of why the laptop couldn't print through the router/wirelessly.  We had to terminate our conversations with tech support after being transferred four times and being reprimanded for not calling on the correct line.  Finally we gave up and tried to get the answer on the Netgear online forum - more stress in getting the unfriendly website to acknowledge our registration and let us logon.  It seemed there was no answer although a lot of people seemed to have the same problem.  In desparation, we turned to HP product support since the printer was theirs.  Lo and behold.  A very competent, user friendly service rep diagnosed the problem through a remote session as a missing ethernet cable. Fixed!  Bottom line: stay away from Netgear unless you have unlimited time, are a computer techie and or speak multiple languages.",,,

Feature set is average.Not to go off on a rant here, but why does every network mfr. make these routers and only crappy usb adapters to go with them?Anyway, the thing paired well... but the router is on the 1st floor of my house and my bedroom is on the 3rd.  I was getting 1MB/s transfers tops, even when the router showed I  had 4 bars and 135mbit connection.

This router checked all of the boxes that I wanted- dual band, dlna, usb for a hard drive and great performance.  Setup was very easy (if you've ever set up a router before, this one is pretty self-explanatory).  Range was excellent, even on 5ghz.  There were several problems.  If I was using a lot of bandwidth downloading a file, the other radio had a tendency to turn off (if I was downloading on the 5ghz band, both of the radios for 2.4 would turn off and drop their connections to other devices).  I would also intermittently lose my connection to the internet, causing frequent timeouts.

258,XX,B002HWRJY4,2,2,3,8-Jan-11,A7PV5S05T5DUM,"Died after 16 hours, and it gets worse","The package arrived. I unboxed my new  NETGEAR wndr3700 and spent over an hour setting it up. About 45 minutes too long in my opinion. Sixteen hours later it is dead, kaput, bricked! After 30 minutes on the phone with NETGEAR, I learned that during the first 30 days they don't accept warranty replacements from Amazon customers. The reason, according to the NETGEAR representative, is that Amazon packages refurbished products as new. If I'd purchased the router from Best Buy, NETGEAR would have happily replaced it. But after I completed Amazon's truly painless return process, I guess I'm happy NETGEAR didn't want it back. I expect NETGEAR would have kept me on the phone for another 30 minutes to complete the return paperwork.If you're still considering a purchase, these are my impressions after briefly owning the wndr3700. This router is much more complicated to configure than the Apple AirPort it replaced. (The AirPort recently began to drop connections after eight years of solid service. I became tired of power cycling it every few days.)The NETGEAR also has limitations that the Apple base station did not. The NETGEAR must be connected to a cable/DSL modem or a gateway router. It will not work otherwise. I had the AirPort hanging off an 8-port switch in the den which was connected to the gateway router downstairs. The NETGEAR wouldn't even respond until I swapped it for the switch. Also, the NETGEAR didn't work correctly when I turned off DHCP which I expected to be handled by the gateway router. It was only happy when it also provided DHCP. On the other hand, the NETGEAR router has a huge feature set. But making use of the advanced ones is not something the average computer user will want or need to attempt. In the very brief time it worked the wi-fi range was excellent and the throughput seemed good; I never had a chance to try streaming video or anything else that would tax the connection.Updated - I can't believe I'm back updating this review. I received a replacement for the defective router from Amazon. To my surprise, the item was not new. It was an open box return. There was no tape or wrapping holding the router box closed. In fact, the plastic wrapping was stuffed inside the box along with the cling film that protects the router from scratches. The power adapter was unwrapped and missing its twist tie. The factory tape sealing the router in its plastic bag was unsealed. Finally, the included ethernet cable was missing. Even if I'd not unboxed a new unit a week earlier, it would have been obvious that this router was not packed at the factory.This time I called Amazon customer service instead of using the web site. I explained the the condition of the clearly not new item to the courteous CSR who agreed to send me another router. He then put me on hold while he looked into why I'd received an open box item. Five minutes later, he was back on the line saying that the warehouse told him the unpacking must have happened during shipping. I opined that it was unlikely the UPS driver had unboxed the router to test it in the truck. Maybe the state-side warehouse crew thinks it very funny to pawn off crazy excuses on the gullible India CSR staff? Either that or they need to write down more believable stories in their call scripts.So now I'm wait for another router to arrive. Maybe the third time will be the charm.",,,
279,XX,B002HWRJY4,2,2,3,24-Dec-10,AGFUJAPEIOEXR,First Version is Disappointing,"The wired networking element of this router is five stars.  It's a 680 MHz processor with gigabit ethernet ports; this thing hauls and when dealing with wired networking, performs as well or slightly better than some of the Cisco SOHO products I've used.  But that's only part of why you buy a wireless router.If your TA number is V17 or less, don't buy this router.  Don't even open it because the range on this thing will surely disappoint.  Not only that, but the throughput is just horrible, and that's on the 2.4 GHz radio.  The 5 GHz radio is next to worthless.The web interface is still typical Netgear klunky.  It works, but it's not particularly intuitive nor elegant.  It's annoying that in this day and age that only one login at a time is permitted.  There is no syslog to an external server, which I like to do in order to keep the logs off the router.  But port forwarding, dynamic DNS are all supported. The DHCP server works well, but DHCP reservation is a bit strange in that you can only reserve addresses out of the DHCP lease pool range. Not exactly a deal breaker, but it is one of those little 'gotchas' that make you wonder what they were thinking.This router is supported by DD-WRT.  However, the current version (v24-sp2 12/18/10) is so buggy that I can't recommend it.  If you load that firmware, your wireless throughput will drop even further, and many of the functions like creating secondary ethernet bridges will completely cause the WAN to quit working.  Just stay away from it (the forums on DD-WRT will confirm this).So, should you consider this router?  Only if you are able to purchase a later version unit which hopefully has corrected the wirless issue.  Everything about this box is fast, but for the price paid it should be simply flawless.  And it isn't anywhere near flawless.  Netgear should be issuing refunds to customers who bought V15-V17 units.",,,

332,XX,B002HWRJY4,2,1,2,8-Dec-10,A9CY0IYTTP1VT,"Better Signal, Worse Throughput","I bought this router to form a wireless bridge between a netgear WNR3500L and this unit. While I was able to get the bridge to work without too many annoyances, the transfer rate between units was very poor (generally less than or around 1 MB/s). I also attempted to pair this with a wireless N adapter to connect a machine in the same remote room. I was totally unable to get this to cooperate with a the dlink extreme wireless N PCI express adapter. They would connect, but every single data packet was lost. By contrast, with the WNR3500L acting as my master router, the dlink wireless N card functioned okay with a average throughput around 3.5 MB/s. Signal strength was an issue for the WNR3500L. I generally got around 75% signal strength with that unit, whereas the WNDR3700 did achieve a signal strength into the room around 95% (it just did not get along with the dlink adapter). I cannot advise using this unit to form a wireless bridge. It might work fine if paired with a different wireless N adapter. On a side note, I bought a second WNR3500L in order or form a wireless bridge and found the performance similar to pairing the WNDR3700 with a WNR3500L.",,,
344,XX,B002HWRJY4,2,0,0,26-Nov-10,A2EMVVXUOXBGVE,Needed frequent rebooting,"I bought this to replace an old Belkin 'Pre-N' router that I bought in 2004. The Belkin still works but I wanted some newer features like simultaneous 802.11a, UPnP. Manual setup was easy using its decent Web interface; I didn't use the installation CD. Its range was very good - about the same as the old Belkin Pre-N router (which has always had very good range) on the 2.4-GHz band. (The 5-GHz range was less than the 2.4-GHz range, as expected. This is normal for the 5-GHz band.) Data throughput was very good, both on Ethernet and WiFi - much better than the old Belkin, which seemed to bog down at times. I used the built-in utility to check the firmware and it told me that I already had the latest. So far, so good.Well, after a couple of days, one of my WiFi-connected computers would no longer connect to the router. Examined both the PC and the router - both were still set up correctly. Rebooting the PC did nothing. Rebooting the Netgear router fixed the problem. A couple days later a different WiFi-connected PC wouldn't connect. Rebooting the Netgear fixed the problem. A couple days after that, all the WiFi-connected PCs lost Internet connection (although they still had LAN connectivity), yet the Ethernet-connected PCs did not lose the Internet. Rebooting the Netgear was again necessary to fix the problem.This is unacceptable behavior; I want the thing to just sit there and work and not require constant attention. I returned it to Amazon. I'm back on the old Belkin, and I'll have to try something else for those modern features that I want.",,,

After setup, it was not clear to me how to access all of the features.

It seems as though the router can't maintain communication very well during streaming videos so it stalls on virtually every play.  You have to reload the page in order to complete the vid.  Since the web is loaded with videos now, it is a constant reminder of how poor the performance is on this router.  I would gladly settle for my old Cisco now, except I gave it to a friend....Oh well, another data point.  Stay away from this router is my recommendation.",,,

I can't find an address on their website for returns so I guess I'll wait until they fix the other part of the web site.

I now know better.I have spent 2 sessions of 3+ hours each attempting to add this device to an existing network. My network already has a boundary firewall, DNS server, and DHCP server. The installation procedure of this device assumes it, itself, is the single network manager inside a residential cable modem arrangement.  ( PC&lt;-->WNDR3700&lt;-->Internet)In my configuration, this was 1 of multiple APs; in a network with existing DNS and DHCP.(PC&lt;->3700&lt;->(servers,DHCP,DNS,Firewall)&lt;->Internet)The problems I had with the configuration are:-- NO static IP for the 'Internet' interface. I could find no configuration web server on this interface. This really was just 'UpStream'. There is a section called'Remote Management', but is not clear what 'remote' meant. I could hard-wire my DHCP to the 3700's MAC, but that is a kludge and out of scope.-- Regardless of the setting in the 'LAN SetUp' the router did private DHCP on the 4 LAN ports and WiFi. This gave all connected devices useless IPs. And NATed everyone to the same IP. It couldn't simple pass the requests up stream.-- The installation leaves a link to [...]. If you attempt to resolve that to an IP on the internet, it fails. It probably only works if you use the device as your DNS server!-- Reviewing the 'setupmanual.pdf' included with the device does not present the actual installation procedure (it diverges at Page 17, step 6)In the end, after configuring and rebooting, the WiFi accepted connections, but never assigned an IP to that connection. The management interface could not be found on the wan ports due to not knowing what IPs the device was naming itself. On my second attempt, I was able to connect from an Android phone through the WiFi. Unfortunately, it assigned a 192.168.1.2 address, even though DHCP was not active by configuration.It probably does everything it advertises. It just doesn't do things to allow the user much flexibility. And the supplied doc do not match the actual installation.",,,

That averages to 2 stars.Netgear sucks!Update 1:ok, I head this over a month now. a couple more things to add. i dont like netgear as a company. this router is pretty stable for me, but the firmware, the admin console has a few bugs and inconveniences, and it seems netgear doesn't really respond to fixing them all that quickly.  i just get the feeling, more than other companies, netgear tries to squeeze every last drop of profit from their customers. one issue is when i try to do an update, it says no connection to the internet. on the netgear forum, some people say its because the server is down, but thats been several days. its been down for 4 days so far. what the heck!!?? a few other people including me sometimes get a 'no devices attached' situation where the firmware doesn't 'see' the connected devices. most of these issues are due to maybe a buggy firmware version.  if netgear is smart they better come out with a firmware update that fixes these problems fast.  other than this gripe, for me, on a day to day basis, its running alright.Original:This was worth the upgrade. I got 5x the speed on wired ports now (had to use cat6 cables), as well as 5x the speed on wifi. A couple of things I don't like though. When you change a setting, then save, it seems to take a long time, like 20 seconds to save, seems kind of long. My old router took under 5 seconds to save settings. Another small thing... to configure port forwarding is flexible but tedious compared to my old router. You have to make a couple of clicks to add a forward, and also each forward you add is always enabled, if you want to disable it, you have to delete it. I don't like that as I want to keep the setting even though its disabled. I made a workaround for that though. Just set some inaccessible ip to forward to so in effect its not active. Overall love the speed. 5x the old wifi and wired speeds! Happy with it.",,,

The router itself was lightweight and wonderful to look at.I however was extremely disappointed with this router's price and what the company claimed it could do in exchange.The range was actually very small even using the 2.4 Ghz band. I live in a studio, and the strength signal bars (Mac computer)would go down considerably by just going to my back porch. I'd previously bought a smaller netgear router which I had exchanged for the new one, as that one was only 150 mbps and couldn't read HD videos well.  The bigger one didn't fare any better in terms of covering more range and watching HD videos online.On the 5 Ghz band, the coverage wouldn't even extend any further than the room I was in, and it's a tiny room; I was really surprised at that.But then, and this was the most frustrating issue with this router, was the fact that the HD videos would systematically stall on youtube when this router was clearly advertised as being able to handle HD videos. I use cable, and usually HD videos function quasi-seamlessly when plugged in directly from modem to computer so it wasn't a modem issue.On the 5 Ghz band, the HD videos would stall just as well and in fact just as bad as the previous smaller, cheaper netgear router that I'd bought for only $40 some bucks.I tried dealing with this for almost a month, until a friend gave me his Linksys ($60) router.  I must say I finally returned the dual band guy, and I can actually say that the Linksys (much cheaper router) is quite smoother and handles videos better than the bigexpensive guy. So all in all, I find that Netgear didn't try their product well before releasing it. It's definitely not worth the money, it has great potential to be an awesome router, but it isn't in spite of all of its good qualities, and from I've read from other enchanted reviews.It didn't do some of the most important things it was advertised as. This is a typical case of companies overly eager to either make money from a product that's initially a good idea, but falls short of what it's supposed to do, or companies that focus more on the competition than actually making a solid product that does basic stuff, but does it well at least.Just a thought.",,,

Wireless coverage was a little limiting, but it could easily hand my apartment. But now, the lights are not blinking, and it is dead. This is unacceptable for a router of this price. Consumer wireless routers are crap in general, so I was hoping spending $150 bucks on a router would be the ticket home, but alas, once again, I am let down.

Another real plus was the range of the wireless signal on both G and N.Unfortunately, beyond this it simply doesn't work - or work properly. As others have pointed out, many of the features are not accessible or flat out don't work.  But most frustrating was that the router kept dropping the connection from one or more computers at any given time. This required constant resetting of the router to regain the connection with the computers.NetGear support was non-existent.  No recent firmware release to correct the issues.  Internet searches and NetGear's support forums indicate that this router has issues but there are no fixes (at least yet).Fortunately, Amazon has great customer service and took my defective router back.",,,
529,XX,B002HWRJY4,2,3,4,23-May-10,A167KIIUU75L1V,Very disappointed in this product,"I bought this based on the positive reviews up here and elsewhere.  My experience has been a sharp contrast with all the positives I've read.1.  Limited range.  I replaced a Belkin Pre-N wireless router that I've used forever.  I put it in the exact same spot as the Belkin.  This one has less range and limited connectivity.  It will not reach all the rooms in my home that the Belkin did.  I may have to send it back if I can't find a solution.2.  Ease of installation.  Everyone says this is so easy.  I launched the installation wizard and discovered to my dismay that it does not support Vista 64-bit operating systems.  So, installation required two phone calls to India.3.  Technical support.  It took two phone calls because the first guy -- who was impatient and short-tempered -- hung up on me while I was away from the phone trying to find a power point to plug in the router.  The problem was that the transformer is oddly configured (in the plug) so that it took too much space to plug into the one open slot on my surge protector.  I will say that the second tech I got was much more helpful and stuck with me until we got the router installed successfully.4.  Too little bandwidth.  I bought this router to upgrade to dual band to transmit to a new Samsung TV.  We watched one Netflick using the old Belkin and we had about 6 interruptions for dropped signals.  With the new router, we were unable to watch a single Netflick on either band -- we had maybe six interruptions within the first five minutes.5.  No documentation.  There is no user manual or installation manual in the box.  This is absurd to pay $150 for a router and not even receive a paper manual on how to install and use it.All-in-all this has been extremely depressing, especially considering the high expectations that I had based on the reviews.  I will stick with it a while longer, reading the on-line user manual for tips on how to improve the range and bandwidth.  If that fails I'm willing to call India again, but so far this product is inferior to outdated technology that was working almost adequately.",,,

One thing to note is N has pretty short range.  This isn't necessarily the router, rather the spectrum N uses.  One of the main things I need a good, reliable router for is Ooma VOIP.This router reboots randomly during VOIP calls, disconnecting the call.  Pretty frustrating when you are on conference calls.  I've tried every setting with QOS, etc, and it still does it.  Also it tends to get 'paralyzed' at times which prevents you from loading any web pages.  The signal is there, but it won't connect to the web.  Solution?  Unplug, wait, plug back in.  Then it works for another few days (but still disconnects Ooma VOIP calls).I finally had it with this thing.  I bought the Apple Airport Extreme and it works wonderfully.  I can Ooma, stream from my two Squeezeboxes, Have four computers connected, stream Netflix, and stream a movie from my Windows Home Server to my PS3...all at the same time with no reboots, etc.I can't recommend this router because the firmware is just too buggy.  It's unreliable as a business tool.  Once Tomato or DD-WRT makes its way to it, my guess is it will be better (the hardware specs are impressive).My two cents.  It's great on paper, but falls short for serious applications (home office use).",,,

New connections simply fail to resolve dns. The only solution is to reboot/powercycle the router. I've had it go for a couple months or so, then fail several times in a week. If I get a month between reboots, I feel lucky.Secondly, this high end, expensive router, fails to have the basic feature of Port Address Translation (PAT). Meaning you can not map/re-direct external ports to internal port/ips. You can only do a straight ip map. This means you can not setup multiple external SSH, VNC, remote desktop or other services without reconfiguring each of the equipment to listen on non-standard ports.Thirdly, while I knew this router did not have in/outbound VPN support, its very disappointing for something of this expense and class to not have it.Forth, I've had the router auto-reconfigure the LAN ip from 192.168.1.x to 10.x.x.x on occasion when my dsl modem fails to connect or pickup right away (typically after a power outage when both router and dsl have been down). I have to switch a PC manually over to 10.x and reconfigure the router back to 192.168.x network. Its extremely aggravating.I've seen 2 firmware updates, but neither made any apparent improvement in stability or features.",,,

My experiences are as follows...I wanted to upgrade my old linksys router (wrt54g) to something a little bit more on par with todays technology.  With our new HP Home Mediaserver (EX495) serving out our files, our 2 laptops, 2 desktops, 2 PS3's, 1 Xbox, and our slew of Netflix junkies, we especially needed something with gigabit speeds for all the internal network trafic that was going on.Guest Network.  First I was a bit suprised when I saw this, and I thought it would be a great idea for our next door neighbor that we share our network with for a small monthly fee.  Simply pop her on it, and not have to worry about her stumbling on our shared media.  Well the theory was great, but upon enabling the guest network, things stopped working.  With it enabled, anytime we made changes to the router, we had to manually press the 'turn on radio' button on the front of the router because the GUI one wouldn't work.  This would be okay I suppose.... IF it worked.  Any time we turned on the guest network, all of our default networking died so we ended up turning off this feature and pretending like we never found it and got all suprised in the first place.UPNP.  In short, it doesn't work (properly).  Our Mediaserver has an option to program our router for the port forwarding for remote access.  The old router (wrt54g) worked fine.  I manually ended up forwarding the ports and this worked fine.USB Network storage - 'supposedly' it's slow.  I'd tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so I never got far enough to try this.  I was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow.  Hey, I like to make my own opinions.SLOW GUI - Be prepared to wait approximately 90 seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded 'apply' button... yes, 1 1/2 minutes!-----------------Speeds/Throughput:  I didn't have any complaints.  It was nice to have the faster internal network speeds while we tested this router (which was for all of about 3 hours while trying to get everything to work properly).Due to the lack of support for WHS / UPNP / Guestnetwork, and having just dropped the bones for this router, I was very unimpressed.  I could have spent &lt;$50 and gotten a router that did everything this one was able to do.  Had this one done what it claimed, I'd have been very satisfied....NOTE: My problems were on both the initial BIOS (V1.0.4.43NA) and on the upgraded latest bios (V1.0.4.55NA)",,,

Unfortunately I found that the execution lagged far behind the promise. Many of the basic features of the router were suggested to be turned off by tech support as a means of fixing the myriad problems many have experienced, features such as UPnP, SPI, and Traffic monitor. Not to mention suggestions that using bit torrent is not a supported use of the router. The firmware was drastically lacking as well with many strange options missing such as being able to turn off the radios as desired.In short the troubles I had were only exacerbated by the support staff who failed to read my submission carefully on multiple occasions. I'm not a networking professional but I have a much higher level of knowledge than the average home user so it is somewhat annoying to be told that my modem is not handing an IP address to the router when I have already provided a depth of information that proves absolutely otherwise.I'll not be buying any netgear products until I get reliable word of mouth recommendations from my acquaintances.

Before the swap, I did an internet speed test on all three of my computers (desktop on a 1GB Cat 5E line, laptop using 2.4 GHz N, and TouchSmart All-in-One on a 2.4 GHz N).  I was getting about 7 Mbs on the desktop and 5 Mbs on the wireless devices.  Immediately after the router swap I ran the tests again and had over 10 Mbs on all three (50% improvement on the desk top and 100% improvement on the wireless devices).  I also used to get intermittent Netflix HD quality streaming over my LG BD Player (wired), but the first (and only so far) time I tried it with the new router it went right to HD.  So far it looks like the best $150 I've spent in a while.The setup disk didn't like my 64 bit Win 7 Home, but the manual set up was straight forward (I guess I could have tried the 32 bit emulation mode, but didn't think of it in time).UPDATE:After a year, I started having intermittent network issues that would usually clear up if I rebooted the router.  I finally replaced it with an older Linksys WRT320N that I had, and all of my network issues disappeared.  I'm now getting 20+ Mbs downlink, and the VERY annoying stuttering that I was constantly getting when streaming recorded TV from my WHS to my HP Media Center Extender is completely gone.  I'll miss having the dual band N capability, but being able to use my WHS/MCE setup the way I had intended is so sweet!

668,XX,B002HWRJY4,2,4,9,13-Jan-10,A2Y2ABB8QZMWAB,"Poor Performance, Buggy software","Poor performance. Buggy Software.I gave it a rating of 2 stars because of its fast connection speed within a short range. Anyone having a simple system with all computers within a close vicinity and needing the 5ghz mode would be happy. Anyone else: Beware.I have had a D-Link DI-624 router which has performed well for 5 years. I expected that newer wireless routers with the latest technology should show a big improvement. As a result I decided to upgrade and ended up purchasing the NETGEAR WNDR-3700 router because of its advertised features, recent release, and that it had dual mode capability of both 2.4 and 5GHz to allow streaming video.  Bad mistake.The 2.4 and 5 GHZ modes perform very well in Wireless N and Wireless A but only within a short distance of about 20 feet.  Beyond 25 feet, like in a bedroom, the 5GHZ signal drastically dropped to less than 33 Mbps and often disconnected making that mode useless.  NETGEAR touts the 5GHZ mode for streaming video but you can forget about that unless you are in the same room as the router or an adjacent room.Switching to the 2.4GHZ mode, at the same distance increased the signal but only to 54Mbps, which is the same as with my old D-Link router.  Tech Support finger pointed to my computer (it's never their product) but I have three late model computers, two running Vista, and they all received the same signal strength. Perhaps the poor performance is due to NetGear using internal antennas.  The manufacturer claims internal antennas do not impact signal performance but as an Electrical Engineer I know it does. The main reason, not mentioned, is manufacturing cost as everything including antennas can be placed on one circuit board rather than using discrete wiring and external antennas.  Even these limitations would have been tolerable (since it is fast at close range) if it were not for other problems listed below.NETGEAR advertises a super fast processor but it appears to have no effect. The router takes a minute or more to reboot and reboots for every configuration change. My five year old DLink reboots in less than 20 seconds and it can accept multiple configuration changes before it reboots.For initial setup the so called Smart Wizard Setup program automatically walks you through the setup, connecting the router to the Internet. It is so easy that anyone without any computer or network knowledge should have no difficulty.  It is so basic that there is  a separate screen for each cable connection. But It also gives an option, for persons with some computer knowledge,  to bypass the basic steps.  Even though I have network experience I opted for the basic setup so as not to accidentally miss anything.  During the setup the program asked if this were to be a new installation, or a replacement for an existing router. I checked: Existing router, assuming that it would copy the DHCP IP settings from the old router. But it did not. Instead it issued completely new configuration settings as if the old router never existed.  This caused problems since all D-Link and other routers use IP settings of 0 instead of a 1.  IE: 192.168.0.1 instead of 192.168.1.1. This caused the assigned IP's of all client devices to change. Video cameras which had static IP's could no longer be accessed.  Manually setting the router IP to 192.168.0.1 and entering static IP addresses for the Video Cameras allowed these devices to again function.  No mention of this was made in the documentation.  The documentation stated that fixed IP address for client devices may be entered into the Address Reservation block and the router would then assign those fixed addresses to the various devices.  This did not work. The router continued to randomly assign DHCP addresses and ignored the fixed addresses that had been entered. Therefore direct or remote access of devices, using a browser such as Firefox or Internet Explorer, could not be done as the addresses would change each time a device or the router was rebooted. Remote access of Video Cameras could not be accomplished as one would not know the correct IP to enter.Incomplete Wireless Security modes were another problem. WEP is supposed to have both an Open and Shared option. Only the Shared mode was allowed by the software. Therefore devices which require an Open key had to have the pass phrase entered each time the system was booted.  WPA-PSK mode is supposed to have both a TKIP and AES option. However the NETGEAR router only allowed a TKIP option. Devices which used the AES option could not be accessed.  WPA-PSK mode is supposed to be backward compatible with WEP in order to allow legacy devices, which only used WEP, to access the system.  No backward compatibility existed with this router. Therefore Video cameras could not be accessed.One of the features advertised by NETGEAR is a Push to Connect feature. A special button and indicator light is present on the router. NETGEAR states in their advertising, that pushing this button would automatically connect all client devices.  Only in the documentation is it stated that client devices must have special software (not included) to make this happen. Acquiring and installing the software for each client computer is much more difficult than simply booting each client computer and clicking Connect when the Connection to Network message pops up.A minor annoyance is the extremely bright amber lights supplying almost useless information.  Who cares if a wired LAN connection is operating at 1GHZ or 100 Mhz.  Add those 4 lights, if there are 4 LAN connections, then add other functioning lights for power, 2.4ghz, 5ghz, Internet, USB  and the unit lights up like a Christmas tree. Plus the lights are constantly blinking whenever there is any activity and there is no way to dim the lights.This NETGEAR WNDR 3700 router was returned as defective for poor performance, weak signal connection, and buggy software.  Apparently the device was rushed to market with inadequate testing.Bottom Line:  Save your money. A $40 router with external antennas should work better.",,,

Over the years, we have had a few routers, all with mostly good but not perfect wireless performance.  Our current Linksys has been the most dependable for 2 years, gving us better than 95% connect time on the other side of the house.  It is that other 5% down time that prompted a purchase of this new router.The features are wonderful in principle.  The ability to set up guest networks, detailed permissions, and plug in a USB storage device are terrific.  Basic performance over a direct ethernet cable was as expected.  Laptops and wireless connected just fine when they were in the same room as the router.  The problem was that outside of the same room, performance degraded quickly.  For the desktop computers on the other side of the house, about 40 feet away, there was NO connection to the internet - period.Calls to Netgear tech support did not help.  The support tech was polite but only read through typical boilerplate screens and was not useful.  The bottom line from the support guy was that if a laptop nearby could connect, then the router was working properly.  I even ordered new dual band Netgear adapters to replace the current Linksys adapters on the other machines, but that did not solve the problem.  The bottom line was that using any other combination of computers, routers, adapters, and positioning of the devices resulted in our typical 1-2 bar signal strength with a positive internet connection.  But when the Netgear WNDR3700 router was used to deliver the signals, no go.With my current router, I have a connection which is on 95% of the time, and usually easy to restore by fiddling with antennas or restarting the router.  I had hoped that the new Netgear router would give me a 100% dependable connection.  Instead, it gave me an unfixable zero percent connection for anything more than 30 feet away.  Depending on the size and shape of your house and where the router will sit in relationship to the computers may make the difference for you whether the device performs or not.If you will have your computers all connected by ethernet cable, or if you will be using a laptop in the same room, then this may a good item to get, for the variety of features.  But if you are going to depend on wide area coverage, this looks like a dud.  The price is quite high compared to other routers, presumably because it is a newer model with many features, but it is of no value if it cannot connect.I have no idea if my particular unit was defective or if this is a generic fault in this model.  It has gotten many nice reviews here, so perhaps my unit was bad, or perhaps everyone else has a better house geometry.  In the end, tech support was useless, and so was the router for my rather humble needs, so I returned it.  Because it was sold by Buy.com, not in-house by Amazon, the return had to be handled by Buy.com, but all went well.  If you buy it and it works well for you, good!  But if your adapters are 40 feet away and they cannot connect to the internet, don't waste time looking for a fix - just return it and try something else.",,,

It's this last one that causes the two star rating:  the static routing is broken, and it makes most features of my VPN unusable.  Some traffic, like ICMP, makes it through fine; other traffic, like port 139 smb traffic, only makes it partially through.  It took lots of time using Wireshark on several computers to figure out exactly what was wrong, but it's pretty obvious when some TCP packets show up on one side of the router but not the other where things are getting stuck.  A posting to Netgear's forums has gone unanswered, attempts to log it with Netgear support ran into a server error on their web site.

No new wireless equipment in the house either, that I could attribute the flakey behavior to either.Its a WNDR3700 V2.Symptoms: what I noticed most/first was that wireless connectivity from my iOS devices (iPhone, iPad) to only certain hardwired devices, stopped working.  So connecting from my iPhone via wifi to the network wired xlink print device that lets me print to my hard wired networked laser printer would stop working.  Using the browswer on the iphone I could got the built in website of the 3700 router.. though it loaded slowly, but the iPhone could not bring up the website on the laser printer.  From a hardwired PC, I could bring up the website of the laser printer just fine.  So something about that connection and/or protocol from the iOS device to the laser printer was not working.  Using the iPhone to tell the 3700 (via its website) to reboot worked well, and after the reboot, I could see the printer again (and recall I could always see the printer from hardwired computers.. so the printer isn't the problem).  Then after several days the connectivity would go down again. I could see the internet but not my printer (from my iOS devices).First I figured, this may be something pecuilar to iOS WiFi and the 3700, as even the wifi connectivity to my MacMini would similary become unavailable, but I soon discovered the network connectivity from my Nest wifi thermostat also lost wifi connectivity.  Thats not an apple product.So the wireless connectivity between some devices went away, very strange.  I could always connect wifi from the iPhone to the router, and have it reset, and then things worked again, but eventually, now almost once a day, I need to reset the router.I've got to think its something that went bad on the hardware that some specific type of wifi feature set fails after some time.

Was able to stream Netflix and play games without any issue. The performance wasn't any better or worse from cheap $30 routers I've used. Not a knock on them, just that I didn't get some unique experience. I do find their control panel to be atrocious. It's slow, clunky, and times out frequently.My biggest gripe however is with the lifespan. Just around 18 months. Sure routers die out, but considering this was one of their high end options and at a cost of just under $100, I expected a little more use. Now I'm not a heavy user, so it's not like it was being taxed too hard. And reading other reviews it seems like this is a common problem. Perhaps it's a design flaw or maybe they just went cheap with materials. But you definitely should get more than 18 months out of a router of that price.If you're going to buy Netgear for home use, my suggestion is to stick to their cheaper models. At least when they die out, you're only out $30. If you're looking for high performance, Asus makes a nice one for a bit more and D-Link has a solid dual band router in the DIR-868L.

I have performed significant trouble shooting and network analyzing.  What I learned is that the 2.4Ghz signal strength, which is the one for range, is woefully inadequate now.  Disappointing because this is not exactly an entry level device for Netgear.  I had thought that maybe the issue was related to interference on the channel, but no, network analysis revealed that there was no interference.  Just plain old weak signal strength.  I also tried installing the new firmware, again, to no avail.  I am forced to say that this router appears to be good for a year, maybe a little more, and then the issues start.

I received a phone call from Dinesh Kannappan, whom, I had never communicated with before - nor heard of him. He is a technical support engineer from Netgear's HQ in San Jose CA.Dinesh asked to sent the new unit to his lab for test (which I did). Few days later, he informed me that, he flashed the PROM in the Router, and made sure all the Software is update-to-date. Also he run a two day continued rigorous test, after which he found it working fine.After receiving the Router, Dinesh advised me to contact my Internet provider, to 'Reset & Restart' my account. Then I tried the unit with no problem - while he kept in touch with me, to monitor, and make sure the unit works as promised. He also suggested to keep the case open for 10 days, to make sure everything is fine with my unit.What is fair is fair. Netgrear did stand behind its product.

1787,XX,B002HWRJY4,2,4,4,2-Feb-13,AYP0Q38O2R1JQ,Would not Recommend this,I purchased this router over a year ago.  I finally left Linksys and decided that I would go with a company that many in my field said was one of the best.  CNET and other online web sources rated it one of the better choices.  I can't argue that the router performed okay for the first 3 months.  I did start to see patterns where the router would loose connection to the internet and I would have to reboot it once every three days or so.  I tried working with fios and seemed that all their settings worked perfectly which lead me to believe that there was another root issue.  This didn't change the constant rebooting I had to do with my router.  What really added a game changing opinion here was the addition of 4 new wireless devices on my network.  For some reason this device had issues allowing all types of hardware to connect to it. At any given point it would slow my internet to a crawling stop and even hose my Vonage. I made the decision to move off this router and get a new one.  I recommend the MediaLink over this router any day of the week on performance and price comparison alone.What I had plugged in wirelessly:-  3 laptops-  Wireless print server-  2 Iphones-  2 Androids-  Ipad-  Galaxy 10-  wireless scale-  Heart rate monitor-  wireless thermostat-  Google boxAt any given point 4 devices would always fail and I would have to reboot this router.  Additionally the user interface is very complicated and frustrating.  Making changes take forever and the unit seems to overheat at times.  All and all I was extremely disappointed.,,,

Unfortunately, I was unable to ever come close to the advertised speed of 300Mbps on the 5Ghz wireless N side.  The closest I ever get is around 108Mbps and I am only about 10 feet away from the router.  I've tried to change the channel to every single channel available and still was unsuccessful at getting the network speed to go above 108Mbps.My old Time Capsule ran at 5Ghz only and I was able to get the 300Mbps speed without any issue sitting in the same exact spot.  It appears that there is some sort of issue here and I will most likely be sending this device back and looking into something else.I even checked to see if there was a firmware update but it looks like this device is still using the original version of the firmware and that there is no update since that firmware.",,,

Seems I was blaming those products for continual issues when, after reviewing other buyer's issues, it appears to be the Netgear.  I am very tired of having to redo my TV wireless setup each time, and the printer will only recognize my network sporadically.  It seems that this router has DHCP issues...now I don't profess to be an expert, but this things seems to reassign addresses randomly.  That's as technical as I'll get here.  The Netgear website incorrectly led me to a firmware upgrade which was not even valid.Time is too precious to waste much more time on this thing, so I am probably going to do some research and make another purchase.  Maybe the IT folks that recommended Netgear to me had better experiences with older models (or are savvy enough to get around the issues), but after this I doubt I will go down this road again.",,,

Using MetaGeek's InSSIDer I see the signal is -50 Amplitude right next to the router and down to -90 thirty feet away.  That -90 is too low for a reliable connection on 2.4.  My iPad will hold at thirty feet using the 5 GHz channel, but the laptops only have 2.4 wireless.This signal loss can occur on some of this model soon after install or later as on mine, see [...] for more on this.  I am negotiating with Netgear support for a repair or new router.Your later post: Feb 5, 2013Netgear warranty RMA'd me a replacement wndr3700v2, but that too has this low 2.4G signal issue. It appears they just took another router sent back with an issue, reflashed it and sent it to me as a placebo.

I enjoyed it well for 2 years until one of the two radios died. This unit has two radios. One radio supports B and G networks and includes the guest network, the other radio supports N networks which are faster. Unfortunately, it was the radio that supported the guest network feature that croaked. It's not totally dead but the chip is fried to the point where it drops constantly. I used it as an AP in my living room supporting about 8 clients consisting of smartphones, laptops and tablets. No heavy use at all. One radio still works (802.11 N) and the gigabit ethernet ports still work so it's useful in my bedroom as an AP since the range of the N radio is so weak.NOTE- If you aren't tech savvy enough to follow manuals and figure out basic troubleshooting on your own, DO NOT BUY ANY NETGEAR PRODUCTS! Netgear has the worst customer support. They have a system where you get a really short term of support and after that they charge you to answer any questions at all. They will constantly try to sell you a worthless support contract where they promise to help you with any network problem on any device. Don't buy it. It is a total ripoff because their support staff are completely clueless. Trying to get an RMA from these guys is a total PITA and you will get the runaround from some less than friendly folks in third world countries. I can't tell you how many hours and lies I've gotten from these people.Buyer beware. Don't say I didn't warn you.Overall, I'd say pass on this Wifi router. There are many sub-$50 gigabit ethernet routers/switches and sub-$50 Wifi router/APs out there that won't die within two years of usage, from manufacturers that won't make you want to go postal. I used to be a fan of Netgear products but after investing in a NAS and this router and seeing them both have serious problems with no support and horrible firmware updates I won't be giving them any of my money again.",,,

It is not capable of automatically switching between 2.4 and 5 GHz networks, so you must have *two* separate SSID's and pick manually with your devices which one to use.  Though the documentation claims that it can act to extend an existing wireless network, there are no instructions for enabling this fairly complicated feature; when I discovered how, it turns out that it can only extend an *unencrypted* network (i.e. no WPA2).

So far it was worth the cost of the 6200r in terms of REAL speed improvment. Hope it lasts longer than a year. No there is not a better router available currently. I even tried the apple airport v5 and it suffered from the limited speed problem and there is not way to get to any setting to fix it.also the 6300r has 2 usb ports that are just as useless for an extra $50.00. stick to the 6200r",,,

After two purchases, the WRT54G, while dying, is still in action. Why? The consumer networking industry has forgotten how to build Parental Control into a router.If you saw the claim by Netgear for their Live Parental Controls that has 'Centralized & easy-to-use website filtering for all devices connected to the Internet via the router' and thought that it would be great for your family? Think again. Those Live Parental Controls require OpenDNS and other external setup and configuration. It is NOT built into the router firmware. Very disappointing.Also a major head scratcher is that the WNDR3700v4's Keyword filtering and Block Sites is NOT done with MAC Address, but IP Address! To make matters worse, instead of creating a list of blacklisted devices that have policies assigned to them, Netgear has you add all the devices you want to Whitelist. Are you kidding me? Finally, in the keyword filtering, there is a box that says 'Allow Trusted IP Address to view blocked sites', and you only get to add ONE of your Trusted IPs. WTF are you thinking Netgear?I only made it far enough to let the WNDR3700 detect my connection and let me start setting things up, first and foremost the above. I cannot comment on the wireless/wired performance or anything else about this hardware. I'm returning this and moving on to the next vendor.

Decided to try this, and our connectivity is much better. Range reads as a bit less than that linksys, possibly owing to the fact that that one had 3 big antennas poking out of it, and this one's got everything tucked inside.-----------------------------------Edit: been running this for a couple months now. Seems fairly solid, but range has been lacking a bit, and some of the alleged features don't actually work at all.For instance: 'Guess access' doesn't work. If you enable it, guests have access to your entire LAN, as if it weren't guest access at all. When you tick off the boxes to restrict access to the local network, then no one can connect to the guest channel at all. There are forum posts about this issue at netgear suggesting a firmware upgrade BUT there are many, many more forum posts detailing that the firmware upgrade can be a nightmare, and rolling back (if necessary) and even bigger nightmare. It was a non-issue for me anyway as Netgear's support site is broken and didn't let me get the firmware files. (lucky me, I guess).",,,

Namely, 'attached devices' does not register all devices on the network no all of the DHCP leases. The router does strange things with ICMP on the local lan. Basically, I cannot scan the network for live hosts. It seems to rewrite the ACK ICMP with the originating device's IP. DHCP reservation does not work at all.###################Other ThoughtsDD-WRT is not stable on the router.SSH would be nice###################Conclusion:I'm considering shelving this router and going back to my WNR3500 with Tomato.

With regards to the current router, I can't make it port forward to different computers on the LAN using the same internal port number 3389 for RDP, it seems the interface wants to have a different internal port number for each computer that I want to remote desktop, that's stupid.

It hosts both Ethernet and wireless devices on both 2.5GHz and 5GHz wireless networks.  It is now June 2012 and in the last 2-3 weeks we have all been noticing that the wireless access has become very flaky.  There are times when all devices get dropped and other times when devices appear connected but are unable to transmit/receive data.  I haven't changed any settings lately, it just seems to have become unstable.  I have power cycled the Netgear AP a couple of times but it doesn't seem to help.  In a different part of the house I have another wireless network that passes its traffic back to this Netgear access point over Ethernet and find that this second wireless device is very stable and fast.  It isn't a conflict between the two devices because they coexisted for several months without problems until recently.  Also, I live in a rural area where my neighbors aren't very close so I don't believe there is any interference introduced by them.  If you want a device that you can setup and forget, this may not be the one.  I was very happy with it until recently and now I'm going to have to play with settings to try and figure out if it is a firmware configuration  problem or if the hardware is just bad.",,,

I had used if for over a year as that and no matter what I did only 5% of my video files were accessible from any TV.So the past week I have purchased a Seagate FlexGo Home and everything works good now.So if your buying this to be a DNLA server for a extra hard drive, DON'T waster your money, it's a ROUTER and that is the only good thing it does.After over a year using this product I have decided to go back to Linksys.

Can not Recommend this Product Anymore.)The Range of the WiFi Router has dropped significantly after ~13months of use for no apparent reason, apart from having new Neighbots in adjacent Appts moving in during the past year.Now I can hardly get any signal in 2 of the Rooms in my 2 Bdr Apt (~12 Feet away) while the Signal Sterngth drops to about half when more than 6ft away from Router. The Router has remained at same location at all times, with no changes to any hardware settings or mving any other applioances in close proximity.Since I have an Electronics Engineering background, I tried the following to check if the Signal would improve from 1 Bar at 12 ft away to Full Bars being normal again:1)'Updated Firmware' from V1.0.0.6 to V1.0.0.12Result: No Observable Signal Range Improvement (still get Full Bars at 6ft and 1 Bar at 12ft)2)Changed 'Wireless Port' Channels on both b/g/n and a/n one at a timeResult: No Observable Signal Improvement Change for any Port Channel Number combination. Reset it back to Auto Default for b/g/n and Channel 44 for a/n3)In 'Advanced Wireless Setting' I switched 'Preamble Mode' from 'Auto' to 'Short'Result: No Observable Wireless Signal Range Improvement. Reset back to AUTOMATIC.4)In 'Wireless Settings' I Switched from WPA2-PSK [AES] to NONE.Result:No Observable Wireless Signal Range Improvement.

2599,XX,B002HWRJY4,2,0,0,5-Apr-12,A3L57KDR9O67JL,Good as long as you avoid using the USB,"WNDR3700V2 - Bought March 2012 - Despite some years ago a previous Netgear Router(WPN824) starting to drop service after just over a year, and necessitating the reversion to the D Link DI-624, it was meant to replace, thought would try Netgear again.Setup was not quite as straightworward as would have hoped and eventually got it up and running within an hour.Wireless connectivity was great and an improvement on the DI-624.Problems arose when connected a storage device (Seagate Freeagent Go Flex 500GB - on the Netgear 'compatible' list for this Router) to the USB port.  It originally worked but was incredibly slow and then on about the third time of use it could not be found.  Following which the wire connection to a laptop on a docking station failed to work - the laptop on the docking station could 'see' the Router but not the network or internet, other wired computers were fine and turning the wireless on (and then off) on the docking station laptop resolved the problem.  But it occurred every time the laptop was undocked/docked.  The USB storage could still not be accessed from any computer.OK so it probably has something to do with the laptop being taken back and forth on and off the docking station, and if all it had required was a reboot of the laptop each time then that could have been lived with but with paying extra and the USB not working, it is going back before being stuck with it and the (almost ten years old now) DI-624 is back in service.",,,

Could not get it to work as it kept kicking off the devices after about 2-5 minutes.  I spent over 2 hours on tech support, working my way up the food chain to senior techs.  Same drill, no resolution.  They would never acknowledge that the unit could be faulty.  Fed up, I finally returned it for a refund.  I would point out that at one point, the Netgear tech claimed my computer was at fault and tried to sell me a $300 off site computer service.  Anyway, I bought an Asus after investigating (model RT56u), hooked it up in a few minutes following easy instructions.  Amazingly, every device worked immediately: desktop, laptop, 2 smartphones, mac and smart tv.  No problems at all.  This proves that either the Netgear device was defective, too hard to set up or just buggy.  What angers me is the time that I spent on this equipment and the inadequate tech help that they provide at Netgear.  So remember that if you have a problem with this router, it might not be you after all but a defect in the router.  Personally, I am really happy with the Asus.  A bit hard to find, but worth the wait for me.",,,

Unfortunately, it's out of warranty, so I'm stuck with a box that's essentially now a Gigabit hub (which I can pick up from Amazon for $30).The reason I don't give a 1-star because Netgear support did try their best to help me troubleshoot it over the phone.

I called support twice before I installed it because somebody mentioned that this dual band will automatically find the appropriate band for each device. My devices are set up to automatically connect to my single band router so I asked if I can give the use the same SSID I have in my old Netgear router and also use the same SSID for both bands of the new one.  I was told it was fine.  When I installed the router, it would not allow me to use the same SSID for both, so I called again.  I was told it should be ok and she walked me through the Netgear Genie (same steps that I did before) and of course with the same result.  After she place me on hold, she asked me to add &#34;-5G&#34; to the other SSID and of course it accepted.  She told me that it will be separate login for the 2 bands.  I told her that the previous Tech told me that the switching will be automatic.  After several reiterations of the issue, she finally told me  that once logged into one band the router should be able to figure what band to use.When I started using the router,  I noticed that my devices have slowed down (Ipad, Google TV, Laptop),  The laptop is directly wired to the router and it is still slow compared to my old Netgear N300.  I tried to login to the 5Ghz band and it ran faster.  All my devices were set up to connect with the 2.4Ghz band.  When I ran a speedtest I was only getting 1.8 with this router when my modem is doing 12.x to 15.x.I was pleased with my N300 and quite disappointed this N600.",,,

The router worked great for about 6 months and then began to drop connections several times per hour through out the day. Not only does it drop wireless connections, it drops wired connections as well. When the connection goes down you'll know because you'll lose the ability to use the internet as well as the ability to use the network to access other devices and files. I can verify this as well by trying to log in to the router console via routerlogin.net through a hard wired computer. It's a sure thing the router is not working when you can't even access the router log-in itself. I will say that tech support has been great. They have actively emailed me and they even sent me a replacement model. Needless to say, the replacement model has the exact same problems(sure wish I was one of these lucky reviewers with no problems). I've updated firmware, followed all tech support steps, tried new cables, tried computers other than my own and in the end, it's the router that is malfunctioning.Unfortunately, this type of issue seems to occur in similar products by other manufacturers based on reviews I've read from other brands/models. Don't know that you'll find a router that doesn't have negative reviews of this sort but at least I've informed you of my experience with this one. Gave it two stars because it's a great product when it's working and I've been happy with the support but the main thing is that it only works about 30 minutes out of every hour. When the connections go down, they stay down for about 10 minutes typically and then come back up again. Technically, this router only works half of the time. For the price and the brand, this device should work correctly.Note: Did not purchase this item off of Amazon but I did purchase it new from another retailer.

I'm a computer engineer by training and tried everything I could think of - changing the the channels (one by one), updating the firmware to v10, hardware reset, playing with the preamble and tuning other parameters - all to no avail. Measured the dbm: the signal for the 2.4 radio barely registers, although it's fine for the 5Ghz.There are many many people with this exact problem; it is most likely a hardware issue. See, for example threads even in the NETGEAR support forums - just run a Google search on 'WNDR3700 2.4Ghz radio problem'. Usually happens about 3-9 months after purchase, although mine happened in about 45 days.NETGEAR's response (according to online complaints) has been to ship people refurbished models that develop the same problem over time. Some people are onto their third router. I've put in a complaint with NETGEAR and will see how their customer service treats me.

There are media files missing when accessing through either device.  I work in technology and have my own hobbies so I can say with 99% certainty that I'm not the problem.  I can run a DLNA server on my computer and access and play these files through my TV and PS3.  I can even point my DLNA server on the PC to the network folder which is my hard drive attached to the wndr3700 and both devices can see all files but not play the files reliably because the traffic is going back and forth in order to reach the devices (going in circles).  I've had some success in moving files around in order to have them indexed by the router's DLNA but this is also hit and miss.  I've read forums where I'm not the only one with this issue.

I was very excited to get it because so a lot of the positive reviews and for the speeds. I got the router and it took forever to setup. NOT because I didn't know how to set it up but because it wouldn't let me go to routerlogin (whatever the site is) to set it up! After an hour or so I was able to get on the site to set it up.As for speeds, the first few weeks were great. I got pretty decent speeds and connections. However, as soon as I did the update, I lost all my good internet speeds. Eventually, I wasn't even able to stream from Netflix or play a game online without being interrupted at least once or if I wasn't interrupted, I would have terrible internet connections.Hard-lining into the router did not help at all and I got the same speeds hard-lining. I tried resetting the router to its factory conditions, but this has only made the router worse. When I tried calling the customer service, I was put on hold and after 20 minutes I gave up.Lately, my router is completely unreliable! It drops out no less then three times a day, making me have to shut off the router and then reboot it.

However, the wifi part (both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) seem shaky, with frequent connection slowdowns and drops as compared with my 2.4 GHz DSL wifi modem (connection never drops EVER).Above average technical savvy needed with this device to set up, establish secure WPA passwords, etc. Seems to need a power cycle periodically to restore decent wifi access, especially with my wireless network printer.I bought a second laptop (high end Dell XPS 17), but I have the same issues with sluggish/dropped connections. I cannot tell if this is wifi coverage issue or interference with other devices in the home (2.4 GHz PS3 wireless controllers, DSL wifi modem, 5.8 GHz cordless phone).Compared to my 2WIRE and Motorola Netopia DSL wifi router, this is a very unstable device.

I've been maintaining wired and wireless networks in my home for over 15 years so I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of installation, support for both 2.4 and 5 Mhz networks at the same time, and being able to easily configure a guest network.  I connected my cable modem to the router's WAN port, and my desktop PC, OOMA, HP Printer and DISH satellite receiver (via RF wireless) to the 4 LAN ports.  My work laptop, Android phone, wife's iPod and my son's two desktops were all configured to access the wireless network, although typically no more than 3 or 4 of these devices would use it at once.  Once it was all up and running and I upgraded the firmware to 1.0.0.8, my son's computers picked up 3 bars of 5 instead of 2 in wireless signal strength, I no longer needed the fan and all was well ... for about 3 hours.  That's when wireless or both the wired and wireless networks started dropping from the internet.After multiple resets and re-checking the configs, I finally called Netgear tech support. I reviewed my network device environment, router setup, firmware level and my problem.  She had had me change some advanced network settings and the wireless channel. (.soapbox on:  Now I work for a multi-national company and have traveled the world so I generally don't have a big problem with accents, but I found myself having to ask Netgear's support staff in India to repeat themselves A LOT.  And when I'm having a problem with your equipment, let's focus on that and not ask me about my holiday weekend or my hobbies.  .soapbox off:)Now instead of needing a reset every couple of hours, the N600 needed a reset just a couple of times a day. Better, but still a problem since a) my home phone is on this network via the Ooma, and b) Internet access is like electricity and water in my house ... it just *has* to work all of the time.  I called Support again and got new settings to try and was informed of yet another firmware upgrade to download and install manually, which apparently the N600 didn't know existed.  I installed the 1.0.0.10 firmware, and called Support one last time where I got a guy with the thickest accent of all, and began to get frustrated when he started asking all of the same questions about my network set up and devices (I have a case # ... don't they write any of this stuff down?).  He put me on hold to talk to Level 2 Support then came back several minutes later, proclaimed it 'defective', and said to take it back to the store and get another one.  Well I took it back and got a refund (glad I bought it at Wal-mart!).  I'm not sure I believe the problem is just this device, but if I can't trust Linksys or Netgear, my options are getting thin.

Nevertheless I did not face any difficulties setting it up.But guess what. My friends router wifi interface stopped working, and then one month latter mine also stopped working. The problem is related to its coverage range which dropped to less than few feet from the router. My notebook can only access the router via wifi if it is beside the router, even worse the signal is not strong.I searched for support in the manufacturer site to find out that the problem we had has been a recurring problem since early versions of this router. From NETGEAR support I found out that this is not a problem with the routers software. That is a hardware problem.So if you are thinking about buying this router, be advised, you will be very happy.......for only one or two month.",,,

I purchased the router and tried using the CD to do the setup and it couldn't get beyond my having two motherboard ethernet connections. I then called Tech Support. I should have guessed it would have been over a pond as I have trouble with understanding accents. The lady tech person would ask a question and then there always was a huge pause, like being on hold, before I would hear back from her. She said the CD won't work for the install and we will have to manually install. I asked her if I do a reinstall then I should avoid the CD and she said yes. I then asked her if I should do a firmware update and she said I would need to go to their website and match up the firmware I have with what is current on their site. I asked why I couldn't just let the software download a update and she said do it the way she said. We finally got the router up and running, with her help, manually. She said she would send an email asking me to rate her service and was concerned it would be a good response. I then asked her to hold on so I could check to make sure the router was still working. The connection to the Internet had dropped. She then said I would have to go to the site and look up my problem under support or call back and give my case number again. I said it appears your trying to get rid of me and she didn't respond. I never did get an email asking for me to rate her, but I did get a couple of emails that acknowledged my request for support.After several hours and a firmware update through the software I got the router up and running. It has stayed running for several days now, but I'm not sure I'll ever be confident in the router again and will not purchase a NetGear product  because of the lack of decent tech support.The region in the router software shows Africa grayed out with no way to select another country. I called Tech Support back to ask if this would make any difference in how the router would operate in the U.S. They said don't worry about it and it will have no affect. Seems to me they would upgrade their software to fix this as it is something the customer won't be comfortable with and probably generates phone calls to their Tech Support.I always had Linksys routers before and will stay with them in the future. I rarely take the time and effort to post, but I spend a lot of time and effort doing my research before making a purchase and I must say this wasn't what I expected.",,,

I was excited by the fact that the WNDR3700 could do 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz at the same time as well as supported guest networks.Got it home, hooked up, updated the firmware and started to configure my port forwarding for my remote access but it turns out their port forwarding is pretty limited. One example of this limitation is I map port 80 to port 22 for SSH tunneling over proxy servers, no matter what I tried I couldn't get this work. After searching the support forums I found it wasn't supported and was only available in 'Higher End Routers'. Every router I've owned no matter the cost has supported this and I guess I kind of assumed it would be a standard feature by now.The other issue I had with this device is that we would lose our internet connectivity every 5 to 10 minutes unless you were streaming something. For example, I was using the Hang Out option in G+ and video chatting with some friends just fine but when I opened a new tab the page failed to resolve. When I tried my desktop it to failed to resolve the page. Another example is that I was connected on my work laptop through VPN and everything worked great, but every other device in my house responded as if my internet connection was down. I was reading another review stating that the frequent disconnects could be related to the latest firmware. First thing I did was update the firmware to the latest and greatest version.As a side not: the device seems to work rather well if you install DD-WRT but the signal strength isn't nearly as good my old Airport even after using a configuration guide.I'll probably end up trying out a Cisco/Linksys router or if worse comes to worse I'll break down and fork over the retarded amount of money for the new version of the Apple Airport.",,,

Since I have never had experience with wireless components for my home LAN (Local area network), I was hoping to resolve the issue quickly by the Netgear experts.  Well guess what, Netgear's one-year warranty (according to their tech service) does not cover connections to 'third party components' like Interenet ready TVs.  I had to purchase a 6 mo, $69.95 or one-year service contract to get help.  I reluctantly purchased the 6 mo. contract, because I didn't know what else to do.  Then I found out all I had to do was update my router firmware and everything would have worked just fine. All the tech person had to do to help me was to say 'Have you updated your firmware?'

I wanted to use it to access files on any hard drive. It turned out it does not read the ext4 file system. This is really a shame as all Linux distributions use this filesystem now and this means that if you plug the hard drive from any Linux machine it will not be read. I don't understand why, as it must be enough to just upgrade the kernel in the firmware, nothing more complicated than that.Last time I used it to transfer files on the external device, I got no permission to write. I had to reset the USB device in the end but there was no indication that something was wrong on the USB Storage -> Advanced Settings section. It is hard to say where the fault is, but definitely the device is not user friendly and I would definitely not recommend this product to share your files on the network.The router overall works fine and it replaced my previous one with no quirks.

The 2.8Ghz signal was 2 bars higher than the 5Ghz just one room away.

Without any change in the network conditions, the router started to drop Internet connections frequently. I tried everything to no avail. Did a factory reset and started with making extremely minimal customization. But the problem persisted. I've no idea what caused this. The router was absolutely stable in the last year.The unique parental control offered by the Netgear now poses a serious dilemma for me. On one hand, I no longer feel comfortable to buy another Netgear router as a replacement because I somehow feel that the new one is going to have the same problem. On the other hand, I don't want to go without a reasonable solution for parental control..My temporary solution is to use an old SMC router and set up an OpenDNS parental control account on the SMC router. This is the same cloud-based parental control as what Netgear uses. But unfortunately, it does not offer the following two important features (not even with the paid account): (1) customizable time schedules; and (2) bypass user accounts on individual computers.After all these 15 years and more than 10 routers, I haven't found a satisfactory router for home networking! There is something fundamentally wrong with this industry.THE ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have gone through an embarrassing number of routers in the last 10 years, possibly averaging one every year. The last few routers, a D-Link DIR-655 and a SMC WGBR14-N, all proved to be quite good, but the D-Link did not last very long (the thing run untouchablly hot when it was on, so it probably got fried with no surprise), and the SMC, although very reliable, had completely useless web access control. The D-Link was slightly better but also very bad in this aspect.I hesitated quite a bit to buy yet another router, but the need of customizable Web access control finally won the argument so I got the Netgear. And I am fairly satisfied.Overall:Even without considering the much-better-than-others web access control, which I will discuss in detail below, this router easily ranks among the best. Many strong points altogether make it a top choice.- Dual band operation (simultaneously) at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. This gives you better compatibility, and in the 5 GHz mode, does offer the benefit of less interferences in the radio background, although at a cost of a significantly shorter range.- Very reliable and stable connections. And fast. I don't know why some uses are not satisfied with the speed. This actually approaches 300Mbps speed at close range. Even the laptop used at downstairs can achieve well over 100Mbps. It is important that you not use WEP security mode. Like most other wireless-n devices, this router is not compatible with the old WEP security and would default to 54M maximum speed.- The ability to set up a separate guest account with a different SSID with a different password. If you do have guests who need Wi-Fi, this is a very nice feature because, first, you can have a very easy to remember password for the guest account, and second, you don't need to be concerned that anyone might get onto your network. In reality, the first benefit is more practical. On a number of occasions when I was at other people's places, a much-needed guest access to Wi-Fi couldn't be easily had because the host couldn't remember the password. The family computers were set up a long time ago, so it is quite common that the password is either forgotten, or not known by everyone in the house.- Easy setup and reliable access to control. This is one of the routers that you can reliably access by directly connecting a computer to the router using an Ethernet cable without having to manually set an IP address of the computer in the TCP settings of the network connections. This is so important for straightforward router setting up and management. You just plug in the cable, open a browser and enter the right IP address or URL of the router (preferably bookmarked on your browser), and you are in control of the router. You don't need to run any CDs or software. You can access the router anytime without any assistance. So simple and predictable. Strangely enough, most routers do not have this seemingly simple ability (Note: I'm talking about accessing non-configured router to configure it here. Once the router is configured, of course, you should be able to access its control through any computer connected to it. That is a given on all routers today.)  The other routers would require you to manually set the IP address of the computer to be in the same IP address range (subnet) in order to access the router before the router is configured, unless you take the trouble of running a proprietary setup software, which of course you usually don't have with you unless it is the first time you have opened the box to install it. And even if you somehow manage to find the CD, running the software implies a complicated process in which many things can go wrong, and that's one of the reasons why people complain about routers so much in general.- The radio range is comparable to the SMC, which is very good. It covers a two-story home with signal strength over 50% every corner.- Unlike the D-Link, the Netgear runs very cool.- The black box is also the best looking router I've seen. Also, I appreciate the fact that it doesn't have antennas sticking out.- And lastly, the Live Parental Control offered by Netgear with OpenDNS. The Netgear router's own built-in net access control has nothing worth mentioning, completely unusable like you would find in most other routers.  The Live Parental Control has quite a lot to like and is the first ever Web access control that I feel is usable. It is still far from being perfect by any standard, but this is many times better than the best built-in access control in any router I've ever seen, and the only one that is actually usable in my opinion.This is the reason why I abandoned the extremely reliable SMC and bought the Netgear.  But I'm only partially satisfied. I don't regret buying it, as it really achieved some of the goals I had. But there is a lot of room for improvement. I will discuss this major feature separately below.Live Parental Control:When it comes to web access control, it is not in a 'anything-is-better-than-nothing' category. If it is not good enough, you just don't want to use it, because you would mess up you and your family's Internet life. My experience with the previous routers was unbelievably frustrating, not because the setting up was difficult (it was), but because the overall design was terribly bad and essentially incompetent without exception.There are three different types of approaches to web access control. The first is local computer-based using software installed on the local computer; the second is router-based using router programming to allow centralized control over all computers in the same LAN; and the third is server-based service (typically for subscriptions) to allow easy remote access. Netgear uses an interesting'blend of all these three approaches, and based on my experience I think they are onto something. If implemented well, they would be able to offer the best in the world.Live Parental Control is easily the best I have seen so far that is offered free along with a router. I have not used the subscription-based solutions offered by other companies because I believe fundamentally the right way to do this is at the router level.To use Live Parental Control, you create a user account at opendns.com. The account is associated with your router. A management utility program needs to be installed on a computer for basic management. But for full control of the account, you need to log on to the web-based account. Each account is given a main account with customizable filtration levels. This is the default filtration on any computer that is connected to the same'router. The filtration levels are based on selection of more than 50 categories. I found the filtration to be very effective. In addition, the user may also grade a'blacklist and a whitelist of websites.What really makes Live Parental Control unique is its use of bypass user accounts which function as modifiers on top of the default filtration. You may create a bypass user account for each individual. The filtration of the individual account is customizable just like the main account. You install a user utility program on a computer, and if the user logs onto the bypass account, the filtration settings of the bypass account overwrites that of the default main account. This is a great design that allows a great deal of flexibility.The 'bypass account' feature is easy to set up for each individual user (family members) to have customized web access with multiple and flexible time schedules. Yes, not only does each user have his own schedule, but also each user may have multiple time slots scheduled for customizable filtration settings. This is far better than the scheduling capability of access controls built in the routers.Note that the management utility program needs to be installed on only one computer that is used for management of the network, but the user utility program needs to be installed on every computer in order for the bypass account to work on each computer.However, as it stands now, Live Parental Control is still far from being perfect. It still has some basic problems with the design concept, and I don't know what all these product architects and programmers are thinking.In the following, I'll identify several major problems, which can all be solved quite easily once they recognize the problems.(1) Still has sadly inflexible time schedules. On the first blush, the thing seemingly allows a great deal of customization in time schedules, both in the default account and individual user accounts. But a slightly deeper look shows that all time schedules without exception are recurring daily schedules. There is no provision of a weekly schedule for different weekdays and weekend, and there is also no provision of a single time (nonrecurring) schedule. Why? Is it so difficult to realize people's lives don't run according to a fixed mechanical clock every day? Certainly I don't think it is difficult to program it once they realize the need for such flexibility (or reality, I would say). I must say that I'm disappointed, although this is overall far better than the previous ones I used because at least it allows easy setup for individual users.(2) The 'bypass account' feature works only on computers, not on other devices such as game consoles. You can't install a bypass account on a game counsel such as Wii, or an Internet TV box. So these devices will always be operating according to whatever you set up in the default account. Then again, this is only an imperfection of a fairly usable solution. Other guys don't even have a meaningful solution on this yet.(3) The bypass account feature does not work with a wireless bridge in combination with the router. I tried Live Parental Control on a Netgear Rangemax WNDR3700 Router in combination with a NETGEAR Access Point/Bridge WNHDE111. To my disappointment, although the bypass user accounts would work well on computers that directly connect to the router, but don't work on computers that connect through the bridge to the router. The default settings work through the entire network. But the bypass accounts simply don't have any effect on computers that are connected to the bridge. Yes, I was certain that the user utility software was properly installed and the user account was logged on. In fact, I did some test by connecting the same computer directly to the router and found that the bypass account would immediately start to work. But once the direct connecting is cut and the computer is put back to connect through the bridge, the bypass account would immediately stop working. This is rather disappointing. I eventually had to take the computers off the bridge and used wireless adapters on each computer to do the work. The bridge ended up connecting to print servers only, greatly limiting its potential use.Overall, this is good progress, but still has much to be desired. I think the market desperately needs a web access control system that meets the needs of today's families. So far, I haven't seen one. Netgear's Live Parental Control come pretty close, and I think if they would only read my review, they would realize that it doesn't take that much for them to improve this vastly, because fundamentally they are on the right platform.",,,

Was unable to get enough signal strength to go 200 ft.  Very disappointing.  Could not find a distance specification in the documentation.  A RangeMax it is not.  I even bought a second router to set up as a repeater.  Still could not get sufficient range from the pair.I attempted to set up the guest network.  Was disappointed in the functionality of that, since it did not support several of the encryption options.After extensive testing, I returned the second unit and decided to keep the first one.  I gave up on the extended network, and am just using the router for an upgrade to my local network.  The basic functions of the router do work satisfactorily and the two of my computers that have 'Gigabit' capability do exchange data much faster.  The Wireless N interface works great, too.I also hooked a 1TB external drive to the router for data sharing.

Today was the day, I believe the router went haywire, multiple reboots, endlessly re-establishing connections, it was nuts - not good in a busy vet clinic using one simple database program. Ended up having to swap out the router to a (NetGear) switch from the host - will see tomorrow if this resolves today's awful issues - I have a feeling it will. Incidentally, I updated the router's firmware and it behaved even worse following that little jaunt.I chose NetGear products because, over many years, they have worked reliably and lasted a fairly long time (as in, never actually had an issue before). Frankly I don't really care for Cisco products, all promise - hopefully NetGear isn't choosing the same path.

Just an update to my below review and I'll try to be brief. I've had this router for a few months now and pretty much everything I said in my review has to be modified for the worse except the setup. The ready share function often is not ready at all.  A connected drive only appears visible on the network for about two days max and the you don't see it.  I have found most video streaming I do on the Internet experiences non stop buffeting when using the 5ghz channel with the wndrs so called video streaming algorithm enabled, which is supposed to improve HD video playback. The 2.4ghz network does not have that feature, but I seem to get much better video playback using 2.4 for some reason.  I do not have any 5ghz interference in my neighborhood, but have tons of 2.4, and the signal strength is full-on (at least that is consistent), so I don't see why I am not getting better performance. Even with better performance at 2.4 it still gives buffering, just not as much at 5ghz (it's practically unwatchable). My joy with this router is starting to turn to frustration.Original review:Ok, I just bought this router last night. I normally wouldn't write a review so quickly until I had a product for awhile, but this has me excited.  IT has been on my mind ever since it came out and I just went out and decided to buy since the price has dropped by $40 and fell right into my purchasing sweeetspot.  This may sound weird, but this thing looks sexy to me.  It's sleek and just looks like it going to hit you with power, so kudos to the designers.  I love it.  Like most routers these days it comes with a quick setup CD. What I liked about this one though, unlike some of the others that come with the CD, is the startup guide also prominently displays the access path if you want to set it up manually.  I recently setup a wireless router for my father (he bought an entry level Belkin which was perfect for his needs..pretty good router too in that space) and it had a quick start CD, but no info on how to setup manually and it would be hard to figure out if you didn't know what you were doing.  I've done a bunch of them so I knew how to get it, but I could just imagine my father trying to figure that out, but I guess that's why they have the quick start CD! Anyway, I chose to setup my 3700 manually, not because I think I'm a tech god or anything, I just like to see everything that the router can do and get familiar with its feature set from the start.  This thing is pretty loaded with features.  So in that department I am satisfied.  The items I like: it can host 4 networks simultaneously, it can be used as a media server (haven't tried this yet), can be used host attached storage via the usb port (was messing around with that last night.ummmm), it has long range!!!  You can adjust the signal strength and monitor bandwidth usage.  You can update the firmware directly from the router!!  Speaking of which, it needed an immediate firmware update because the one that shipped had a bug that would turn off the antennaes when a guest network was enabled, but no worries, it was corrected in the update.  Generally I like everything about this router in terms of what it can do.  The problem, and the big 'but' in my title is that not everything executes as smoothly as I would have expected.The first nagging issue I encountered is that the router toggles the antennas off and on whenever you apply certain configuration changes.  This is not much of an issue on initial setup since you are connect via ethernet, but you may have issues if you access the config wirelessly because iyou may lose the connection.  On my laptop that was not much of an issue because it would eventually reconnect (but it takes awhile, so the issue is speed there).  However, this morning I made a change from my iPAd (I have to tell you it was pretty cool to be able to configure this from a touch screen. It was an unexpected and surprising experience actually!)  The issue here had nothing to do with the wndr though.  The iPad frequently drops wifi or won't automatically reconnect to known networks (apple needs to fix this asap or the device is a useless hinderance to productivity), so when the wndr resets the antennas, the ipad does not reconnect, so it will sit on the 'please wait' screen because the session is broken.  The plus side is that the settings took (mac addr addition), but i wouldn't recommend doing any substantial changes wirelessly. One, its just quicker doing it wired (albeit inconvenient) and two, you don't want to risk screwing things up while it writes the change to flash (not saying that is a confirmed issue, just a practice not to disturb a write operation from experience programming large Cisco routers and switches in the past as part of my job at that tine).  So for now I'll just have to give up making config changes quickly. The router I replaced was wrt54gs and I did config changes wirelessly all the time because my wife was always buying some new wireless gadget so I constantly adding to the network.  The linksys did not reset the antennas for those kind of changes though.  Despite the inconvenience of having to do it wired, the wndr has a pretty cool feature that will make adding some of my wife's devices a breeze.  When adding a device to the access list, if it is a PC and has acquired an ip address from the router, it will automatically create a list of the computer names and mac addresses and make them available for selection.  So you can add multiple devices in one go. This is an improvement over my old linksys because I had to add them one at a time and it didn't have friendly names associated with the mac addresses, so after awhile I couldn't tell what device was which (had over 30 mac addresses).  I found non-pc device had to be entered manually.The second nagging issue I had was with the attached storage feature that they brand as 'readyshare'.  It is a cool feature that allows you to connect a usb storage device to the router and make the storage available to your network.  It works as  advertised, but i ran into a small hiccup that took several hours for me to figure out.  The default setting allows you to access the storage via the path \\readyshare.  Enter it Windows explorer and the contents of the drive appears. Simple.  If you enable the password feature, it will prompt for the password and then display the files.  The wndr allows you to edit the name used to access the attached storage. I took them up on the option since I don't like leaving in the default settings.  Afterward I could no longer authenticate and gain access to the drive.  It kept saying 'access denied' even before I had the opportunity to enter the password (this is on Windows 7 by the way, so this behavior may be exclusive to 7). To make a long story short, it basically came down to the facet that it wouldn't work if any name other than 'readyshare' was used.  Changed it back to 'readyshare' it worked fine. Changed to anything else, it would automatically pass forward my windows logon which is why I was getting access denied even before entering any credentials in the prompts.  Weird indeed.  I did a search and stumbled on a FAQ for the wndr at Netgear that discussed this very issue, but whatever they were saying was the issue made zero logical sense and didn't work (they recommended logon/log off and/or reboot and said the cause was due to using two different authorisation methods and that it was a Windows problem--I was using admin auth on both setttings and reboot logon/logoff did not remedy the issue). Not convinced it is a windows problem, but using the default name 'readyshare' worked and any other name didn't--so it seems more like the router not acknowledging the new name so Windows then assumes it is another resource on the network.  That is just speculation though.  So again, just be aware of this if you happen to run into the same thing.  You might not.  In the end the feature does work and that is all the matters. It would be different if it were completely not functioning.With that said, despite the above nags, I am very impressed with this router feature set and performance thus far.  I definitely would recommend it to everyone.Even my father. :)",,,

I had no problem in setting up the router initially, but when I set up Guest network access, the wireless radio was disabled for all SSIDs.  The only way to get it back was to do a hard reset and set up the router again.  Then, when trying to enable the Guest network again, the wireless again went down.  I spent a lot of time trouble shooting, including updating firmware, but to no avail.I returned the first router, and purchased a second from a different vendor, only to have the very same problem.  I called Netgear's technical support line.  After 40 minutes on hold, they 'escalated' my call immediately to a higher level tech.  She then had me download a beta version firmware update, Version 1.0.4.66, which is not yet posted on the web site.  This firmware update immediately fixed the problem, and I now have a stable Guest network running alongside the regular wireless SSIDs- the principal reason I upgraded to this router.So, five stars for the router, one star to Netgear for shipping it with such a huge bug.

Unfortunately, the router firmware is pretty bad. Activating features such as traffic monitoring or the DLNA media server cause the router to lock up. These are apparently 'known issues' to Netgear, however there is no ETA for fixes to either of these issues. Also, I am surprised at the very basic level of configuration provided in the admin tools. It lacks even basic port remapping which even most $30 routers have. As a concrete example of why this is important: With my previous Linksys router I allowed remote desktop connections to come in, but on a different port to reduce the chance of an attacker finding it and trying to break in. I can't do that with this router. I am really hoping a third-party firmware comes out soon that works on this router.",,,

After a bunch of testing and frustration with the lack of support (it was out of warranty at this point) I began looking at other Wireless routers.[...] provided a weatlth of useful comparison information on the newer routers on the market and the Netgear WNDR3700 was at the top of the list.Hardware spec wise this router is at the top of the heap and the dual band spec. N radios is a nice feature. I haven't been able to use the 5 Ghz band yet since I don't have a suitable wireless adapter but the 2.5 Ghz band has very good range and throughput and I haven't had any dropout problems like I did with the DIR-655 even after switching to the Ralink drivers and wireless manager.The WNDR3700 setup very easily with a Win7x64 Pro system and was very easy to configure. It offers WPA2 for wireless security and I was up and running under 5 minutes of turning it on.To make this easy to configure Netgear went to far in the direction of simplicity. What keeps this from being a great router is the lack of customization options in the user interface. The DIR-655 had a multitude of more advanced options and was highly configurable while the Netgear doesn't even allow me to change the default user login name (admin) which isn't great for security.If you are looking for a wireless router that has great hardware performance and is easy to setup and use this is a great product.

Even though I can only get data from my broadband router just so fast, the router seems to be effortlessly routing everything in my network without any slowdowns.  Unfortunately, I didn't get any range improvement in one area of my house and my main laptop is still around -60db (and about 1 MB/s)  I was hoping to get a little more but the faster router processor seems to keep the data flowing very steadily.  If I use a USB network adapter on my laptop, I get full speed.  I suppose I could blame my laptop network card for a weak antenna.As for the 5GHZ secondary band, I didn't find any use for it.  If I got further than 30 feet from the router and had any obstructions, the signal was just about useless.  I was -90db at 40 feet thru one wall and the ROKU XR failed to hook up.

Tech support said that the problem was (a) my USB drive was not on the rather small approved list and (b) the external power supply of a USB drive conflicts with the power on the router's USB port... that's an interesting spin... especially since disabling media server seems to have resolved the problem.So, given the high price of this router, I'd say 'average'.

I have mixed opinions on it so far.Setup was a hassle.  The wizard did not work, as I didn't have the latest version of flash.  It did not offer to install it from the cd, and as I had unplugged the old router, I had no internet to download it.  So I did the manual setup.  As I mentioned I was replacing another Netgear router, the web interface is essentially identical.  However, the software locked up constantly, in both Firefox and IE.  When I added a MAC address, lock; view the logs, lock; and so it went...  It would not connect to the internet until I did a full reset of my modem, not just unplug it like that manual recommended.Once it was finally setup things work ok.  The power plug seems to be a little loose, I knocked it out easily moving the router a couple of inches...

Then it stopped working last week (June) which was outside the return window. I then did some research and realized that I had received an older version (v3). Version 4 has a Qualcomm Atheros AR9344 processor running at 560 MHz which is faster than the Broadcom BCM4718A (480 MHz) processor that was in version 3. The RAM is bumped up to 128 MB from 64 MB as well. The reviews on v4 are positive so I am rating this as okay, but Netgear and Amazon should sell each version separately. The model number listed should be WNDR3700v4 or WNDR3700v3 to make this clear.

I am capable of troubleshooting equipment and have a strong opinion based upon my experience.That being said, I have had this for about 2 years, but it is at its end of life. I kept up on the firmware and everything was fine until about 2 months ago. The wifi would stop working. The SSID would stop broadcasting, although the wired connections would still stay operational. However, when the wifi would cut out, the USB drive attached to it would become unavailable. On top of that, when it was in this state, I was not able to log into the router to check and see if it detected anything. A reset would correct the issue, and everything would be fine. At first it started to occur every week, then every few days, and now it happens 3-6 times a day. This is a hassle for me as I use my network drive to stream movies and music to my tv. I just upgraded the firmware to the latest version again today, with no success.When it worked, it was great. I was VERY skeptical about buying a Netgear, as when I worked customer support at my ISP it seemed that Netgear was consistently the brand of router (varying models of course) that had the most issues. I had a small, entry level Linksys that only did G wireless for almost 7 years before it died. I paid $60 bucks for it, and although it had no frills, it lasted FOREVER. I put a lot of thought into this model, and was convinced by a co worker who said it was a really good bang for your buck. At the time, I think I paid almost $160 bucks for it, and it only lasted a few years. I would not recommend purchasing a Netgear router again.

Based upon my experience with this product I felt compelled to provide my basic review. It might be fine for you but for me I have my own subjective concerns.Upgrade Reason -Originally had a Netgear 814V2 and needed to upgrade due to faster ISP service. Needed a gigabyte connection to my desktop to obtain the benefit of increased ISP bandwith. Note that you need to have a high speed Ethernet card if you want to obtain maximum benefit of increased ISP bandwidth. Some people may not know that.GUI -Upgraded to newest firmware release which changed the GUI from the older (IMO better) GUI. There was no option to keep the old interface. Downgraded to what you see below. Spoke to Tech Support and they said that they will contact engineering so they can consider putting an option in the next release.  I liked the old interface but that is my personal preference.WNDR3700 -Firmware:Hardware Version  WNDR3700v3Firmware Version  V1.0.0.18_1.0.14GUI Language Version  V1.0.0.18_2.1.13.1IP Range -The 814v2 had an IP range beginning with 192.168.0This one starts at 192.168.1I have an HP 5000n printer with an IP of 192.168.0.71. I could not connect my printer. Tech support said that is because of the beginning range of the router IP addresses. Now I have to (if I don't return it) to figure out how to change my HP printer IP address to 192.168.1.71.At times when you save settings in the GUI it take a long time and it loses connection to the router and it's brutal to get that connection back sometimes having to do a reset. Sorry, I can't be more specific and I apologize. Called Tech support and they had me reset the router to the connection back to the new router.Logging -There are a lot of options to review logs but its missing sites visited as there was on the 814v2. I like to see a record of sites visited and sites blocked by URL/DNS name. Example if [...] was visited it would in my 814v2 show that site name in the log. If I blocked facebook then I want to see blocked [...] for example. Again, this was available on my old router. This type of logging is not available on this router not even with the Genie interface. I consider this a step backward. If you know of specific software that will allow me to see this type of log maybe I can live with this router.Wireless -No problems. Fast and reliable so far. I use Access Control and do no broadcast the SSID. Connected to Dell Laptop, iPhones and Itouch no problem. Super easy. I have a small house so I cannot provide an opinion on range.Tech Support -I had almost no wait time and the Technical Rep. was excellent. I had Eric from the Philippines and he was outstanding. He was patient and honest. This is the type of person you want to work with. He will get an outstanding review.If anyone knows of a GB router I might consider replacing this with please let me know based upon my above concerns. Unfortunately, at this time I am going to return this router.",,,

I have a Canon MX870 that is connected via WiFi.  When I turn it on, the device shows up on the router, but after a while, it just disappears.  Can't print again without resetting the printer.  I've seen similar behavior with other wireless devices.The devices continue to work, and can access the network even after they've been 'forgotten', but you just can't really find them on your own.It appears that accesses to the network initiated by the devices themselves (such as playing music, downloading a video, whatever) work fine, but you have trouble initiating a connection to the device (ie, trying to print a document to the network printer) because it just doesn't really know where to send it.",,,

The range is quite good as well; I have the router on the first floor and have a good connection on the second floor and in the basement and garage.  However, in the past few months I've noticed issues with the connection, mostly to the high speed.  Suddenly the high speed connection gets lost on my iPhone and iPad, and sometimes both connections disappear (My new TWC modem also has WiFi built in, so sometimes I notice that my wireless devices are connected to that instead of the router).  I recall that with my iPhone 5 there was no problem with the connection, and when I went to Netgear's website they have a notice that says'Wi-Fi issues with iOS 6There have been widespread reports of wireless connection and speed problems with devices using Apple's newly-released iOS 6 connecting to NETGEAR products. The problems that you are experiencing may be due to a recent upgrade of the Apple iOS 6.  While the nature and extent of the iOS 6 and Wi-Fi connectivity issues are unknown, NETGEAR will do our best to continue to monitor the updates from Apple and continue to work with our customers to ensure that we can help provide support and work-arounds (when possible) to get your devices connect properly.In the mean time, please check out the following websites and forums discussions for additional updates and information regarding this Wi-Fi issues between your Apple iOS 6 devices and NETGEAR wireless devices:'It's nice to know that I'm not going crazy, because I kept restarting the router to try and fix the problem, but it doesn't seem like they are too concerned with the issue.  The upgrade was a number of months ago; if they cared about the customers I would think they would work with Apple to address the issue and not just 'monitor' the situation.  The connection seems quite good with other items I have that use a wireless connection (Roku, Sony bluray player) and the wired connection seems solid as well, but considering that I use my iPhone and iPad constantly for work it's a bit of a deal breaker.  If Netgear doesn't fix the situation, I'm upgrading to the Western Digital router which seems pretty awesome (they were at NYCC and the sales pitch was pretty good).  If you don't have any Apple devices (or are using an older iOS), then this is a good choice for you.  Just remembered, I sometimes use the wireless connection on my Mac mini and that worked fine as well.

2181,XX,B002HWRJY4,3,6,8,21-Oct-12,A1ATZIWBFOBYT7,Very good router but has its flaws (READ FOR A SOULUTION TO FIX FLAWS),"Bought this unit about two weeks ago, setup was very hassle free, and not a lot of tech knowledge was needed for the original setup.  Router ran great unbelievable speeds, both wireless and wired, but after a couple of hours I started dropping connection, and would have to reset the router to get it back up.  For a couple of days I tried my own troubleshooting, and googleing for a solution, and came up empty handed (apparently a lot of people have this issue but have not figured it out).  So I made the dreded call to netgear, where I was received by a man who had a heavy accent, and not communication skills.  After hanging up on him due to the communication issues, he called back and asked me to hold so he can transfer me to an engineer (woo-hoo another guy who has no idea about the unit, except what he reads out of his manual, or gets from another engineer).  After three hours of doing everything I have already done on my own they decided the unit was defective, and wanted me to send it in to amazon for a replacement.  Gut check time, to send in and get a replacement or get a refund.  I was so impressed with the unit when it did work I decided to chance it and get the replacement.  A couple of days later the replacement arrived, I hooked it up , and this time instead of setting the whole network up I just hooked one computer to it, to test if it had the same problem.  So I ran the unit for 48hrs, and no disconnects, and I began to hook everything back up.  A couple of hours later dropped connection.  So I had a hunch that something on the network was killing the unit, and I started testing everything by disconnecting one device at a time and running until it died again.  Final I found the culprit, it was my 3tb Seagate Go-Flex hard drive that was being shared through the ready share feature.  So to continue this I decided to see if it was the drive itself or if it was the ready shard functions.  I test several hard drives, that were freshly formatted, and ranged from different sizes, did not have the problem on any of them.  So in conclusion what I believe the flaw is with this unit that Netgear has not discovered at this time is that you must reformat your hard drive before you attach it, I have since reformatted the seagate, and slowly started putting everything back on it, (I am currently putting data on it now), and it has ran non-stop for 48hrs, and I have put almost everything back on it.  So if you plan on using the media share function make sure you format the drive, and you should not have a problem.  Unit is a very good unit, very fast and very user friendly, and for the price it is untouchable, with the information that I have giving you.  If the unit did not have this flaw, or if someone was kind enough to figure this out before I bought it, I would give it a 5 star rating, but considering the time I placed into figuring out the problem, and hoops I had to jump through I can only give it a three star rating.",,,

2385,XX,B002HWRJY4,3,1,1,14-Jul-12,A1BLQ0VO6UIGEC,"A beast of a router, but not customizable","The specs on this router are very good, especially for the low price point.  I bought it with the intention of putting DD-WRT on it, but I also had hope that I wouldn't need to.  Recent routers I purchased from Cisco/Linksys actually run a stripped down version of DD-WRT, so I was hoping Netgear would do something similar.Unfortunately, no.  The Netgear router interface is very basic.  It worked out of the box as expected, but its feature set was extremely basic.  A basic feature I was looking for was the ability to assign static DHCP leases to specific machines on my network.  The Netgear doesn't have this feature.  It doesn't have a number of other common advanced features, either.  If I was buying this router for my parents or a basic Internet user, it'd be great, but for user with more advanced needs, it's lacking compared to the combination.Like I said, though, I planned to replace the stock Netgear firmware with DD-WRT to get those advanced features.  The v3 WNDR3700 has a newer chipset that DD-WRT does not yet support (and as of this time, no ETA is given) and so that router I received would not even work for that.  If you're considering this for a DD-WRT-based router, realize that you'll need to look elsewhere for an older v1 or v2 model of this router.  Amazon does not print part or version numbers for this hardware, so you can't tell what you will get, but they'll likely ship you the newest hardware revision.So, in the end, it's a great router if you don't want to do anything advanced with it.  For the very short time I had it running, I had no problems.  Don't consider this router, though, if you want to run an alternate firmware or are looking for a router with more advanced features.",,,

Saddening when it comes to Music and Movies. If I purchased it for any other reason, it would get 4/5 stars.",,,

They're always been courteous to me and they seem to try hard. Well, that past experience was shattered with this router. Router was shipped just fine, packaged just fine, hooked up just fine, and then the software configuration is where the problem started. Even though I'd upgraded to the latest version, the software screen did not match the instructions on their website. So for instance I went to Netgear's tech support, entered the exact model number of my unit and it would say 1) do this, 2) do that, etc but what they were saying did not match the software screens at their web page driven configuration. So calling tech support I explained all I wanted to do was change the login password for the network from 'password' which is the default to my own password. This was like something new to them, the gal tried to help me and then moved me to an upper tier tech support person who was one unhappy camper, he was surly and short tempered, and just plain nasty. I really didn't care, so I went through it step by step with him and we couldn't do it either. I finally had an friend of mine who's a network pro come over and he showed me how it's done in 60 seconds. I showed him the discrepancies between what they said to do and the screens I had to work with, and he said he sees this all the time.So far it's running just great but their tech support made me want to pull my hair out. I worry about older Americans like my parents who have to call and deal with these tech support people that are so angry and hateful.",,,

It only last one and half year. I paid $150 for it. It is really short lived. For a router at this price range, I expect it would last longer. I have to bring out my old Linksys WRT54G that never die. My previous one before WNDR3700 is Linksys WRT310N,which is a nightmare. It has overheat and dropping connection problem.Beside short lived, this router performance is good. It does not drop connection at all. It happened once or twice in one and half year. The range of 2.4GHz is good. I get strong signal in my bed room closet that is at the other end of the house that WRT54G had trouble. The 5GHz channel is short. At half of the distance of my house, signal drops to half. After that, signal drops quick.Overall, it is a good unit with short live.  It absolutely does not worth $150. At current price range around $100, you can decide. I do not think it even worth that as you need to shop another one pretty soon.",,,

Netgear advertizes this feature as allowing one to 'Wirelessly access and share USB hard drives'.  If this is a feature you wish to use, be very careful to track down Netgear's list of compatable devices and make sure the precice USB storage device you have is as supported. For example, because Netgear includes the Seagate 2TB Free Agent GoFlex Desk 3.5inch as a compatable device, I thought it was fairly safe to assume that the 3TB Seagate GoFlex Desk 3.5 inch drive should work. It does not, and a call to Netgear support confirmed that there is no work around such as formating a smaller partition. I was simply told that if its not on the list as supported, it will not work.",,,

Nice being able to setup a guest network temporarily when we have a bunch of family in town for the holidays.  Also really like the fact that I can reduce the power output of the radios to save a little bit of power.  I walked around the house with my tablet that has a signal strength check program on it to make sure I had adequate signal strength after turning down the power on the 2.4ghz band.  What I really like is that I just hooked up an external USB drive to it and put all of our music library on it as variable bit rate mp3s.

Still need to get that v2 router to test.ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS:Was expecting v2 router, received v3. v3 uses a Broadcom chip, as opposed to Atheros, rendering it (currently) incompatible with custom firmwares, a la DD-WRT, OpenWRT, Tomato, etc.Flash memory is halved, relative to the previous version, from 16 MB to 8 MB.Lacks features I deem essential in a $99+ router: Static DHCP, (Used to ensure that devices will always get the same IP address whenever they try to get a new IP address.) and bandwidth meters.

I have experience working with Enterprise Cisco routers as well as home/office routers. I purchased the 3700 solely for the 5gz signal. The lower band is crowded in my neighborhood, and there is no one broadcasting on the upper band. I set up the router manually and was disappointed in the lack of manual controls. The router sits about 15 feet from my laptop with no obstructions. I know that you can set up with custom firmware, but did not go this route. Using multiple settings, updated firmware, more than one laptop, and searching various forums I could not get the 5gz to hold a steady signal. I could see the signal oscillating slightly using software made for that purpose. Unfortuneately, this was enough to cause the transmissions to constantly fluctuate between 150 and 270. The lower band was always solid.I have an older MIMO Trendnet 2.4 only router that I was replacing, and I used it to compare signals and rates. It would sometimes fluctuate between 150 and 300, but it is competing with 5 to 6 of my neighbors operating in the same range.Maybe I got a dud, but I'm not willing to take a chance on a replacement; will be boxing for return to Amazon as soon as I finish this review. My next choice will probablly be one of the Cisco/Linksys routers, but since several articles rated the 3700 highly, I thought I would give it a try.",,,

This model appears to have better features than the WNDR3700, and is similar to the WNDR3800; plus special support for Mac. I have a MBP so I liked it at first look. On Amazon I got it for $85, which is cheaper than 3700 model. All the features that WNDR3700 offer are already part of WNDRMac. Below are the features 3700 doesn't seem to have which are in WNDRMac model. The one I received is WNDRMacV2 which has very similar hardware config as WNDR3800. (As a matter of fact, WNDRMac is much closer to WNDR3800, only missing things are the firmware features like ClearChannel Selector, Tivo compatability etc).Features in WNDRMac which are not in WNDR3700:- Rapidshare USB Printer support- Genie dashboard control- Video Mode- Time Machine compatible- CD-less install (not that it really matters)To my surprise, WNDRMac model nicely worked with an externally powered USB drive! From several reviews and user comments, the 3700/3800 models did not seem to work with a USB drive which was externally powered. It uses Bonjour for the Printers - so connecting printer should not be as difficult as other models (Bonjour can be installed on Windows as well).Overall, I feel WNDRMac has more features than WNDR3700 (much closer to WNDR3800), plus closer to Mac and works well with PCs - with lesser cost than either of those models.",,,

As far as I recall, no reboots, or maybe one for an unrelated reason. I am raising my rating from one star to three stars. It would have been four if I wouldn't have had to go through all of this hassle to get it to work right. Netgear should have left well enough alone with firmware v1.0.4.55NA and hardware version 1.UPDATE 2011/11/15: Smallnetbuilder dot com stuck with firmware version v1.0.4.55NA according to one of their articles that referenced the WNDR3700v1 test results. That version was still available on Netgear's support site (just click 'show all versions').  I loaded that with the following ritual:Hold reset switch 30 seconds with power on (still 1.0.16.98-dnsNA firmware).  Keep holding, turn power off, hold for 30 seconds while power is off.  Still holding, turn power on. Then turn power off and let go of reset switch and wait 10 seconds. Boot up, leave on for at least two minutes, and do software factory reset (from backup menu in web GUI). Let it reboot. Then upload and install v1.0.4.55NA from web GUI. Then do a software reset again. Then re-upload and install v1.0.4.55NA.  I don't know if all of this is really necessary. It is my compilation of all the posted paranoia out there. Now set up your preferred SSID names, Port Forwards, DHCP range, etc.  I didn't change any of the QOS or WAN settings.  I left NAT as secure. I set up the 2.4GHz radio as G (54Mb/s) with WEP, the 5GHz radio as N single band (130Mb/s), WPA2 Personal AES. You can probably set it up for 300Mb/s (double wide) if you want. Now everything with youtube and IPTV have been fine for about a day.  l already received an RMA number.  But if all goes well for another couple of days, I'll keep the unit. If not and I return it, I will let you know here.The rationale behind the paranoid flash procedure is to make sure that another firmware version's setup (usually a slightly different size when backup-stored, with slightly different options) doesn't corrupt the the new firmware footprint (I guess). I don't know if someone had a rational method of coming up with it (e.g., ex-Netgear engineer with some inside knowledge) or it was just someone's gut feeling.  END OF UPDATE.I searched out a WNDR3700 VERSION 1 because that is the version that got rave reviews at smallnetbuilder.com. [Netgear screwed up the version 2 by skimping on the antenna array.]  I found this 'Refurb' version 1 and thought I had lucked out.  The seller was very helpful in making sure I got the right version.I suspect Netgear takes defective returns, wraps them in new plastic, and labels them 'Refurb,'  and hopes they work or that whatever defect they had would not be noticed by the new buyer.  For some reason, they scratch out the serial number to signal that they won't support their refurbs. Why not? Cisco-Linksys leaves serial numbers on refurbs and give them limited warranties. Or maybe Netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it doesn't know what to do.This router started out looking good but then gradually slowed down to the point that even standard def youtube videos and highly compressed IPTV from Hulu Plus would slow down and freeze or stutter.  I tried at least three versions of firmware and continued to have the same problem (1.0.6.98NA as shipped, and then 1.0.7.98NA, 1.0.4.68NA, and finally the latest 1.0.16.98-dnsNA).  The labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires. What happened to everything between 1.0.7.x and 1.0.16.x for example? And why was 1.0.16.98 label reused for the beta 1.0.16.98-dnsNA instead of calling it 1.0.16.99NA? Also, the auto-update only shows up to 1.0.7.98.The internet is filled with similar complaints about slow downs and freezes, trying various firmwares, and doing various magic spell rituals before upgrading (holding reset button for 10 seconds, or 30 seconds, or doing it twice, unplugging with reset pushed, and so on).  I tried the most burdensome rituals in case there was something to them.Just in case anyone gets one of these, the only way I could get even initial acceptable results in youtube was to change the NAT setting from 'secure' to 'open.' Not so safe.I have applied to return this piece of garbage.  It is back to my old Linksys WRT600n with DD-WRT for now. My only complaint about that dinosaur is that it suddenly looses the 5Ghz wireless connection when streaming a lot of video, probably because of overheating. It is about 3 years old. So I am still looking for a reliable replacement.",,,

When I tried to register the router's serial number it kept rejecting the registration. I got in touch with Netgear customer service who informed me that the product had been registered previously in March and the free 60 day tech support timeframe was up.  Only after you can prove that you recently purchased the product from Amazon will you be provided any set-up or tech support.Do yourself a favor and avoid wasting time on the phone dealing with used routers that were returned 6 months earlier.  If you value your time spend a few dollars more and shop at some place that sells new Netgear products.

Although I've been using Draytek for many years, I decided to keep the costs down for my dad. Even so, $120 is not inexpensive and I had high hopes for this router.Installation and set-up was a breeze. I didn't bother using the 'wizard' but went through everything manually and it was up and running in about 10 minutes.Range was somewhat disappointing compared to my dad's old Draytek 2800G. The Netgear doesn't seem to punch through walls as well and the signal to the guest house on his property -- about 50 feet away, is much poorer than the Draytek. This is true on both the 2.4 and 5GHz bands, although when connected, performance and throughput is fine. The Drayteks have 3 external antennae and the Netgear's are internal. Maybe that's the difference? I've seen no evidence of the Wifi disconnect issues that others have, but I immediately updated to the latest version of firmware when I set the router up.Netgear position the N600 as a high end performance router. Compared to my Draytek 2110n, the feature set is limited. If you need VPN, VLAN, IGMP, or RADIUS capability, more sophisticated NAT, firewall, QoS, or NAT capability, then the Draytek is a much better choice.In conclusion, I think the Netgear will be acceptable, signal coverage issues not withstanding. However in retrospect, I wish I'd spend the extra $20 for the Draytek 2110n.",,,

At the time it was &#34;the best&#34;, it had the greatest range and cutting edge tech.  The router worked excellent, however I will note that my Asus laptop with built in Intel 6200 AGN wireless did take a while to connect to it each time you turned it on (I do not experience that delay with my current router).A few months ago the router started intermittently not connecting to the internet, and sometimes the SSID would not show.  This was easily correctly by unplugging and restarting the router.  Unfortunately for me, the router is in the basement, and this was a pain.  So, I bought a new router.  Actually, two, I purchased a new Asus AC68U.  The range was not as good as with this Netgear WNDR3700.  I did return the router and purchased a TP Link router.  It is decent (and much better priced) but again, the range is no where near what the Netgear had.",,,

Even after several updates to the firmware, the media server still hangs every few hours. Guess it can't handle 5000 songs and videos. After the latest firmware update, at least the NAS works. I plugged in a USB powered drive (Seagate GoFlex) formatted FAT32 and it seems to work fine as a NAS only.Did some further testing and found that for me the N band is no more effective than the G band. I have the router in an adjacent room about 25' from a Nintendo PS3 and Apple AirPort Express Base Station. I set the AirPort to N and used it's Ethernet port on the PS3 during testing. I'm getting around 1.5 to 2.0 megabytes/s transfer rate with both G and N. I tried raising the router and receiving devices up higher (4'-5' above grade), but this made no difference. I'm disappointed in the N band. Perhaps the receiving devices need to be closer, but then what's the point? I can run cables over short distances easily enough.Not sure what the problem is, but next time I think I'll stick with G unless I see reports that N will work better than G in my application.

I am underwhelmed so far with this router, aside from the pretty blinking lights.  The 5Ghz channel is essentially worthless beyond 30 feet in my home, and the 2.4 Ghz ('g') band has no better range than the ancient router it replaced.  It also refused to connect with a fairly new Vizio HDTV for streaming, which was 25 feet away (and one interior wall).  The tv connection finally succeeded after an hour with a helpful Netgear tech rep, during which we had to use the 2.4 Ghz band, lower the security level and lower the transmission mode to only 54 kbps. So much for a high end 'rangemax' router.  Another 45 minutes with Netgear tech support on another day proved of no help in trying to see if the poor range in the 5 Ghz band could be improved -- I was basically told that my wifi adapters on my laptops might be the problem.  This while I sat in a room 40 feet away in direct line of sight to the blinking router, with only 2-bar 'fair' reception on the 5Ghz band, on each of 2 new Dell laptops and a older Toshiba. That is only 1 bar more than I can pick up on a neighbor's 'N' band router signal which is about 100 yards away.  Something is goofy. I will continue to work on it, but I just don't seem to get what the big practical advantage is to these routers if the range can be so poor.  Yes, I know your mileage will vary based on other appliances, interference, walls, etc, but there is a minimum of such things in my home.  On to the forums for help.",,,

However, the many negative reviews it had accumulated gave pause.  I considered other brands but in the end stuck with Netgear, at least in part to avoid the aggravation of learning another user interface.  Having bought it, I should have just plugged it in, logged on, configured it for my network and started working.  But instead I let the supplied Netgear setup and documentation CD lead me through the supposedly idiot-proof setup procedure.  Well, it turns out that the idiot is the programmer who developed the setup procedure.  Here's what happened.First, the setup procedure went through a four-step process to detect my current WGT624 setup.  Worked like a champ -- all OK.  Feeling confident, I let it lead me through the simple task of reconfiguring cables from old router to new.  OK, fine, did that in about 10 seconds.  Then the frustration began.  The next part of the setup was another four-step process wherein the setup program supposedly detects and configures the new WNDR3700 router.  Only it didn't.  At step 3 of 4, the detect-the-new-router step, it hung up. Half an hour later, it was still chugging along, doing who knows what, but certainly not running to completion.  Worse, the little X in the upper right corner that lets the user shut down the setup program was grayed out so I couldn't stop the setup program gracefully.  Time to nuke it with Task Manager (on the app tab, not the process tab, if you're wondering).  That's when things got ugly -- the setup program fought back by freezing my xp machine colder than an iceberg.  Nothing left to do but hold the power button in until the computer shut down -- hardly a polite way to behave.So, restart and now what?  After mulling it over, I decided to give the idiot setup CD another chance.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but it readily found and verified the WNDR3700 in the first stage of the process -- which it surely must have thought was my 'old' router at this point.  Skipping the cable switching part of the setup CD, I proceed to the new router discovery phase.  At this point, I was confident that even the idiot setup program would get it right.  After all, it had just finished verifying the WNDR3700, which was now in the circuit.  Well, not so fast.  After whirring for awhile, it came to a grinding halt and informed me with a smug error message that 'this setup program only works with a WNDR3700 router' (isn't that what it had just verified??) and that what I had in the circuit WASN'T a WNDR3700 (huh?), so I should remove it and put the proper router in place before proceeding!  GRRRR!I guess at this point I would have ripped the cursed thing loose and thrown it out the window except for a bit of serendipity.  I happened to have my smartphone sitting on the table beside me. Amazingly, a message was showing on its display asking me if I wanted to select NETGEAR as my Wi-Fi network.  Finally, as Hercule Poirot might have said, the little gray cells began to catch on.  Sure enough, the WNDR3700 was alive and well despite the setup program's best efforts to hide that fact. I found the setup manual on the CD, located the password and logged on, downloaded the latest firmware, configured the router for my network and it's been running ever since -- no thanks to the Netgear setup program.As far as performance is concerned, the WNDR3700 substantially exceeds the capabilities of its predecessor.  It is located in a back corner on the second floor of a two story house.  With the WGT624 and an older laptop (g-based), signal strength diagonally opposite at the front corner on the first floor was usually two bars out of five.  Now it's five bars.  Can't speak to N-based performance because I don't yet have gear operating in that range.  The user interface is virtually the same as previous versions and is easy to use and to configure.  Good choice there.  But as to the setup program. . .  well, I won't giving that a good rating any time soon.  P.S.  Haven't tried the USB interface and don't intend to; that seems to be a source of some of this unit's problems.  I already own network disks and don't need to network my USBs.",,,

They do sell a dual band USB stick, but i'm not sure it will work with my PS3, or XBOX 360... i wanted this device because of the dual band capability, and the wireless video stream/gaming superiority of the 5GHz over the 2.4GHz, but will have to wait until devices come with this built into their wifi cards (Which you can buy now, but i'm not going to open up the game systems, or my laptop) in the future.

148,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,0,0,26-Mar-11,A13V1370EIXWX3,Very easy to install - hope it lasts longer than my last NetGear!,"Even with the FREE Shipping received the unit in 2 days so my network was not inaccessible for too longThis unit looks pretty slick and sharp with a shiny black finish and a sturdy base to remain standing on a horizontal surface. It has a modern tech look to it.  Can also be installed horizontally on a flat surface on the small rubber pads that are part of the router.  In the back it has an on-off button so that whenever you are done using the router you can turn it off to prevent unwanted hackers from using your internet access.  But of course you should always have it secured with a password to gain access to your network.Right out of the box it was very easy to install and worked right away. I followed the setup wizard and it was painless.  Afterwards, I just logged into the router set-up and further familiarized myself with all the settings possible so now whenever I need to change anything I can easily do it manually and more fine-tuned to my needs.I've only had it for about 1 month and so far so good. My last NetGear router only lasted two years which was disappointing and if it happens again I'm through with Netgear!My only complaint is that I felt it was too expensive compared to other brands of routers, and the lettering corresponding to each light on the router can't be readily read due to the shinny glare and small letters. But I guess you don't need to read each light's nomenclature too often!The network speeds are great for what we need and connection to the internet through a broadband cable modem works great and at fast speeds.",,,

We have multiple devices which link up to this router (Hardwire iMAC, MAC Laptop, multiple DELL laptops, iPODs, iPad, gaming console, etc).  No compatibility problems.  I sometimes think the router belongs to a union; it seems to take a lot of 'rest breaks', but it wakes up after a couple seconds of asking it.  The dual band was not intuitively obvious to set up, but could be my own ignorance in the technology.  All things considered, I would buy this router again in a heartbeat.",,,

My only gripes are a couple of quirky things that, hopefully, I'll iron out in the course of owning this.  I have a PS3 plugged directly into one of the gigabit ports, and I get some strange behavior from streaming video.Hulu Plus shows will randomly skip ahead a couple seconds in the show, causing me to rewind.  It happens 2-3 times in an hour-long show, which is frequent enough to be annoying, but is remedied by rewinding.Netflix doesn't skip, but it does restart an instant streaming show 2-3 times before finally buffering enough to play all the way.  Again, not a huge deal, but a nuisance.Overall though, I'm pretty happy with the router, and I can live with a couple of quirks over issues that I have seen people comment about with the Cisco routers.  I would probably buy it again if given the choice.",,,

Just one less star for the struggle and solution hunting I had to do by myself.",,,
161,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,0,0,9-Mar-11,A1T2EPGRKAIE5S,Works for me!,"I had read many of the reviews online before purchasing this router and was somewhat hesitant to purchase one due to quite a few low opinions of this product.  Having been a netgear user for over 6 years now, I know their products can be hit or miss.  My biggest worry from reading the reviews/issues of this router were the VPN problems that were reported since I use VPN everyday to work from home.I am happy to state that I have yet to have any major (or minor for that fact) issues with this router.  I was able to set it up quickly manually (without the wizard) as I had print screens of my previous netgear routers settings and just plugged them all into the new router.  It took very little time and I was back on the internet.  On thing I did not do however was perform the router upgrade yet.  From the reviews I read, some users had problems once they upgraded the firmware.  Since I have had no issues yet, I am waiting for a newer version of the firmware before I upgrade.  As for VPN, my company uses Juniper and Citrix and I have had no problems connecting and working from home.  I am on 8 hours or more a day (VPN) and have yet to lose the connection as some have reported.The router itself is a good looking piece of hardware, all in black with a stand to have it stand on edge, taking up much less space than my previous one laying flat.  I find the LED's rather subdued myself compared to my last netgear rangemax router with it's 'disco lights' anttenna.  My PC's are all on the 2.4ghz band so I can't comment on the 5.0ghz but I did notice a slight increase in signal strength.  Speed through the wired connection is the same as with the old router.I did purchase an external USB drive from Iomega, although I have yet to set it up with the router.  From what I have heard speeds are very slow but at this point I can't commment on that since I have yet to try it though the router.  I did buy the router for this feature (USB) since Windows 7 has back-up problems writing to my other Iomega USB drive.  I am hopeful that if I can get this one up and running, it may solve that problem by going through the router, we shall see.My only complaint so far about the router is some lack of documentation.  There are two buttons on the front which I cannot find any explanation as to what they do.  I was hoping one would turn off the wireless since I don't need the kids on the net during my work hours eating up bandwidth.In closing, my experience so far with this router has been all good.  I realize I don't use it for all it's features but for a wired/wireless router with USB it works for me.",,,

The Linksys was constantly dropping the connection to our DSL modem or the wireless computers.  Unfortunately the only way to correct that was a hard re-boot. (gets old fast)  Thus far the Netgear has done nothing but work as advertised.  Wish it had a slightly longer range and 1 more USB port but otherwise no complaints.,,,
224,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,2,2,1-Feb-11,A24EMWGLHVO4QD,Outstanding wireless router,"I really like this device - so much that I have recommended it to a number of people.This was purchased based on recommendations from smallnetbuilder (dot com).  The local network throughput is outstanding with very high lan-to-wan speeds (for those with extremely high speed internet connectivity).  Further, the range is just fantastic, and these have just about every bridging and repeating feature that one could ask for.I purchased mine on August, 2010 and have been running it nonstop for the last 7 months without a single hiccup.  I have also deployed these in a number of home-offices, and they work very well.We did run into some trouble with the WPS function, as the Intel WPS client was blowing up some of our custom config.  Further, the router kept on automatically re-enabling WPS.  To resolve this, we switched back to the Windows wireless configuration, which didn't use WPS.Overall, I would highly recommend this device to anyone who requires a fast, reliable wireless router/firewall with very good range.",,,
228,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,0,0,30-Jan-11,A2W597JXE5A53M,A Few Kinks,"I am pretty satisfied with the router, but it does have its problems. The main thing is that it sometimes kicks people off the network when there are about three or more devices on it. One or two will stay connected, but the others will have to reconnect. It's not because we (my father and I) move too far away; we don't even move. It just decides to boot a couple of our devices off now and then. It's not a huge issue, just a little inconvenience. When it is connected though, it works very well. It really helps us get the most out of our comcast high speed connection, which our previous router didn't. It's range is pretty good, which is a big part of why we made this upgrade. The price was a bit high, but well worth the quality. Overall, I'm happy with it and I would recommend this to most anybody.",,,

241,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,10,12,22-Jan-11,A2VDWX2XCWMKX3,Great -- if you're using an opensource firmware,"I was looking for a replacement for my tired old Linksys WRT54G, of which I'd used several for almost ten years. On the recommendation of several friends and positive reviews, I picked up the WNDR3700. Unfortunately, when I purchased it, Netgear had decided to push out a 'v2' model shortly before I purchased, which included a few hardware changes for the better, but the unit shipped with an atrocious firmware. The system was nowhere near stable, and the code was in 'alpha' stage at best. The router would close any open connection after about 2 minutes, meaning that telnet/ssh and numerous games would suddenly disconnect. The interface was atrocious; several elements simply didn't work at all. Netgear barely acknowledged these problems in their support forums and took nearly three months to release a lazy patch that addressed the worst of the problems, but the unit still ran poorly, and the interface left much to be desired.The WNDR3700 had been supported for some time in various opensource projects like DD-WRT and OpenWRT (in fact, Netgear used OpenWRT as a base for their firmware) but with a hardware change between the original and the v2, the newer model wasn't supported, at first, and I had to wait a few more months for a reliable release. As of this writing, OpenWRT has a stable release for this model, including a 'factory installer' that can be used to easily flash the router to OpenWRT by using the default interface, very little muss or fuss.My initial review of this product was rather vitriolic given the then-$130 price tag and the utterly atrocious stock firmware. Since installing OpenWRT, this router has performed fantastically. The difference is night and day. Connections are fast and stable, and the router can handle a large amount of traffic without seizing up or crashing. Perhaps best of all, it's very approachable for a non-techie to use OpenWRT; the 'factory installer' images that allow you to easily install OpenWRT are truly painless and require only a little bit of fiddling within the interface afterwards. For those more technically-inclined, a very feature-rich hardware platform awaits your exploring and experimenting.One of the best features of this hardware platform is its full VLAN control and multiple SSID support, which makes possible several more-complex access control rules. For instance, my primary network covers one SSID and all gigabit ports on the router itself, all stations sharing an IP pool. The secondary or guest network is only served via wireless on a differend SSID/passkey, is not bridged to the physical ports (except WAN), and uses a separate IP pool from the primary network. This means you can supply a guest network with internet access, but without the ability to see any network shares or other machines on the private network. Netgear supplied this type of functionality with the stock firmware, but it's execution left much to be desired; with OpenWRT, it's a bit more involved to configure this setup, but it also gives you much greater control. Anyone with Linux sysadmin experience and a bit of google-fu could knock out just such a configuration.Overall, I give this unit 4/5 stars, mostly due to the rather abysmal firmware and support provided by Netgear. While the hardware is great, the stock firmware has left much to be desired. I recommend this for anyone with a moderate-to-high level of skill, someone who doesn't mind getting their fingers dirty with tinkering. Despite my initial misgivings (not to mention the stress headaches from the first two months stuck only with the initial firmware), I could scarcely be happier with its performance lately.",,,
245,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,4,4,18-Jan-11,A1ESF3CHOPS3IH,Perfect replacement for my old LinkSys,"I purchased this wireless router to replace my aging LinkSys router purchased almost 10 years ago when I was still in college. That router was a champ but age (and the 20+ networks within range of my condo) were catching up with it. Long story short, I was in need of a replacement and did my research.This router, and the brand as a whole, was highly recommended by several sources. I'm a technologist by trade, so I rely on recommendations from friends and colleagues. I also scour the Internet for independent ratings and reviews. This Netgear was at the top of the list.Things I love:- Ability to broadcast multiple SSIDs for different network protocols and guest networks. I have frequent visitors who use my network and it's nice to now give them Internet access only and not access to the rest of my personal network.- Antenna power throttling. This is great! I don't want to have my entire neighborhood see my wireless access point, so I can provide less power and keep the signal close. On the other hand, I might be fighting for coverage in the densely populated area, so it's good to boost power. I like the control!- Automatic channel selection. On the old router, as people would move in and out, the network channels would become cluttered and empty out in different ranges. I'd have to manually adjust this on the old router when I was getting a lot of interference and noise. This Netgear does it automatically and seamlessly. Nice touch!- USB to plug in an external hard drive. This is an awesome feature and I no longer have to move my external backup drive around with the laptop as I move from room to room. Plug it into the router and voila; I have NAS! If I map the drive, however, I've found that it won't always connect immediately if I restart my computer. Minor annoyance and most likely due to my own configuration. I'll fix this later.Things I like:- The user interface in the admin pages is nice. Not the prettiest I've ever seen, but wonderfully usable. It's easy to figure out the admin pages without so much as a glance at the help guide.- No external antenna. Call me old fashioned, but I'm usually dubious about devices like this not having external antennas. Netgear has done it right, though, and I have absolutely no signal issues (even in my dense condo) and there's now nothing for the cats to chew on, or me to bump out of place. I'm a convert to antenna-less devices!- The thing is just pretty. It's a slick looking box and looks good sitting on the desk. I usually don't care about it, but it's actually worth mentioning here.Things I don't like:- I paid $150 for it. A little steep, but it's actually worth it. As I write this review I see it's $20 less. That would be a little easier to swallow.- Uhm... that's it.In conclusion, I love this router. I felt sad letting the old Linksys go, but this new router is so awesome that I quickly got over parting with my old college buddy! If you're thinking it might be time for an upgrade, do yourself a favor and look into this router. I believe you'd be hard pressed to find better.",,,

350,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,7,8,13-Nov-10,A34R2Q3FU4AUHW,Good with a major flaw,"I have purchased and installed several of these routers. If you are planning on using one of them as a simple router, it is a great device; powerful, reliable, great range and lots of features, including the ability to enable/disable the 2.4 or 5Ghz spectrums, as well as enable/disable a separate guest network.The interface is pretty clean and easy to use, and I like that you can have the device check for firmware updates itself right through the configuration interface; no need to go to the manufacturer's website, figure out exactly which model and hardware revision you have, manually download the file, manually upload it to the router, etc. etc.Updating the device firmware on this Netgear router is far easier than with most other brands, as the router handles it all itself and defaults to checking for updated firmware every time you login to the device, which is nice, and can be disabled if you need to frequently login to the device.Speaking of firmware, that brings us to our big, gaping flaw and the reason I only gave this device a four-star rating:The repeat function absolutely does not work. Do NOT plan on purchasing two of these routers with the intent of using one as a base station and the other as a repeater to extend the range of your wireless network, because as of Nov. 2010, there is a firmware bug that simply doesn't allow this feature to work.After driving myself insane messing with it, I did some research online and on Netgear's support forums, it is clear that there's a known bug that prevents the repeat function from working.This has gone unresolved for months - I don't recall the exact dates of all the threads I read, but Netgear, through their support forums, has been aware of the issue for many months and still no new firmware, at least not as of Nov. 2010.That's a real shame as Netgear is one of the only companies whose networking products I trust, the other being Linksys/Cisco.I do hope they will address this big issue very quickly, as this seems to be their flagship consumer router.Anyhow, again, if you are looking for a single, simple router, this guy is great, just don't plan on buying a twin to use to extend the range of your network, as it won't work. If you need to do that, Apple's Airport actually does that quite well.",,,

I have not had a chance to stream a movie or something but I have hooked up a thumb drive and have no speed access issues there. * Edit - see comments - no printer support.The biggest upgrade for me was not having this router hang all the time as my Linksys and Belkin cheaper models had. I consider this top of line personal router and lower range commercial. In other words this should be a good unit for a small business.",,,

I have some network experience so set up was routine; I just copied my hand written configs to the new unit and was setup in about an hour. I did not have any issues with the box not doing what its supposed to do. Now for the down side; everytime I save a category page of settings, the router takes a long time (30-40 seconds) to reboot. This is really nothing to complain about because it does not affect the performance, but if you are trying to plow thru the setup to get online and working, this is a major speed bump.The wireless performance I believe is good, I'm in a 3 level townhome 1800 sq feet (wood & stucco construction) and it works fine in all areas. As distance increases speed goes down. My speeds on the 5 Ghz band was at 120 M-bit rate while downstairs on the 2nd level. The router is on the 3rd level, highest in elevation so I believe its well placed. Most wireless performance is dictated by many external variables, such as distance, interference, transmit power, obstructions, and the laws of physics. So given all of these variables, I am satisfied with the router's performance.  Wireless technology and innovation will continue improve over time so this probably won't be my last purchase.One problem noted when used with the Silicon Dust HD Homerun streaming wireless to a laptop, the video at times breaks up or crashes. This is an IRD that outputs IP video for use with SageTV or a Snapstream PVR setup.  The problem is probably that the HD Homerun is not designed for wireless uses. Its happy on a wired LAN.  With my other video servers (Ready-NAS raid), the wireless works fine and is transparent. I could not tell the difference between wired and wireless. The IP video was wireless streaming to VLC player on my laptop with out any noticeable freeze frames. that data rate was around 19 M-bits/s continuous, recorded tansport streams from HDTV off air recordings.I ultimately bought this router based on the write up in the Dec 2010 issue of MaximumPC magazine. It earned a 9 rating. The router at the time of my review is working and meets all of my expectations.",,,

However, I recently noticed that I was getting increasingly poor pings to any servers I connected to (Team Fortress 2), regardless of when I tried.  I confirmed this by pinging Google: 'ping -t google.com' showed constant, massive fluctuations in response time, ranging from sub-20ms (normal) to 500+ ms.  I eventually traced the problems back to the WNDR3700: connecting my PC directly to the cable modem solved the problem, and while erasing the WNDR3700's firmware and restoring the saved settings cleared up the problem temporarily, the latency/lag issues returned within a few hours.Upon calling Netgear's customer service, I was told that I would have to contact the store I purchased my router from to get a new replacement.  Otherwise, Netgear said they would only send me a refurbished device as a replacement, since they did not ship new devices via RMAs.  This is despite the fact that the online store I purchased from (not Amazon) only offered replacements within 30 days.  I eventually got them to comply with my request for a new-unit replacement, but not before telling them that if they didn't I'd dispute the charges through my credit card & use the funds to purchase a competing product (ConsumerSearch.com recommended the Linksys WRT610N).In summary, the WNDR3700 is a great product -- if nothing goes wrong.  However, I shouldn't have to browbeat the company whose product I'm purchasing for support.  Defective hardware is a fact of life, and I was surprised that getting a new replacement was an issue at all, considering I'd had less trouble getting a new replacement for a $60 8-port GS108 ProSafe switch, which cost almost $100 less.  That's the only reason this was a four-star review, instead of five.",,,

Installation was SUPER easy and hassle free. I would have given this router 5 stars, but my wife and I found one flaw with it - it interferes with our baby monitor. If you are not a parent to any young ones, this obviously won't be an issue for you. But if you are, just keep that in mind.This router has made our baby monitor virtually unusable due to the static coming from it now. We didn't have this problem with our previous router, so we're going to try and tweak the router settings a bit and see if the problem goes away. Until then, I give it 3.5 stars.",,,

After 8 months of use I can only relate to what we have or what we have experienced so far with this router. Our set-up consist of 3 computers ( 1 wireless the other two haed hooked directly) a wireless blu ray player ( for Netflix ) and a wireless Logitec squeezbox player upstairs. I intended this router for our daughters wirelss laptop (64bit) that she recieved for Christmas but then have since added additional items to it. At first we had a few troubles to get the laptop to hook up to the router but after an update and a call to Netgear service all worked out good, but it does time to time drop a signal to her laptop. Netflix on the LG bluray player for the most part works great, it does once in awhile seem to stream at a lower rate and then boost back up. It connection to the squeezebox has no trouble at all. Now take in mind, the 'drops', 'slow rate' or conection lost may be do to the other devices ( in which they are most likley ) but I would at least throw that in, nothing is perfect. At the most ( the area with the squeezebox player ) has 3 bearing walls to go through as 40ft would be the distance. The other items have the same if not a bit less. So far I am very pleased with this router as it has performed as I had expected it too. This router has a very good range, mostly dependable as it would offer most anything you can add to it. Worth the monet I would say!",,,

472,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,0,0,23-Jul-10,A16SB2LQZBZAY6,Consistent with the reviews,"At first I was a bit hesitant to order this router, mostly because of the negative comments in the reviews.  But after my current 5+ year-old Netgear router dropped my VPN connection for the umpteenth time I decided to take the plunge.I shouldn't have waited as long as I did...it was simple to install and configure.  Sure, I had to download the latest firmware before I could successfully configure my guest networks - but once that was done, I was able to complete the configuration through the web interface.  I didn't bother with the installation CD, since I already had experience with the web interface with my old Netgear.The only thing that I had a problem with, was getting the 300Mb/s link on my 5GHz band.  After a bit of searching on the 'Net with Google, I found out that you can't get 300Mb/s with PSK.  Once I changed to AES, the wifi on my laptop indicated a 300Mb/s - cool!The router does run a little hot, but since I have it on end using the supplied stand it doesn't seem to be a problem.  Granted it's only been a couple of weeks in use, but (knock on wood) so far, so good!And did I mention the cool look of the different colored blinky lights?Haven't tried QoS or traffic monitoring, so can't comment on that.  But overall I'm quite satisfied with this product and would readily recommend to anyone.  I still have older 100Mb/s wired and wireless-g equipment, neither of which makes use of the 1Gb/s wired or 300Mb/s wireless capabilities, but as the old stuff ages and gets replaced...this router will be ready to support the next generation equipment on my LAN.",,,
473,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,0,5,23-Jul-10,A2JF6IREXYM6HE,Great range but doesn't work with firewalls,"If have a firewall on your computer, don't buy a Netgear router.  The internet won't work for more than a few seconds, if at all.  I unfortunately didn't learn this until after I'd bought my second router from them.  The first died after about three years when it was fried by a power surge caused by our electricity coming back on after an outage.  I've always used heavy-duty surge protectors, so I couldn't believe that killed it.  Nothing had ever happened to anything before.I kept thinking my problem had something to do with my firewall settings, so I talked to their tech support many times and changed several settings without success.  They told me their firewall (Zone Alarm Internet Security Suite) hardly ever has problems with routers, so I finally decided to call Netgear.  A bit to my surprise, they admitted that their routers generally don't work very well with firewalls, so they tell their customers to turn them off before going online.  They're working on the issue and hope to have it solved someday, so I should keep checking for firmware updates.  Kind of unbelievable if you ask me.  Why should I have to turn off my firewall and lose my protection?  If other people in my house didn't rely on the router for internet access, I get a different one in a second.As of 1/3/11:I recently bought a new Dell XPS 9100 that came with a McAfee firewall, and as bad as the router worked with my old computer, it works just as well now.  I guess it depends on what firewall you have, but NetGear tech support really dropped the ball by telling me their units don't work with them in general.",,,

But as many have said, the USB is slow for hard-drives. This is one of the reasons I bought this in the first place. I could have spent a lot less on an asus that's hackable, and after putting up with the poor performance of the USB I kind of regret spending the money.

However, it could help you a lot if you have the n-band wireless cards on your devices to support transfer of media or large or streaming files from one PC to another.Setup was not difficult, but then I have not had any problems with my netgear hardware with any wireless card. My netgear routers have always worked well (except due to lightning strikes -- completely out of their or my control).Bottom line - worth your consideration if you are looking for a dual-band wireless and wired router.",,,

I've been a long time advocate of linksys and making the transition to Netgear was a leap of faith. Thankfully, I was not disappointed. I'm familiar with setting up wireless networks and was not afraid to go through the painful process of setting up each wireless device to work with the router, however, I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to add devices to this router. Just a simple press of a button and the required wireless security information is quickly transferred over to the new device and your connected. Once the connection is made, I was extremely impressed with the overall range. The main selling point for me was the range and the addition of a usb storage device. This device has been criticized for the speed of the USB port, however, I have had no issues using the port for a central storage device for pictures and music. I'm not sure I'd recommend it for storing movies or for watching movies directly off the drive.Overall, I've been very happy with the performance and would recommend it. The dual band range is limited, but unless your looking to stream HD movies it shouldn't be a concern.",,,
522,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,1,1,30-May-10,A2M01JQO4QRDM3,"Good router, but with some issues","For those of you who want a nice dual-band class N router, this is a great little piece of gear.  It was easy to install and set up, and it has a wireless setup and wireless startup and shutdown button which is useful if you do not want wireless on all the time.  The web-based setup utility is second to none in features and control, and is easier to use and understand than my previous Linksys.Some of the features, however, do have issues and I have to admit that Netgear does not seem fast to correct them.The USB network storage capability is ok (not better than that though) if you just want a network drive without sharing from your PC.  It is on the slow side - but then again, I haven't seen one that wasn't.  Netgear does include a media server function... but unless the amount of media files you have is fairly low (I'd say 100 GB tops), this feature can cause problems.  I have a 1.6 TB external drive connected to the router - it has about a 800 GB of media on it - a combination of audio and video files.  The router attempted to index these for the built in media server, and this promptly caused the router to lock up.  Resetting the router always brought it back online, but it kept freezing whenever the drive was connected and the router was attempting to index the files.  I checked with Netgear - the solution?  Turn off the media server as it cannot index more than so many files.  This will be fixed in the next firmware fix.  This is May 29th 2010 when I checked this, BTW.  I checked their forums and saw that this has been a known issue since at least as far back as September 30th 2009 - and there have been firmware updates since then which apparently have NOT resolved this issue.  Not good, Netgear.I haven't tried the 'guest' network function, but reportedly (and in these reviews) there are issues there as well.So I have mixed feelings about this router.  As a dual-N rooter, it is solid and fast, and has some nice features to it.  If that's what you're looking for, fear not - this is a good device.  However, if you want to use the built-in media server or guest network functions, before you buy check to see if these issues have been resolved - if not, there may be better options for you.",,,

534,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,1,1,20-May-10,A29MTVFDJQE54E,"Does the job, after a bit of configuration","I bought this router to replace a Linksys WRT54G running dd-wrt, with the specific aim of improving the wireless signal from the router (upstairs) to my Xbox 360 (downstairs). The Linksys performed adequately for laptops used downstairs, but the signal to the Xbox (using a Linksys WGA54G game adapter) had always been poor and unreliable, especially bad for streaming Netflix over Xbox Live.Setup of the WNDR3700 was quite easy, but I was quickly disappointed to find that the N signal was still extremely poor at the Xbox (now using a Microsoft Wireless-N game adapter), fluctuating constantly between one and three (out of four) bars. Repositioning the wireless adapter using a USB extension cable didn't seem to help. The G signal, however, was extremely strong--noticeably stronger than the Linksys router had been. The Microsoft adapter is dual-band, so I figured it would not be the end of the world if I had to use the Xbox with the G network. (I was mildly irritated because I could've bought a much cheaper Wireless-G router, but oh well.)It was suggested on the Netgear forum to lay the router flat (rather vertically, on its stand) to better reach clients on different floors--allegedly to get a better 'spread' of the signal--and also to configure the N network to use a higher channel than the default. I did both of these, and it did indeed seem to help a lot--now getting four out of four bars on the Xbox (after repositioning the wireless adapter a bit). Multiplayer and Netflix streaming have been working perfectly so far.It's only been a week, so it's a bit early to rate the reliability, and I haven't tried using the USB storage feature. If it continues to perform as it is now, however, I'll be quite happy with the WNDR3700.",,,

I swore off buying Netgear routers with the old rounded badly ventilated cases many years ago after going through several different series.  In contrast, this one uses a new case design, runs cool, and has been reliable after several months use.  Setup was OK- typical Netgear.  The power plug can come loose and does not snap in.  The 2.4Ghz signal is great going through 3 plaster walls and around a large fridge. I can't say as much for the 5Ghz (maybe 15ft).  The same 40 ft distance from router  to bedroom 'o!play' sucks at 5Ghz, but works great at 2.4G via a Buffalo N-adapter.  The laptop connection at rear of house always says 300Mbps, and O!PLAY-R1 multimedia player video/audio performs without any problems.  My wired desktop surfs super-fast via the gigabit ports.

However, be careful if you have an iPhone 3GS - Netgear and Apple are not working well together on that device.  My iPhone 3GS always has an EXTREMELY slow WiFi connection on WNDR3700, with bandwidth consistently under 300 kbps.  My old iPhone 3G however always reaches more than tenfold speeds on the same router.  Because of an unrelated hardware problem on the new iPhone I tried many things, even resetting the network settings, restoring the phone from backup and setting it up as new, and none of these steps fixed the slow wireless access problem.  Ultimately, Apple replaced my 3GS because of a touchscreen failure and the replacement unit still has the same exact issue.  In addition, I had the same exact problem between the iPhone 3GS and my old Netgear WPN824v3 router.  Consequentially, when I'm at home I just disable my iPhone's WiFi because it's much faster on 3G.There are some posts online from people with similar troubles and their fix was to set the Fragmentation Length to 2304 (or 1024) and CTS/RTS Threshold to 2305 (or 1500) under Netgear's advanced wireless settings.  Some people also suggested changing the channel to 11 (I'm unaware of their affiliation with the Spinal Tap band).  Although some users reported great results after applying some or all of these changes, I systematically applied all of the recommended settings in different possible combinations on both my Netgear routers without any significant improvement in WiFi performance of my iPhone 3GS.  The only way to resolve this on my old WPN824v3 Netgear is to disable g mode and stick to b only.  However, WNDR3700 doesn't offer an option to disable g and n and use the router in a b-only mode.  Netgear tech support wasn't helpful at all, stating that since my router works with other WiFi devices (laptops and PS3) that I should call Apple, in spite of my positive experience with its performance with other wireless routers (Cisco wireless at work and Linksys at my sisters where its bandwidth consistently reaches above 10 Mbps and works just fine).  Since both Netgear and Apple keep playing the finger-pointing game, I feel betrayed by both. My recommendation is to stay away from Netgear wireless gear if you already own an iPhone 3GS, or to stay away from buying an iPhone 3GS if you already own this router (iPad might have similar problems as I've seen some early reports about WiFi issues).  Other than that:Pros:- Dual radios, configurable for separate home and guest SSIDs on each band (a/n on 5 GHz and b/g/n on 2.4 GHz)- Guest SSIDs can be configured either for internet-only or with access to the entire home network- USB storage port can use an external HDD or a flash drive for home network storage without much trouble.- USB is configurable for internal and optional external http and ftp access in addition to standard Microsoft Networks share (for that one you need to set up your Netgear router, laptops and desktops to the same network/workgroup name in order to see the storage on your local network).Cons/suggestions to Netgear for improvement:- Inability to run 802.11b only- Inability to change beacon interval settings- Shared USB storage can't have more than two accounts - admin and guest.  Admin is stuck with the same password as on your router's admin account and guest with no password. I expected more granular storage space administration capabilities- Problems with iPhone 3Gs",,,

There are many variables that will determine this, (walls, nic card etc) in my case tt works well around the house, I cant go out side or into the basement.If they made this where I could attach an external antenna, that would be great, in fact I might just take it apart and do some soldering...all in all good router..

The first call was with a tech who did not speak english very well and the second call was received from a tech who knew his stuff and was easy to understand.  Still, it took him an hour and fourty minutes to get everything going just right.The product does works well and I am pleased with it, however, if I need any tech support after my warranty period runs out, I will be in trouble.",,,

So got this and everything works like a charm.The only annoying piece about this was the installer couldn't run on vista and vista 64 so had to go borrow a laptop with Win XP on it. Once installed it has been the best 200 bucks i have ever spent. Not a single drop in coverage and get the full 300 MB all over the house. My netflix movies plays instantly and gets the HD bar always. Havent even reset the router once that is impressive. I am sold on this piece of hardware.Thanks Netgear hopefully you will get the installer fixed soon.,,,
637,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,1,2,12-Feb-10,A1AZ6VA0APW6UM,Rangemax WNDR3700,"The main reason for buying this product was in the hopes of getting a more stable connection.  Previous networking hardware was about 5 yrs old. Well, we not only got a very stable connection, but we got a much faster one as well.  You get a stable connection in two ways.  You can connect within the 2.4 Ghz freq, OR within the 5.0 Ghz freq.  So if one isn't connecting at that fast a speed or is having trouble connecting the other freq does connect (our 5ghz freq wouldn't connect after a snow storm, but the 2.4 Ghz did connect).  speed of connection has ranged from 300Mps down to 264Mps (your mileage may vary).  Still it's much better than the typical 52Mps from a 5 yr old network card and router.  So I would definitely give this hardware a thumbs up.",,,

Clicked on 'try again' and no problems.We have a Asus netbook (1mb ram) with a n band and Sype video call works better. In fact even this laptop (g band) I write you from seems better. We are also considering a skype phone, so we got this unit.I read quite a bit about new router. Decided on this one. Bought at best buy because wanted right away and we have silver RZ which gives a 12% discount. Otherwise would buy it here. I went there to pick up this unit but ended up asking the best buy guy just in case. He pointed to this one and a cisco one 20 bucks more. He said he has seen very few of the cisco returned and none of these. But he said both were good. the ones returned were usually the lower end ones...Only thing I don't know is that I asked me during installation to name the two wirelles (2.4 and 5 ghz) I named them the basically the same with a '2' and a '5' in the end of the names. But both of our computers as well as the wireless printer we have only found the one with the '2'... not sure if this is something with our stuff or I'm not having the '5' wireless network. If somebody knows please leave us a comment.Anyway, wanted something in the upper end. We got it. I'm not the geek guy. To me it's working so far.

This product splits my lower speed wireless printer which runs on 2.4ghz and my pc's running on 5ghz (otherwise, without Dualband, my pc's would have been reduced to the slowest common denominator speed).The product was reasonably easy to setup, it did take a few passes through the installation software but nothing I haven't experienced before.  Setup took a little over an hour.  I've done multiple wireless routers from other manufacturers and have had to use their tech support.  I did not with this one.Also, it replaces a LinkSys product that I had for a month which kept needing to be reset/rebooted when the connection would drop...and even then the pc's would not pick up again.

I have had this router for a couple of months and it has performed flawlessly with the exception the media sever feature for the external hard drive.  Netgear recently release a firmware upgrade to address this issue but it still is not working when the external hard drive contains a lot of media files as I have.  I hope Netgear addresses this issue in a future firmware upgrade.  By the way, if you do enable 'media server' on this router with a lot of media files, the router will lock up and thus far, the only way to fix it is to reboot the router.  Other than the aforementioned media server issue, I would highly recommend this router!",,,
657,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,0,1,25-Jan-10,A2GUYP6JAB558V,Great Router,Now that everything is hooked up I love this router.  The range and strength of signal are a vast improvement over my old Linksys G.  Setup was fairly straightforward and my new computers and game systems were up and running in about 30 min.  Two of my older computers would not connect to the wifi signal.  Many hours of internet research and a phone call to Netgear later and I was told that my old wifi adapters could not keep up and would need to be replaced with a new Netgear USB adapter. (I still might do this just to get the faster N signal). I later figured out that my wifi adapters just needed to get updated drivers.  If you have older equipment update your drivers first to save the hassle.,,,

I also didn't want to pay for the insane price of the DroboShare.  This was the latest N Dual Band router, had some good reviews, so I purchased it.I got the router up and running with no problems, but it locked up shortly after connecting my Drobo to it.  I did some quick research and found out that if your attached USB device has many many files, the index of the files may be too big for the 'Media Server' functionality, and it will cause the router to lock up.  After rebooting and disabling the 'Media Server' feature, the router has been rock solid.  I have had no lockups in 4 months, which is a record for me.A new firmware just came out for the router which supposedly fixes this issue, but I haven't tested it yet:[...]Note that the USB speed will not blow you away with this router, and I have had to plug it into my computer directly at times when doing things like photo editing due to poor performance.  But for doing things like streaming music and viewing photos it works just fine.It's the best router I have owned so far.",,,

I did a bunch of research before purchasing this router. I made sure that all the features that I wanted were included in this router. Overall, this router is pretty good, however there are some cons that go along with it.Pros: Stylish with the black lacquer finishN-wireless router (allows you to have a faster transfer rate of signal than G or A routers)Easy to set up (just called the customer service rep and they are very helpful and make the setup job feel like a piece of cake)Multiple functions that allow you to choose whether or not you want to share your wirless signal with other peopleAllows you to delegating the amount of signal you want for certain devices (i.e. I am a gamer so I want more of the signal going to my Xbox 360, than my computer, when I am playing a video game.)Cons:My landlord lives right up stairs from me. Yet he can not get a strong signal. This is the big downfall that this router has because it claims that it has AMAZING SIGNAL STRENGTH THAT REACHES FAR! But it really does not. He still only gets 1 bar wireless and has to plug directly in and only gets 2 bars. So in this case...the distance is not good. But the range is okay atleast from 10 feet.",,,
681,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,1,4,25-Dec-09,APFBMDI5TJ8MQ,So far pretty good,I bought one of these about 2 weeks ago.  It was easy to set up and so far all the features work.  I have only ised it wireless. I haven't attached an external HD to  the USB port or tried the gigabit ethernet.The only problem I have noticed is that my connection  speed frequently drops from 54 to 24 Mb for a computer in the same room 15 feet away.  I don't lose my connection but when I check my speed it does fluctuate.  I have never been dropped by the router.  I am not sure that the issue is not with my computer  (it is 4 1/2 years old) but I have been too lazy to check with my wife's (It is newer) from the same location.Overall I would say that this is a pretty good router and I think that when I  get aroud to setting up my desktops and adding gigabit  cards to them that it will prove more usefull.,,,
684,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,5,6,20-Dec-09,ATPOJO4IRA66W,"Great performance, no printer sharing","I bought this router to replace my old TrendNET (which replaced a Dlink) router.The problem with the old router was I didn't get enough speed, and I have a lot of data going internally in my home between computers. Any router that does 802.11 N and is not dual-band is basically a joke. If you have any wifi-enabled phone (iPhone, Android, etc), then it won't work with 802.11 N. So you will have to put the router in compatibility mode with b/g, so you will never get the 'N' speeds you paid for. So if you want 'N', buy a dual band router (like this one :) ).The router, once installed and set up, is a solid performer. I don't remember exactly, but I think that the CD that came with it was useless and buggy, so just install it using the web interface.I used to get ~1-2 MBPS on my old router (transfering files internally within my home network), and it went up to 7-8 MBPS with this one. Also, as this is dual band, the N and G networks are completely separate so the iPhone doesn't slow down my laptop.I have not tried the file sharing part, but at this price, I will totally expect to get printer sharing. It is competing with the Apple Airport router, which is pretty solid too.",,,
689,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,0,1,16-Dec-09,AK4PSHDMN5HXY,Setup Wizard on the Cd doesn't support Vista 64 bit.,"I got this router because the reviews were good. The Setup Wizard on the enclosed CD doesn't support Vista 64 bit. I spent 45 minutes on the Netgear support site and found it confusing. The link to download the latest CD was busted. There is a firmware update (that supports 64 bit) but I couldn't find a download for a compatible setup wizard. I don't feel like going through a manual setup so I'm returning the item. It's probably a good router; I'm just put off by Netgear.Addendum: I may have been too hasty writing the above. I decided to keep the router and try a manual setup. It was easy (see: WNDR3700_SM_28May09.pdf). The firmware updated nearly automatically and the setup wizard could be run from the router once the basic hardwire connection was made. I'm getting a good wireless connection on a laptop located several rooms away from the router. I haven't tried streaming anything yet. Also, see the comment and reference (much appreciated) submitted by Ulises.Update: 1/25/2010. I still have the router and am quite pleased. I have a four split-level house and am streaming Netflix diagonally from one far corner of the house to the other. Previouly I used a power line connection which proved erratic. I'm getting an excellent picture (with no buffering) streaming to an Insignia Blue Ray player with built in Wi-Fi. The connection to my X-Box works well also.",,,
699,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,0,1,3-Dec-09,A1BVKJNA0SI8UU,Very happy with my purchase,Just received the router yesterday.  Setup was extremely easy.  The only issue I had was when I went through setup it kept saying it couldn't connect with my cable modem.  Since my machine was hardwired into the modem I just opened up a web browser to connect to the internet.  Then went through setup and all worked well.  The CD it comes with is easy to follow - they really show you every step.  We got a new modem because connectivity was intermittent.  We bought a new Blue Ray dvd player and the Netflix feature wouldn't work.  Now with the new router it works great - very fast.  And our Roku in the other room is faster too.  Worth the money - easy to setup and increased performance - just what we wanted.,,,
720,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,3,4,27-Nov-09,A29NGKH4C8M46L,Great Router but range lesser than expected,"Bought this device about two weeks ago.  Setup was a snap.  I consider myself a medium-advanced user.  This unit replaced a Linksys Wrt54GS wireless G gateway router.  What I have enjoyed about the new router:  (1) gigabit speed on my home network, (2) the guest network capabilities on both 2.4 and 5.0 Ghz, (3) the ability to connect wirelessly on a 2.4 Ghz and 5.0 Ghz simultaneously.  I also enjoy the automatic firmware update on the device.  Whenever you access the setup port (192.186.1.1), it automatically checks to see if there is a firmware update and will download it and install it automatically if you allow.  My only disappointment with the router is that I can not consistently use the wireless signal in my bedroom, which happens to be the furthest point in my house from the router (3100 ft).  I can use it there occassionally, it depends on weather, atmosphere, etc.  I was surprised that my range actually decreased from the version 1 WRT54GS I had previously, but that device had two small antennas and this one has none.  Overall, I am very pleased with the device and recommend it.  Caveat, until a wireless N repeater is available, it may not meet your range requirements.",,,

But to play a little devil's advocate here it was not advertised to either. I logged into the router with no problem and manually configured it with ease.

The install cd will not work on 64 bit systems so be forewarned (since this is newly introduced I am surprised it doesn't work with the 64 bit). I had trouble installing it at first, my main computer is 64 bit so I tried another wired computer and it couldn't find the signal at all. So I did the web address [...] and it could see my network but wouldn't connect to the internet so I had to do a reset of my cable modem and when it got done flashing it's lights I was connected. It would have been nice to have some written instructions with this, it is to all be on the cd. Luckily I had printed some information before I tried to install this.I wish it was easier to do the security stuff also, I am new to this stuff and I have to search a lot for how to set up the security, print out pages.. I live in an area that isn't heavily populated so I can get away with the WPA security which seems to be the easiest to set up. It take a few minutes for the router to connect to the internet also if you pause the cable modem then come back and want online again, my other one was almost instant. So far I haven't experienced any dropped connections but I haven't had it long either (that was the problem I had with my other one).I have tried about 3 or 4 new linksys routers lately and just couldn't get them to connect to the internet at all, at least with this one I was able to get connected to the internet without too much trouble.For those newbies out there like me try resetting you cable modem if you can't get connected to the internet, I learned that in trying to get the linksys to work but even that trick didn't do the job with them?This is a little pricey but it seems to deliver the speed and the install isn't too bad so to me it is worth it.",,,

They offer dual band Wireless-N, they offer guest access, a usb port for hooking up hard drives, etc.  The good news is that this router seems to be a step away from the netgear of the past (where I would try to avoid their products) and into something that's mostly worthwhile.The router performs mostly up to task, some reviews have issues with wireless-n speeds, and while I'm not seeing the full potentially of wireless-n, it could be something in my setup as well, and it's faster than the wireless-N 2.4ghz (non-dual band) that I was previously using.  The other feature is bandwidth monitoring, which with the advent of metered broadband, is a great idea.  However it seems to reset randomly, and have some other issues, hopefully in a firmware update this will be rectified.This is a solid netgear router, with only a few small drawbacks.  If you're a mac user I'd recommend still going for the Airport Extreme, but Windows usually should definitely take a look here.",,,
745,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,153,176,9-Oct-09,ABC68JUCPTVOE,"Feature rich, high-performance wireless router","This high-end wireless router by Netgear is well-designed and comes with a lot of features out of the box.  I loved the ability to skip the 'insert this CD rom in your computer' installation for dummies method and go straight to the web GUI to set it up.  The feature I was most interested in is the USB storage sharing.  This feature allows you to plug in any external USB drive, and then share it over the network.  This was a convenient target for pushing automatic backups to.  If our computer's hard drive catches on fire, I still have backups that I've saved on the USB drive attached to this router.  Unfortunately, I ran into a bug when trying out this feature.  Netgear support was helpful, however, and helped me get it working in a day.Pros:- Feature rich, high-performance.- Nice vertical stand included.- USB storage feature turns your external drive into a network share.- Comes with QoS (a must for VOIP), dynamic DNS, firewall, features.- Easy to upgrade the firmware and it will automatically check for updates.- Good documentation.- Dead-simple installation and you can skip the Insert This CD-ROM install method.- Ability to set up 'guest' network with separate settings in addition to your main network.Cons:- Traffic bandwidth monitoring is rudimentary. It is actually very good for an off-the shelf router, but I'm spoiled by my home router which runs Tomato firmware: it has pretty graphs.- USB storage feature needs work.  You can only use your router's admin password to protect your shares.  Configuring settings with Google Chrome or non-firefox, non-IE browsers may silently fail (as it did for me).  The workaround is to reapply settings with IE or Firefox.All in all a very solid product.  I give it 4.5 stars, as I wasted time chasing down the Chrome/Web GUI bug.  I have no doubt this will become a 5-star product as Netgear pushes out new firmware updates.",,,

Netgear still won't support Wake-On-Lan,"The RangeMax WNDR3700 has an excellent range and sends signal much further than D-Link DGL-4500 that I had before. The RangeMax WNDR3700 supports simultaneous dual-band Wireless-N providing twice the bandwidth with better connection and less interference, and that shows.With NetGear RangeMax WNDR3700, it is possible to create a dedicated video network in 5 GHz band for streaming high-quality HD video, while letting guests to use 2.4 GHz at the same time, making it possible to share internet connection without comprimising the security of the local network.One item that disappoints me with RangeMax WNDR3700 is that it does not support Wake-On-Lan from the internet. Specifically, Netgear has disabled in the firwmare the ability to forward UDP packets to x.x.x.255 IP address. Why they've done that on purpose is beyond understandable.Other than issue with WOL, the RangeMax WNDR3700 is overall an excellent router for both advanced and novice users, providing easy to use interface, excellent range and QoS monitoring for those times when an extra bandwith is needed for specific applications.",,,
765,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,11,14,12-Sep-09,A2XWTEHG7VJCE5,Was the long wait for this router worth it?,"I have been waiting for this router to come out and it is finally here after the many delays. This router has all the bells and whistles which any gamer or computer tech savvy guy or gal would want. It is fast and has an excellent signal which can be adjusted on both 5ghz and 2.4ghz to save money on the electric bill if you want. There are so many settings you can mess around with, to optimize the performance for your needs. This router is a must for those of us who live in an apartment building with a lot of wireless networks in the building and a lot of wireless devices to go off of your network. I have a ps3, xbox 360, wii , two iphones, psp and macbook pro connected to my wireless network with no drops yet. Games and other downloads on my game systems seem to download faster. Videos on the Internet like youtube are playing simultaneously with very little buffering or none at all on my Macbook pro. It also has an Internet traffic counter to let you know how many gbs you are downloading every month. Which is key especially with Internet providers like Comcast who is going to start having a 250gb cap on the Internet every month starting in October. I can go on and on about this router because of all it has. There is one big problem for me though. I was under the impression that this router would have usb printer support so you can share your usb printer throughout your network but once I tried to hook up my printer it was a no go. I am very disappointed about this because I was looking forward to have both an external harddrive and my usb printer on my network. One more thing that bothers me is it is a finger print magnet like the ps3 but other then that I would highly recommend this router.Update:After a week of using this router I ran into a problem with the traffic meter. The traffic meter does not seem to be very accurate. I check it every day and it seems to reset itself every day or every couple of days instead of once a month like it is suppose to do. Today for instants I checked the traffic status add it says I used 1385 mbs this month so far and yesterday it said 3234 mbs used. This is not right because the total mbs used should be higher today not smaller. This is quite annoying because this feature is one of the reasons why I bought the router and it does not work right. I have the most up to date firmware so it is not a out of date firmware problem. I just hope Netgear fixes this problem before next month because Comcast is going to start using caps every month and it sure would be nice to have this tool working right, by then.",,,

I currently have an Ooma device connected to my cable mode. This wireless router connected directly to the Ooma device. The installation documentation comes in a CD and is really basic. Once you have plugged everything in, you can just use a web browser to access the router. The first thing it does is to look for any firmware updates which means you have to wait for a little bit before being able to access the control panel. You can configure it later so that it doesn't check for updates every time. The address used to access the device is routerlogin.net. This, however, I've noticed doesn't always work. Sometimes it brings me to my router's control panel, sometimes (most of the times) it takes me to [...] instead. I can ping the [...] address and it does resolve to 192.168.1.1 so it is the router the one that is redirecting the connection there. You can always type the default IP address, however.The control panel provides detailed help on the right side so you know what each option is for. I like the fact that you can name devices in your IP address reservations and MAC filtering so that you remember which devices they were. Applying any changes does take some time.I haven't had any problems with the range. I'm operating at 2.4GHz and it works just great.",,,

This one did the trick and because it has dual bands it makes it better for multiple users in our home who are all on the internet at once without affecting performance or speed.  The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because in the directions for set up they didn't explain that you needed an ethernet wire to connect your main desktop computer to the router the first time and I thought I had to go out and buy some special cable because they didn't say &#34;ethernet&#34; cord.  That would have saved me some aggravation setting it up the first time. After I figured that out on my own, it was smooth sailing.",,,

974,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,0,0,2-Oct-13,A1LYZSHXMPW9ZI,Be prepared to call the help desk,This dual band router is relatively sophisticated for a home use product.  It is a far cry from plug-n-play though.  I spent two hours in an online chat to set it up initially and then a subsequent one hour chat two weeks later to get the 5 gig band to function by manipulating the advanced settings.  I must say that my old Belkin router didn't come up the first time either without the help desk.  This must be symptomatic of these types of home network devices.  The Netgear Genie software is pretty easy to use - as long as you have the Netgear help desk guiding you through it.  Otherwise you'll need to be a journeyman network administrator to set this up.  I suppose most people just lease a home router and have their internet provider deal with it.  Where's the fun in that?,,,

Each time I would gain a bit, but never working 100% to my satisfaction. I have had several Motorola modems coupled to older Netgear or D-Link routers, newer D-link routers, and a combo Zoom router and modem. I have had so many issues and time wasted with all this especially when used with VoIP telephony. I have a long background in the electrical and communication technologies making me to be an early adopter with a constant replacement attitude to make whatever, better.After exploring what my Comcast would except, I choose this Router to fit my budget and current needs. One of the first things it gave me was video streaming that I never had before that worked. I used this to test a complete movie while also operating my PC. No flaws at all.

1132,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,2,2,29-Jul-13,A3RIPQ1VTKAQBL,N600 WNDR 3700-100NAS v.4,"Update: 17 Oct 2013. Router still going strong. Haven't had to touch a thing. Activated guest wireless when a friend watched the house for 3 weeks. Easy to do.  Easy to stream movies through Kindle.  Think it rates a rating increase to 4.5 stars.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Trying to make a decision on what router to buy to replace my old one was somewhat daunting. The list of features I thought I needed/wanted is too long to list here. A few of the important (to me) features were; it had to have an easy setup, good security, have dual Wireless capability, be IPv6 compliant, reliable, not a budget buster, and be 'liked' by a lot of users.  So, after doing extensive research/making comparisons/reading lots of reviews I finally selected this router.  Amazon got it to me free in 2 days (thanks to prime membership) and I had it up and connected to everything on my home network including all the wireless stuff in about 30 minutes. Its been a week (July 23) and so far everything is working smoothly. I'm not a network guy so I had some trepidations, but it proved to be an easy setup.  It seems that the Genie app was preloaded so I didn't need to deal with that. The unit only comes with a very short, but illustrated set-up pamphlet so it was pretty much a no-brainer to connect. Because of the reviews I knew the detailed manual was online at Netgear and didn't come with the unit. It was easy to find and download, and  I suggest you download it and read the setup steps before you activate the unit.  Its very helpful to see what's coming before u turn it on.  You will probably need to do a firmware update when u first activate the unit through the dashboard.  That process was seamless. The Genie dashboard is really nice to work with unlike my previous Linksys WRT54GS where u could only see a limit area. The dashboard displays the Internet, Wireless, attached devices, parental controls, readyshare, and Guest network (I like this feature because most of our guests/family have wireless devices with them. Now I can provide them access to the Internet without sharing my personal network) icons in one easily viewable location.  With a glance I can see the status of each of those items. Click on any of those features and you'll get more detailed information. Click on the advanced tab and you'll get more information than a average user may need or want.  I found the user manual a good tutorial for some of the advanced stuff.  I didn't do any tech analysis of the routers capabilities.  I will say that our wireless devices are scattered about the house and they don't seem to have any problem with signal strength or speed.  I think Netgear went out of their way to make the users manual and the unit easy to use. Time will tell if the hardware stands up as well. I only give it a 4 star rating for now, but I will revisit it after using the router for awhile.",,,

1157,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,1,1,17-Jul-13,A6URFNEMXO9D5,Very nice and solid router,Running rock solid on 2.4Ghz band with many devices running.  The configuration itself is a little slow and UI feels like it came from a previous century however it is straightforward and functional for the most part.  There are no super complicated options to be configured but then again this is not an enterprise grade router.Even at 25% power the router provides ample coverage and signal strength throughout my home.,,,

Couldn't afford an AC router so this was the next best option which as it turns out was the best option. I have it installed in a Leviton in wall media cabinet which affects the wireless range significantly. I am not sure that AC would have helped. I still have a signal but ended up turning the wifi off and just use 2 other routers as APs only in other parts of the house.Also, I have nothing against the stock Netgear firmware but DD-WRT had to be installed in very short order. Throughput is very good and no issues with the router hanging or doing anything unexpected. I run dozens of simultaneous P2P downloads but the router handles QoS extremely well and absolutely no noticeable slow down on web traffic which has higher priority.This is a very good router that I can highly recommend.",,,

1269,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,0,0,19-Jun-13,A29C9B9JEBSRLK,Bugs imply Quality Issues,"SUMMARY:  Excellent Wireless 2.4GHz range, No VPN.Easy plug and play IF you are happy with default setting.Otherwise, Obvious Wireless WPS security bugs related to Wireless Guest account and MAC ACL. Lost time in setup but they can work eventually - I hope!!.My heart winner: USB port powers and supports FAT32 or NTFS HDD drives for DLNA media playback over network. (Looks like a NAS)Possible Chinese Solder Joint degradtion.This is a first impression review of the WNDR3700v4, firmware V1.0.1.32.There appear to be four versions of the product all lumped under the same Amazon heading so you have no idea if a review applies to your unit.I love my Lynksys Small Business WRVS4400N Wireless-N Gigabit Router.  Virtual Lans for up to 4 SSIDs allow incredible flexibility with Wireless Guest and Private topologies along with MAC access control for each; VPN capable.Sadly Cisco chose to end of life the unit after Acquiring Linksys.  Will Cisco's replacement products hit the same high level - too early to tell, but apparently not. Many happy reviewers of the Netgear WNDR3700?? seem to think this was the ultimate Home (small business??) Wireless router.PROBLEM 1  Out of the box, unit proudly announced it could access Internet.  It went down hill from there.  Using the Web 'Genie' interface, the unit would not allow any changes to the Wireless setting (SSID, Channel etc).  It continually reported a 'WPS process is in progress, please apply the changes later' when in fact the WPS status lite showed it was not.  This is an intermittent problem which makes it hard to diagnose.The unit has no clear option to turn off WPS. However, an unconfirmed internet rumor is that disabling the WPS PIN id under advance settings disables WPS.PROBLEM 1 Fix (sort of): Tech support said push RED 'Restore Factory Settings' button.  How could that work. that's what doesn't work now?  That leads to Problem 2, but that did fix the problem FOR ONE wireless setting change only.  You have to hit reset for each change.  Until you turn SSID broadcast off. Then it seemed to fix the problem because that kills WPS.PROBLEM 2:  The erroneously labeled RED reset button does what designers call a soft reset and restores LIMITED settings.  It apparently does not restore Wireless settings.  Only a Genie factory restore actually restores to Factory settings.PROBLEM 3:  When you setup the MAC access Control in Genie and hit 'apply' it come back after a lengthy time and appears normal.  Job done. Unit secure right? Wrong.The security changes deceptively don't take place until you reboot the 3700.PROBLEM 3 FIX Suggestion:  Allow DHCP control of each connection.  There is no status or time limit for the connections.  My guess is that the security changes are stored somewhere but the current  DHCP connection is never updated until reboot.  Linksys allowed complete control of each DHCP connection with a default of 24hrs per connection.GUEST ACCOUNT, GOOD: Setting up the Wireless Guest Account was error free and easy.  The Linksys Guest approach uses VLan and is simple and elegant.  The Netgear approach is complex and relies on Genie to hide a lot of complex things happening under the hood. Where there is complexity there is room for error. However,  I verified that the Guest account was isolated from the Private Network.WIRELESS EVAL, GOOD:  I used the 'InSSIDer' app on a Laptop to evaluate Linksys 4400 v  Netgear 3700 Wireless range.  At my favorite long distance spot, InSSIDer gave the connection a 5 (Linksys)  it gave the Netgear 3700 a 10.  Linksys didnt support 5GHz, but 5GHz range of the Netgear 3700 may be faster but its range is about 1/10th that of the 2.4GHz. InSSIDer recommends DISABLING WPS  for security reasons.USB SHARE: My DLNA renderers (HDTV and Denon Network Media Player) simultaneously played different songs/streams from an 3700 installed with USB/SD Card. I could not find Amperage rating for the USB port but it also successfully POWERED and played gapless flac audio files over DLNA from 2.5' HDD in a SIIG enclosure.  Video (M2TS) plays well.CHINESE SOLDER JOINTS:  A review of the posts on Amazon show a trend for this Chinese manufactured unit to work well for a while and then develop a host of problems. My new unit works for now, but I recently had a similar problem with my Chinese HP Laser Printer.  The culprit: bad solder joints.  The fix, bake the printed circuit board at a certain temperature and time and reflow the solder joints. Time will tell on my unit. Manufacturers are not in China for the German like craftsmanship.",,,

I have 1500 square foot home, single story and I only get 2 bars at opposite ends of the house, but the full 5 bars within 20 ft. of the router. Easy to set-up, if you do not have a set-up disk, you can download it from Netgear's support page. I got the version 2 and in 6 months I have only needed to reboot once due to a firmware update. Other than that, it's plug and forget. All devices easily find both 2.4 and 5.0 bands. WiFi never drops, always constant.

I used the technical support o a couple of occasions for setting up since we had multiple devices to connect. Some of the support people were more knowledgeable than others and of course there was the factor of understanding their broken English. I would probably purchase this product again. One disappointment was difficulty in connecting an external hard drive via a USB cable to share on the network. I was not able to do this because the technical support person said I had to re-format the hard drive. I chose not to do this but will use another option.,,,

1357,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,0,0,23-May-13,A81WN786BJA5V,Decent Router at the Price Point,"This is the newest WNDR3700v4 router, so it has the increased CPU, RAM, ROM and better DD-WRT support compared to the previous V3 model (it also returns to the superior Atheros wireless chipset, compared with Broadcomm on the V3). It replaced an Ubee modem/router device from Time Warner, and I can easily tell a massive difference in wireless range and performance. Wireless range has increased noticeably, and I have far fewer timeouts when streaming multiple media sources. My over network transfer speeds have also quadrupled, which is just fantastic.The administrative interface isn't too bad out of the box, and it does support some nice features, like the mounting of USB devices for basic NAS functionality. Overall, the stock firmware gives all the features and functionality that would be required by normal users, and most of what power users would like to see.Con:I had to reboot this router once so far, but that's not the end of the world. It is also IMPOSSIBLE to fully disable WPS device pairing on this router with default firmware. You can ax the WPS PIN, which would technically stop connections, but the WPS protocol is still being broadcast. This will be remedied when I change over to  DD-WRT firmware at some point in the future. The only other 'con' is a USB wi-fi adapter (D-Link WNA-125, which is pretty old all things considered) I had in one of my HTPC's would not connect to this router if the router was set to automatic channel selection. Immediately after I manually chose a Wi-Fi channel, it connected and worked like nothing was wrong. Not necessarily the routers fault, but still something worth mentioning that was odd.Overall, I would recommend this router to friends and family compared to some of other similarly priced Linksys or D-Link routers on the market today. I definitely prefer this over my parents Asus RT-N56U, which I didn't think would be the case.",,,

Going this route provides solid protection using site categories to block general website types.  The parental controls also allow multiple schedules to be set and you can also add individual sites to a whitelist.  There's a bypass utility for mobile devices and desktop systems.  The OpenDNS solution is not as comprehensive as some other routers I've used, but it's not as complicated and so far, always works as advertised.",,,

It has stayed up continuously and I have had no compatibility issues. The web-based administration UI leaves quite a bit to be desired, but I was able to do everything I needed to, maybe just not as convenient as I would have liked. Be sure to upgrade the software right away, some features (e.g. connection logging) didn't work well until I installed the latest software.",,,
1523,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,0,0,9-Apr-13,A3F9CMU8KNAY1M,Nice to have a spare on hand!,"I wish this could be a super techie review on this router, but thanks to the support at ATT it's not.  It all started when I called ATT support because the 2Wire gateway we had was rebooting every 2 minutes.  After talking for awhile we decided it was the gateway.  I told him we had a Actiontec modem for just such a emergency, along with this Netgear router.  But I was unsure on how to connect to the internet. He told me he would walk me through the whole process.  After all the devices were plugged in we went to work.  The Actiontec modem found the account and then set up automatically.  Next step was to connect the Ethernet cable from modem to router. The next thing we knew one of our wireless computers was asking if we wanted to name our network with the name it had come up with and the passphrase.  Also if the encryption was what we wanted or something stronger.Amazed, we clicked OK and went forward.  We were on the net, but didn't know how.  Of the few times I have had to set up a network to be able to use the net, this is the first one that almost did it for me.  After getting off the phone with ATT support I had to go into the router interface to see what had happened.  Once inside the router I could retrieve the network name and the passphrase.  Now we were able to set up the rest of our wireless computers.I like what this router has to offer.  The only device I can use the 5G on is an iPad so far.  But I do notice that because of the multiple antennas that computers coming out of sleep connect to the net faster than the 2Wire and the distribution of bandwidth is much better.  Would I get another Netgear router again, you betcha.  That time I hope I could go through the setup a little more.  I like to know why things are happening.I have to give it 4 1/2 stars, only because once in a while I have to reboot it.  Not sure why, but that's all it takes to be on the net again.  The internet has been working the majority of the time since installing this router; we're so glad we had it on hand!  :-)",,,

1545,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,1,1,4-Apr-13,A1D25FR5USAM3V,A Good Router. But Will Become Worst Nightmare With Interference.,"I got this router, do to the fact that I needed a WIFI in the house. Considering I can't sit in one spot for too long. So I got this Netgear N600 Gigabit router to tend to my needs. It's a respectable router for the price. Considering the REALLY REALLY swell ones run up to 200 bucks a pop. The Genie is a cute little feature. Although it could do a little more. And it's a good slick looking little device. But the pet peeve I have with this router is interference. If a cellphone gets near the router, or one little power surge happens. Everything gets KNOCKED out of whack. Either the speed starts to slow down drastically to dial up speeds, or my two laptops and Playstation 3 lose connection all together. The WiFi will refuse to pick up again. Which will lead me to unplugging the router, getting it in closer contact with my two Acers and Playstation 3 to pick up the routers IP signal again. Then everything's back to normal. For the moment.Thanks to this draw back, and do to the fact that this unplugging and plugging back in thing is starting to become a weekly routine. I can only give this router an 'Okay' rating for only 3 stars. Not bad, but could be better for a 100 bucks.Just a little note. If you have any smartphone/cellphones. KEEP THEM AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS ROUTER AS POSSIBLE. Make the devices avoid each other like the plague, if you do that you'll be fine. But so far, it's a good little router. That can either be a dream on good days, or your worst nightmare on the bad ones.(EDIT)Well the router seems to be working like a charm now. All I did was reset the whole router to factory settings. Moved the router itself to another location. And now it's doing just fine. The constant unplugging and replugging problem is now gone. I only had a problem just once. But it wasn't the router itself, their was a problem with my Internet provider. The Genie seems to be doing something weird like saying 'Internet Connected' one minute. Then saying 'Internet Disconnected' the next. But those messages is not that serious, considering that I stay connected and logged on.And their for I am rising my score one star. Still think it's silly that a router of this price could easily be interfered with. But if you just be smart, and keep harmful objects away from it. You'll do fine.",,,

It was very frustrating.I finally got an external USB hardrive to work as intended.I am going to pass on a MAJORLY HELPFUL tip.Put an EXT3 filesystem on the drive and then connect it to the netgear.It turns out that many users have had problems connecting a USB external drive to the usb port on the router.In my case it would not detect the USB drive, giving some generic error message, ' please attach a USB drive'.  It did however, detect a 32GB usb flash drive, and my windows 7 laptop could read/write there as a share.I did a search and found a tip on a linux forum that said laying down an ext3 filesystem on the external drive would solve the issue.It DID!.  This could have been very frustrating.The best way to do this is install a virtual machine on your host OS and load some linux distribution -Fedora,Ubuntu,Redhat,etc,- on it.  Attach the usb drive to the linux machine and run the mkfsext3 or other appropriate commands.No, it's not necessarily for beginners, but some forums can help you through it or perhaps you have a Unix/Linux savy friend.Must be ext3 not ext2.I can now do a wireless backup of my laptop!The general network speed is very nice.  Now have 42mbps download wireless at laptop, where the old router was a bottle neck at around 15mbps.Pleased overall, so far.",,,

However, in general it seems to be a high quality product.  I have some technical skills and what I most appreciated about this router was the absence of a CD to install anything but a flyer where I could find all I needed to go to the web interface and change the default settings for the two networks this dual band router brings.

I love DD-WRT, but this one is not yet supported by that 3rd party firmware. I'm really looking forward to when they release a port for this H/W (see the Con comment below).Pros:- Very fast, both the wireless and the wired- If you have your computer and your modem connected to the router when you power it up, the 'genie' does a pretty good job at a first shot attempt at connecting to the internet. But, really, you're going to want to 'get under the hood' and lock this down just a bit.Cons:- I received the first one and the WAN port died in a couple of weeks, well within the 30 day RMA window. I have to say that the Amazon RMA process was painless - they even paid shipping for the failed unit back to them and for the replacement back to me.- The firmware needs a lot of help. Configuring the router is a Very, Very, VERY slow process. It seems as if when you update a configuration page of values that the router does a complete re-boot. And, in fact, on a couple of pages, the LEDs seem to indicate exactly that. Some pages are a bit faster .... but not by much. Setting it took the better part of 45 minutes and this isn't the first router setup I've ever done.- The unit comes with a CAT5 patch cord to connect between your modem and the router. I could not get the router to see the modem with this cord (yes, I did the power them all down, start and wait for the modem, then start the router .... twice). Bounce the modem and router after replacing the supplied patch cord with one of my own - success. The supplied cord is now in file 13.It's much to early to determine if I would recommend this to others. I'm hoping it is as dependable as my WNR3500 - which I've had for years!",,,

I am not going with NetGear for this next purchase - just Primed Asus RT-AC66U 802.11ac for a Gigabit experience - will let you know.I suppose if I think about it, the Airport Extreme prior to this NetGear was humming along as well until the lightning strike, so maybe two years for a high use, high performance router is all one can expect for a home focused router...nkr",,,

My previous device had an flimsy button to turn off the wi-fi.

Unfortunately, after I set up the network I discovered that the Playstation 3 doesn't have a 5 GHZ radio so that the dual band was essentially moot. I guess that's on me for not doing my due diligence.

I like that is it Dual Band, so i setup some devices on 2.4 gHz channel while a couple on the 5 gHz.  The video streaming is smooth now.  Also our VoIP phones are working much better.

Additionally, it has the NETGEAR genie App for your iOS or Android devices so you can have a 'personal dashboard' to monitor, control & repair your home network.

2010,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,1,1,19-Dec-12,A20P93JNMG5OKU,"Not Perfect, but worth the money","My previous router was a D-Link Dir-625. It had adequate speed, and range for my needs, and I also liked the D-Link interface. The problem I was having was that it required a reboot at least once or twice a day. This may have been because I have over a dozen devices that connect to my network. Another problem was that because my wireless webcam only had the B & G wireless protocol, I was prevented from using my router in N mode. After a little research, I zeroed in on the Netgear n600 Dual Band Gigabit. I was very tempted to go with a D-link dual band router (dual band lets you operate both N compatible and non-N compatible devices). The deciding factor in switching to Netgear was that I had been using the very useful Netgear Genie router utility. This free, downloadable utility will function with any router, but some of the features are only compatible with Netgear routers.Setup was pretty simple. I hate reading manuals and found the Netgear interface pretty intuitive. I would recommend you use your browser and URL [...] to access the router's interface. If you are a beginner, you should use the Genie utility and follow instructions. After connecting all the cables, remember to reboot your modem before booting up the router the first time. You should also turn off other devices that are connected to your network.  The dual band set up is a little confusing and I am still not sure I am using it correctly. I might just have to read the manual.The reason I am only giving 4 starts is that I cannot say that I have noticed any super increase in range or speed, although I can now use the N mode on my laptop thanks to the Dual Band feature. I was a little worried that with no external antennas, range would have been compromised, but so far no problems.The biggest benefit is that after two days, I have not had any dropouts requiring a reboot. I will keep you posted if this changes. I also like the interface which is easy to navigate with a multitude of features, and easy to configure. It's as good, if not better than the D-Link. It  also includes a built-in help feature.Oh yes, the router has an actual on/off switch so you don't have to struggle with the power cord every time you need to do a reboot. That alone could be considered the fifth star.",0,0,"0_.png"" alt=""Click to watch this video"" id=""cv_mo1ZSYDXA4HKGCOpreplayImageId"" /></a>"

I would highly recommend this one if you are looking for dual band router. The 2.4 and 5Ghz works perfectly fine and I have some of my devices connecting to 2.4 and some to 5 GHz band.

It sounds like you can share your printer via USB, but that is not the case.  When I brought that up to their support they were not very helpful nor informative.  The Netgear genie software is useless.  It kept telling me that my internet connection was disconnected.  It was not really necessary to have this software to use the router.

My previous router was a linksys wrt54g that is 5 years old but is still working good. The web based 192.168.1.1 setup menu is a bit messed up and confusing(not like linksys) Factory settings include by default a lot of useless options 'on' and it takes a lot of time to disable them and keep only the one you need. It takes 20-40 seconds for the router to apply each setting that you change!When connecting to 'A' wireless band 5.0ghz, 300mb option, the latency is amazing, the wireless coverage is great. No cons here. It gets to my full 18mb/s download speed just in a few seconds. Web pages open faster than usual. My Previous linksys router latency is good, but it's 2-3 times slower, and it gets only 17mb/s out of 18mb/s full speed.But the b/g/n 2.4ghz wireless band of a netgear router is crappy. I tried every option, disabled all other bands including guests with no changes.Top speed is not more than 8mb/s out of 18bm/s. the coverage is 2-3 times less than my previous linksys wrt54g which is unacceptable.I wanted to have 5.0ghz band that only my laptop supports but didn't want for other devices in my home to have crappy netgear's 2.4ghz wireless. What i did was installing first my previous linksys wrt54g to cable modem, setup its QOS with lan port1 priority to 'high', and netgear's mac address 'priority' device. Then i connected netgear to lan port1 of the linksys router. On netgear i disabled any possible option except the main 5.0ghz band.

I know there is one newer on the Netgear website, but it's technically a beta and so... i wait.  My current firmware works and so i leave it alone.The range is pretty good.  I wish it were a touch stronger though and i've been researching range extenders or upgrading to a new netgear router thinking i'd get a stronger signal, but... not sure.  There's a ton of negative reviews about Netgear support and that they've tanked.But the range, ultimately, is pretty good.The router is in a corner in the basement.  I get very strong signals on the main floor and then decent signals upstairs.Upstairs, my wife uses 1st generation Ipad and has no problems.  I also have used ROKU as well as a bluray player on wireless and have not had problems.  The ROKU streams HD even when on wireless and again, that's upstairs.I also have a printer that is wireless and it works fine too.I have Vonage (ugh), wired printers, wired DTV receivers and wired computers in my home.  They all work flawlessly.I run a gigabit network throughout my home.So between the phones, printers, laptops, roku, bluray, pc's and server... i'm happy.  I do not get disconnects or drop outs, i get a solid connection at almost all times.  IN fact, it is not uncommon for me to go more than 45 days before getting a new IP address from my ISP.  I have a utility that emails me anytime the ip address changes.  I know when the router drops out because the IP address changes... and this happens maybe 2 or 3 times in a year... which makes me think the issue is ISP related and not the router.Ironically though... even though my wife can connect her ipad from upstairs, estimated 30 feet from where the router is, in a straight line... she can't connect only 12 feet from outside, on the same side of the house where the router is located.  Go figure.I have an old Dlink Access Point which i hook up then when she's outside and that does the trick, but it messes with my network so i don't run it all the time.And because of the age of that A.P. i've been researching the newer Netgear models.I've been a life long Netgear fan!  I have a 24 port switch, multiple 8 port switches and i've had several Netgear routers over the years.I've also used Linksys (not a huge fan, but that's just me) and i've used Dlink (i am a fan of their older Gaming Routers, but their newer GREEN switches are junk.  EIther they burn out or their power adpaters do and there is no such thing as technical support with dlink once you're outside the warranty period.  Kinda like HP... their support stinks too, even when under warranty.).Anyhow, the Dlink Gaming was my favorite router for years until i wanted something newer and found this one.  I really am pretty happy with this router.So now the question for me is whether to get a range extender or upgrade to a newer Netgear router, in order to get that extra bit if signal outside.My concern though with upgrading to a newer Netgear are the reviews for the newer Netgear products.People who read these reviews, sometimes get upset when customers base their review on technical support experiences vs. pure product experiences, but i am of the opinion that technical support experiences is a part and should be a part of the review.I am fortunate, i have not had the need for tech support in years.  But, when reading the reviews for the newer routers, peole are sharing their horror stories with Netgear... and so i think it's worthy of mentioning here, what people are reporting.Netgear's support people are not fluent in English.  So if English is your native language, good luck communicating with Netgear support.Netgear considers firmware as software and therefore, if after 90 days of ownership they release a firmware update and it has a problem and messes up your router, they will not support it unless you BUY technical support.Netgear is now more like HP and is more concerned about getting every extra $$ out of people vs. actually caring for their customers.  THis is why i will not bring HP into this house any more.  I wrote them off 3 yrs ago.  So to hear that Netgear charges more than $150 for support when they messed up someones router... is wrong.  Especially when that's nearly the cost for a new router.Lastly, i see where Netgear has read almost all reviews for their stuff and they reply.  The replies seem genuine enough until you've read a few dozen of them.  Then you start to see that they are all the same.  Paraphrasing, 'sorry for your experience with tech support, we want to investigate to make sure it doens't happen again, send us your case number and we will help you get this fixed.'  and then you look and the customers report back here, in their feedbacks, that they then never hear from Netgear again.That tells me that Netgear is trying to do public facing damage control via Amazon reviews and it's all about marketing and NOT about their customers.So, i need to put this out there for anyone considering this router or any other Netgear product.Their support is not what it used to be, based on dozens and dozens and dozens of reviews here on Amazon.So i'm torn.  I REALLY WANT TO UPGRADE... because i like NEW and FAST... but i'm torn as i don't know what to do.  I'm really afraid i'm going to have a problem on their HIGH END routers and i just can't count on Netgear support.  They are not customer focused anymore.That all said... this particular router... i recommend it all the way.  Just flash the firmware immediately by following the instrudtions... and then set it up and you're done.I love this router.  I just wish the signal was a touch stronger.I hope this is helpful for people and if not, sorry for being long winded.T",,,

The only problem is that some laptops when they are turned off and you turn them back on, the wifi have to be selected and not automatically like it used to be with my other router. The speed it is really nice and fast, but no every corner in my apartment is covered by it. Some dead spots here and there but no big deal. Overall a pretty nice router.",,,
2316,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,0,0,23-Aug-12,A20951I210L0IB,A good router for a lot less than what I paid several years ago.,"But, that's the way PC pricing goes. 2 years ago it was around $160, now - $89.95. This router worked very well for us (in two different floorplan scenarios), with the 5Ghz band being used strictly for Streaming to our Roku boxes, leaving the 2.4 segment for the usual wifi stuff.Once configured, I didn't have to go back in to change a thing (even after the big move, it was plug'n play). I've had linksys (pre-Cisco and post-Cisco), D-links, and other brand wireless routers give up the ghost and drift into bit-limbo, but this was a solid device. I've never had a reason to consult or talk to their tech support so I can't comment on that experience.For the keen-eyed reader, you've noticed I wrote '...this WAS a solid device'. Technically it still is, but I replaced it with the N600 3800 for that routers dedicated video mode. As with the 3700 - no complaints.",,,

I found the beta builds to be fairly unstable compared to my old WRT-54GL and with a few soft bricks I decided to revert back to stock. Since then I have not ever thought about going back to DD-WRT, I don't use any of the advanced features because my NAS does everything for me so good ol' stock firmware has been rock solid with no drops running straight 24/7 for 8 months and counting. Couldn't be happier but 4 stars for less than stellar DD-WRT distro even though Netgear paid for it.",,,

I do have to reboot it every day because the router stops responding on a regular basis, the 2.x responds 100% of the time, the 5.x does not work all of the time until you reboot it.  So I put the router on a timer to reboot once in the morning and once in the evening.  That appears to be working for now.While its a good replacement, its NOT reliable with its default settings.UPDATE from yesterday:  I dove deeply into the settings of this router and discovered the QoS featuer, I enabled it and DELETED any IP Phone crap and the router has been ROCK SOLID!  Would I buy another one again, yes, if they keep this setting available to the end user!  :)  Now I'm _VERY HAPPY_ with this router.  Albeit, the novice computer user might not find this setting.",,,
2519,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,0,0,16-May-12,AY8S0ZSMVGYBG,Excellent Performing with Minor Complaint,"I purchased a refurb version so paid half of what it cost brand new. It has performed well. Speed tests have been spot on with what my speeds are suppose to be. Its dual band (2.4ghz and 5ghz), but in fact each band has an optional guest network as well so you can actually have 4 different networks set-up which is a bit too much but at least you have that option. Have only had it for several days and so far so good. Not a huge deal for people that use this at home but it can also keep track of usage and you can have the router auto disconnect once it reaches a certain data cap that you set. Again most ISP's don't have capped data so not sure most would need this. This replaced a D-Link DIR-815.The one minor complaint......the USB readyshare is a bit slow at read/write speeds, as some others complained about. A big seller for me was the USB, which the D-Link lacked, because it would allow me to share an external drive across the networks but speed was an annoyance. Its still an excellent router nonetheless.For those that are experiencing connection issues, I have found with experience that you may need to update the firmware. The first thing I did when I set this up was search for a firmware update, which was available.",,,

The only complaint, as others have noted, is the read/write speed of the usb to my 1TB hard drive.  It's abysmally slow - which seems crazy considering that it can transfer to a remote computer, wirelessly, and write tot THAT hard drive much faster.But if you aren't hooking up a hard drive, this router should be perfect for you.",,,

2580,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,0,0,21-Apr-12,A23JORXBF9ZOFN,Nice but took a little doing to set up,"Not as easy to set up as some routers I've had. The setup Genie kept telling me I had a static IP address. NetGear Customer Service agent 'Paul', after some testing, rebooting, and cable swaping told me I had to call my IP provider, Verizon, for internet connection issues. Before calling Verizon I reasearched the issue online and found if you are using Verizon then Verizon must release the MAC code and let it reassign to the new router. Try explaining that to 'Joseph', who sounded remarkably like 'Paul', in the Verizon overseas Call Center. After an hour of 'Joseph' having me reboot, recable, and re-everything, 'Joseph' told me my computer was broken and I needed to call the computer manufacturer for repairs. I loudly convinced him my computer wasn't broken and got him to release the MAC code. The new router quickly accepted the code and after that the set up was simple. My home is a large 3 story with my office in the lowest level. I run 2 computers in my office, a Smart TV on the second floor, and two computers on the 3rd floor, two Smart Phones all around the house, and can sit on my deck or patio and use my laptop and Smart Phone without a hitch so the WNDR3700 seems to have enough range to do what I need it to do. I am giving it 4 stars because I am pleased with it's performance, albeit brand new. I took away one star because I don't think NetGear Customer Service did enough to research the issue.  I would recommend this item, just remember if you are using a VERIZON router you will have to deal with 'Joseph', 'Paul', or 'Peggy'.",,,

UPDATE,"After 4 years, my old Linksys 54GS Router stopped working reliably so I thought I'd reevaluate my current home network workload.  I currently run a Toshiba laptop with an i7 processor, an iPad 2, a Canon Wi-Fi Capable Printer, and a Playstation 3 through my network.  Rarely, I bring home my work laptop which is an Apple Macbook Pro.  Since I watch a lot of streaming video, play online video games, and online chat with my friends, I figured I'd buy an upper tier wireless router to put the package all together.What I've found was a headache.  But let's get to the positives first.1.  Good customer support.  Ok, I'm no pro but when I first started having this issue, I spent a lot of time back and forth with their customer service and they seemed to be quite knowledgeable and friendly.  They even emailed me detailed instructions of what they said to do so I can refer to it easily (the person I talked to offered to do it but you might have to ask for it).  My issue went all the way to RMA and the process was seamless.2.  Setup was easy.3.  Range and speed was good when it was working.Cons:1.  It randomly has DNS Server Not Responding errors.  Most of these errors would just crash the internet in my apartment.  I'm not sure if some of it was related to my crowded environment but anyways...  Most of these went away when I stopped using Firefox.  However, I've not found anyone else who has had this issue.  To make matters more odd.... the best way to replicate this error is to visit ESPN.com.  I cannot tell you why, but my best guess is the embedded Flash videos in their website crashes my router.  And by the way, it doesn't matter whether or not I'm wired in or wireless.2.  The 'new' router has the same issue as the old one.Would I recommend this router?  YESUPDATE:  I responded to the manufacturer's link below and what happened was interesting.  What little I got before turned into a whirlwind response.  I ended up RMA-ing the original router and getting a new one.  The problem did not get resolved.  It was a never ending process that NETGEAR handled very well, even if it took quite a while.

Set up was simple taking only 10 minutes to update firmware, setup password, SSID etc... and am now getting 5 bars throughout the house. No drop signals and blazing speed. I really like the guest network feature which allow guests to use a separate network thus avoiding access to shared hard drives in your private network. I hope this refurbished router that I got will last me a while.All in all, I am now satisfied with Netgear's response to my problem.

Wasted over an hour with netgear support only to be cut off and never receive a return call.Finally, after googling the problem I was able to set it up as a wired extension to me network. To set this up you have to connect a wan port from the first to one of the wan ports on the second n600. Give the 2nd one a different ip address (not 192.168.1.1) I used 192.168.1.2. Do not set up the wan settings on the second. Turn off DHCP on the 2nd so all wired and wireless devices get an address from the first router, then duplicate your wireless settings exactly as they are on your first one.Once I had it up and running it is working great.I would have rated this 5 stars if netgear had allowed me to set a gateway address so the 2nd one would see that there is an internet connection and check for updates, but with no wan settings the 2nd one doesn't think it has internet connectivity.",,,

However, they did all they could and eventually got me a new boxed item. Now that I have the router, I'm glad I didn't try to get another one. This router replace an older TrendNet router that kept loosing it's signal and kicking everyone using it off the internet. This Netgear model is easy to set up and the online site to change the settings is easy to use. I'm enjoying that I can now have two different bands of internet to use so that my PC isn't being bogged down by all the other things in my apartment using the internet.

With that in mind and having no patience for unreliable connections I started looking for the fastest, most reliable open source compatible dual band router I could find, cost wasnt really an issue.Reading various forums a lot of people were saying the 3700 was the one to get to run open source so I decided to give it a shot.With the latest stock firmware and everything setup properly I was getting lots of packet loss and my transfer speeds on the LAN and Wan sides were about half of what I got from my older routers.  I then installed the latest Gargoyle build of OpenWrt (loads just like the stock firmware since the stock firmware is actually a version of OpenWrt netgear has somehow managed to ruin).  Now my speeds are at least doubled, in some cases quadrupled(video file transfer), there's no p/l, the router so far is rock solid and and the connection from anywhere in the house is great.  Doing 20mbit/s transfers from the internet over wired connection while transferring video files wirelessly (72mbit/s sustained) the router runs completely stable.Bottom line, stock this router is a turkey, I'd give it one star and would have returned it the next day, but since it works so well with gargoyle it gets a 4 from me.Couple of quick notes:1.  The 3700s now out there for sale are all v2 like mine, from what I've read there was a slight drop in wireless performance compared to v1 at I think 2.4ghz, but I am still happy with the speed2.  It's completely identical to the WNDR37av, only the box is different, the router therein is still marked as a WNDR3700v2.If anything changes I'll update this review.",,,

I even looked at websites that rank wireless routers and this was almost always in top ten for different sites.  The price at the time was considerably more expensive than other routers which gave me pause but the real reason for that is the dual band feature (I'm sure Netgear would say other reasons but that is the reason from a consumers perspective).  I didn't realize when I bought it how much that feature would come into play later on, in fact I figured I was making the same mistake that I made when I bought a high end VCR back in the day (all the bells and  whistles that run up price and ultimately just use it to watch movies).  Not true for this device the dual band really comes in handy if you get a lot of people coming over and you don't want to give out your password to you're primary network.  Just enable the second band (use the fastest one for your network and the slower for everybody else). I see a huge variance in reviews another reason for my hesitancy in purchasing this product.  What I think is really happening there is a lot of people (me included when I purchased the product) just know this allows you not to be tethered via a cord.  I suspect they don't really understand the setup procedures an sort of muddle through it (I was guilty of this) well there are several Youtube videos that walk you through step by step and go through the functions how to set up/how they work and the pros/cons.  For me this made a huge difference for one I'm a typical guy I only read directions as a last resort but will watch a video in a second and two making the leap from reading/following/understanding directions doesn't always happen(guess I should have been the remedial class in school)  So if your having trouble use the YouTube video's.I never had problem remaining connected only on two occassion did I lose connection the first year (both times I suspected I lost my cable connection and the router did not pick it back up automatically).  The third occassion I hit the key on laptop that disables wireless don't laugh spent two hours trying to figure out and thought the router was the problem.  Signal strength for me is off the charts on 5GHZ  I do recommend placing in a strategic location (general rule the higher the better) looks as far as other routers not bad does show fingerprints one cleaning after setup and you shouldn't have to touch it again that being said I've never looked at any router and said thats attractive I think I'll put that on the table as a centerpiece just do the best you can being discreet and elevated unless you have a monster size house or lead walls you should be covered.  I bought mine refurbished as price was too high for a new one at the time.  I've always had success doing this and since its doesn't have moving parts I figured on the retest at the factory working order would be verified (I assume they go through all functions when they get something sent back of course some flunky making minimum wage is probably doing the testing and the likelyhood of him taking a shortcut seems high.  Either way it came looked brand new one thing to note when you do this some directions/cd did not come with it that was fine you have to update from the internet anyway.  They do take the off the serial number and you can't register it with Netgear (your warranty in this case actually should come from the seller and it won't be that long) but most things tend to break right out of the box or soonafter if not then you typically get normal life with that product.Pro'sDual bandGreat signal strengthCan be setup discreetlyConsPriceSetup is a little complex",,,

2911,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,2,3,23-Dec-11,A3FQFEYKYMALBG,"Good stable router, but screwy cableing instructions","If you followed the instructions on the included CD to the letter, you would plug your computer into the WAN port of the Router, and the modem cable into a LAN port. If one didn't know better, one could spend hours trying to figure out why it wouldn't work. Luckily, I knew better, so I had no problems. A simple picture would be a lot clearer. And I sure miss printed manuals.The router seems fully featured, is easily set up with intuitive software, it has good range, is fast, and seems very stable. Ive got 3 other wireless routers cascaded from it to give wireless coverage over 5 acres and Ethernet in a couple of outbuildings. My previous primary routers would need rebooting every couple weeks or so. Ive only had this one up a few days, but it seems stable and if it ever needs a power cycle, the off switch in the back will be handy.Update:after a couple months, I really like this router. In fact, I never have to think about it. It is stable as a rock and the signal is excellent. Ive got an app on my phone that measures signal strength and it nearly makes the 3 other routers cascaded off of it redundant.",,,

But if I can try out something else for free, well why not? So, it's as fast and reliable as my Airport stuff, at least for the short time I used it. Easy to set up with Macs. I cannot speak to its interface with IBM-type PCs. So, if you need a 802.11n router, the current price of 99-bucks seems like a great deal. It is an outdated model (N900 is the latest, I believe) and some of the printed specs seem to indicate you'd be better off with the newer model for 80-bucks more.",,,

Set-up was very easy, albeit a bit slow. I thought that the onscreen instructions guiding me through the wireless encryption process were especially user-friendly ... a real breeze, contrary to my experience with my previous, now 4-year-old, CISCO/Linksys WRT54G router, which this one replaced. The most impressive feature of this model, however, was its lightning-fast wireless signal throughput speed that almost matched the wired throughput rate. Again, this was a very pleasant surprise because the wireless:wired ratio for my old router had been about 1:4. This router is bulkier than most I have seen, but not heavy; stood upright on its stand, its footprint is very small. All, in all, my experience thus far has been very positive and I highly recommend this model, especially for users with multiple WiFi devices.",,,

But if you are buying this router to use with an external USB hard drive be warned that it is painfully slow. You can move data from the NSA drive connected to the routers USB port at around 11 megabits per second. That is about 1/3 the speed that you would get if you connected the hard drive to a USB port on your computer, and that's the good news. transferring data from another computer to the hard drive connected to the router averages around 2 megabits per second. That works out to around ten minutes per gigabyte.If you are mostly copying small files to the NSA hard drive, that is a barely tolerable amount of time, but I can live with it. If you are thinking of using the NAS drive to receive large files, for instance Acronis True Image backup files, forget about it. A single file can take over eight hours copy to the NAS drive. It's the closest thing to going back to dial-up modem speeds that you can experience with modern computer technology.If you just want a great WI-FI gigabit router without the NAS hype, then this is a good piece of gear. It sets up easily and it perform admirably. Netgear should disclose the very slow speeds for NAS usage.",,,

Customer sercive is horrible took 5 days and having me return a perfectly good router because they said there was a hardware issue. Still they did not solve anything, just had me jump through hoops. They even elevated it to the 'next level' of tech support and said they would call me back in 15 min..... no call, called back the next day and they had closed my case saying it was resolved......Turns out the only problem I had with it was not seting my DSL Modem to Bridge mode (which is a 5 min fix).

2981,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,2,2,18-Oct-11,A2FX4LO7BIDSQ0,"Netgear router ok, Netgear Tech Support Horror Story described here:","I forgot the password for my Netgear wireless router, and due to making a change in the Intel wireless adapter window, I lost the connection between the computer and the router, and therefore access to the internet.The written installation instructions of my wireless router do not mention how to reset the password / modem. I did know the default username and password.I called tech support about resetting the router and password. The internet would have given me the answer in a few seconds, i.e. 'press a needle in the tiny hole in the back of the router', but I had no access to another computer at this time, because I live in the country.What happened then is a Tech Support Fraud Story. I was told that the only option I had for 'resetting a password' was to subscribe to either a one-year tech support contract for $ 99, or a life long subscription.I said that for the $99, I could buy a  new modem. The Indian agent at the other end said, literally, that 'this would not help with this issue' (although a new modem comes with a 90 day support, i.e. he lied).I asked him if there is no cheaper way to solve this. He said 'no'. As I said, I live in the country and did not have access to the internet at this moment, and wanted the problem solved.After some back and forth with two more agents, I signed up for the one year support.The tech agent told me to open and close countless windows, and after an hour of this, I was finally told me the solution, i.e. resetting the modem with the needle.When the internet was re-connected, I went straight to the Netgear Tech Support site. There, under the button 'Service Offerings' it states clearly that Netgear offers a 'pay-per-incident' tech support option for $39. I had spoken to four different agents, and none of them told me about this possibility, even when I asked for cheaper alternatives to the '$99 yearly contract'.This means I was lied  to by the Netgear Tech Support agents. They obtained my agreement to this contract based on lying. In my view, they obtained this contract through fraudulent means.I called them back to complain and to ask for a refund. I asked to pay the $39 'pay-per-incident' option instead, and to void the one-year contract that was obtained after not telling me the truth about my tech support options.  The agent answered in a very condescending manner: 'in two months, you will have the same problem again', 'you will be glad to have this contract later on'. He also said that 'everyone who signed up today has signed up for the yearly contract'. This is  no wonder, if the other customers were manipulated in the same way as I was. My request to be put through to the manager / supervisor was ignored, as the agent kept  talking back to me.I have dealt with other computer tech support in India / Asia at previous times, and at no time have I experienced this kind of unethical behavior. I call it fraudulent.So far, messages that I posted on the tech support 'contact' form, as well as an e-mail message to the company here in the US have not been answered.I wonder how many other victims of these 'business practices' are there. I would advise Netgear to clean house in your tech support department.",,,

2991,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,0,0,9-Oct-11,A3R2LJSRBMN2DM,"Solid Router, 5G band weaker than 2.4G","It's been running smoothly for a month straight without any issues. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is because of the much weaker 5G band. I can run the 2.4G band at 50% power and it is still stronger than the 5G band at 100% power reported by the same laptop. I have a 2008 Dell laptop and a 2011 Mac Book Air (option-click the wifi wave symbol), both show the same effect. Another interesting thing I noticed about the 5G band is that the default channel 44 will show a lower received signal strength than channel 153 but channel 44 would give me much higher data rate than channel 153, typically 270Mbps vs 54~160Mbps.Anther issue I found was that when I bring my laptop out of standby/sleep, sometimes I get a warning or error when it tries to re-connect to the network, I later realized that the router would reassign a new ip address to the device if there was another device that joined the network during the sleep. This problem was easily solved by assigning each device a static ip address through the 'LAN' tab in the router setup page. Hope this tip can help you with reconnect issues.",,,

3126,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,0,0,9-Sep-11,A1GR7G99RD6AI1,Good performance; troublesome tech support,"This router performs well, and was a good upgrade from my previous unit (a Netgear WGR614 b/g wireless router).  The wireless radios on my purchased unit died suddenly after about a month, and Netgear replaced the unit under warranty.  The replacement unit has been trouble-free.  I use the dual-band capability to do some basic traffic management, connecting my Roku XDS streaming media device on the 5 GHz band and keeping laptops, iPods, and other devices on the 2.4GHz band.  The signal is very strong; with a direct line-of-sight to my house, I can keep a wireless connection from nearly 100 yards away.One thing to be aware of is that the LEDs on the unit are very bright.  The router is in my bedroom, and the lights were bright enough to be bothersome at night until I faced the unit toward the wall, which muted the effect.Netgear's tech support was frustrating to deal with.  I'm an IT guy, and when the wireless went bad, I could tell what the problem was.  The wired ports worked fine, so the routing hardware was OK, but a laptop sitting five feet away would get almost no signal.  Netgear tech support went back and forth with me for several weeks, having me upgrade the firmware, and change various settings on the router (such as MTU size)--all of which were a waste of time because the radios were bad.  It got to the point where it seemed like they were just trying anything they could think of to avoid replacing the unit.  Finally I told them flat-out that I wanted it replaced, and they did so.Overall, I am happy with the router, and would buy it again.",,,

Netgear tech support was unhelpful--all they could offer was to reconfigure the router.

This router was a replacement for my previous NetGear WNR2000...and let me just say it's soooo much better.  I'm getting 4x the download speeds and 2x the upload speeds compared to my old router.  Also to note, the range is also really good.  My apartment isn't too large 1000 sq. feet, but like anybody else that knows about old New York City apartment buildings..the cinder block walls are a little tough for a wifi signal to traverse.I know some people aren't big on refurb items, but I have had really good experiences with Amazon refurbished resellers.",,,
3390,XX,B002HWRJY4,4,2,4,26-May-11,A2QPNLFW8FC6DN,"First impressions are very good, be cautious with negative reviews","First off, ignore the old reviews!  Hardware and firmware are upgraded often enough that nothing more than a few months old is likely to be very valuable.Second, ratings for ease of installation are always subject to user knowledge (I've done tech support for more than 20 years) so 'geek speach' for one is 'baby talk' for others... in most cases, it's just a matter of actually READING exactly what you are being told to do instead of the skimming that many users do!Setup - I first installed this using my desktop computer on a wired connection and was up and running in less than 15 mins.  I had another desktop and two three laptops to setup and the only thing I ran into was that in the initial setup of the router I had to enter the full hex key for my wireless network and when I went to connect the wireless devices I had to go back into the router config manually and change the passphrase back to my original 4 letter phrase and tell it to generate the key.  Once that was done everything else connected with no issue.The USB port is nice, but usable for connecting storage only, I would've rather been able to connect a USB printer, but hey... my previous router didn't even have the USB option.Speed - noticably faster, even on my wife's laptop which can only connect to the 2.4Ghz band with a G connection, and on the desktop I keep in the garage with a very old Linksys USB adapter passing through two interior and one exterior wall.Dropped connections - I haven't had any, but be aware that many dropped connections have NOTHING to do with your router.  It could be your ISP, but even more likely is router location and other electronic devices in your home (i.e. Microwaves, garage door openers, cordless phones etc...)When you see a product with so many 5-star reviews, you really have to take the far smaller number of very negative reviews with a grain of salt and look for other reasons why they may have had issues.  In my experience, failure to read and follow directions, lack of patience and failure to pay attention to system requirements lead to most technical issues!Oh, and someone complained about issues using this with Apple devices - if you do your research, you will quickly find that almost all reviewers recommend that you use ONLY Apple routers with Apple devices... they are noted for being VERY proprietary!  People bash Microsoft for 'monopolizing' their market but Apple is far more hardware dependent.  I can build all my own Windows PCs and upgrade them at will, but my Apple friends are tied to their more expensive Apple hardware.Yes, it's more expensive than some other routers, but you get what you pay for and this router delivers.  Again, so far as I can tell, every advertised option works as described so those old firmware 'bugs' cited in the older reviews likely no longer apply and Amazon really needs to consider removing old reviews on computer related devices since anything over a year old is practically a dinosaur!",,,

46,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,25-May-11,A3H3HZGVI37AQJ,Excellent Router,"I have to say, I was a bet skeptical when buying this router. I heard a lot of mixed reviews about it. However, I have to say the investment was worth it. I'm going to break my review down into chronological order to show the 'steps of usage.'--Setup--The setup was very easy. I may be a technical person, but this is something so easy that I would trust even my technologically illiterate grandfather to be able to set up. All the cords are color coded, so that's easy. When you've plugged it in, you pop a cd into your computer and it finishes the setup for you! It doesn't install anything on the computer, so those who are worried about bloatware can be at rest.--Connecting Devices--This router is WPS compliant. That means that if you have a WPS compliant device (which is becoming common), you don't need to type in any password. You just push a button on the front of the router and you're all set. Windows 7 takes advantage of this and will tell you to push the button on the router to connect. My Nintendo 3DS also noticed this and asked me to push the button. It's that simple: push a button and you're done. If your device doesn't support WPS, then you can also do the old fashioned thing and type in the password.The router also supports UPnP, so it takes care of the technical things like port forwarding behind the scenes. This comes in handy with things like gaming systems. These typically want certain firewall configurations to allow the best possible gaming performance. Let's say you connected an Xbox to it. The router will basically ask the Xbox if it wants the firewall to be set up a certain way and then it goes ahead and does it. No user intervention required!--Router Configuration--If you do ever need to go in and tweak any of the settings, it's pretty easy. Just go to [...] in your web browser and you'll get into the settings. No need to dig that cd back up again. Everything is laid out in a logical manner. There are three columns. The far left column contains the various categories of options. The middle column contains the options for the selected category. The far right column is a help column that explains the various options and what they do.--Real Life Usage--I've had this router for 8 months now and so far I haven't encountered any major issues. The range on the 2.4 Ghz band is impressive. The 5 Ghz band is much smaller however. The good thing is that you can set your computer up to connect to both. Then it'll connect to whichever one is in range. Netgear does also push out occasional updates that improves the performance and adds new features. One recent update that impressed me was the addition of IPv6 support. This is an emerging IP address format. The fact that they added support for that shows that Netgear is actually trying to future-proof their products rather than make you buy up later.Bottom Line: I strongly recommend this.",,,

I had it up and running with both the wired side and wireless bands in 20 min.  I use it for two dell XPS, a lap top, smart phones, and a denon receiver.  So far no problems.",,,
59,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,16-May-11,A3KVWKJ8S3DA3V,Great performance and feature set,"I bought this wireless router to replace my existing Linksys WRT54G router.  I wanted a new router which supported N as well as a dual band radio to allow me to stream video on the other network while maintain the 2.4GHz network for general use (i.e. laptops, phones, etc.).  I decided to spend a little more than you would normally on the typical home wireless router because I was tired of the reliability I was getting out of my linksys.  I had to reboot the old 54G every couple days and recently I discovered that the speed performance on my iphone 3GS was not good with that router.  Long story short, I read up and decided that this router was a good compromise between features, reliability (based on reviews), performance and cost.  I could have gone with the highest end model but decided that this model was plenty.  I do think that the cost is worth the extra features you get and hope that its also an investment into the reliability of the unit.So far I am extremely pleased, it was very SIMPLE to setup.  I am a power user of this type of equipment, but I still think it would be very easy for a new user to get going in minutes.  The web interface is easy to access and use and there are plenty of options to allow for full customization.  In fact, there are more than the average user would ever need.  While I would recommend this unit for anyone, I don't recommend that anyone go in and start messing with all the settings unless you have a good understanding of what you're changing.The performance is great, even on my Iphone which suffered on my old G router - I can now max out the cable modem speed when running a speedtest.net test on my iphone clear across the house.  Previously, I was lucky to get 1-2Mbps and now I max it out at 7Mbps.  In addition, I can stream HD video to my Roku while browsing on the other network or transferring files (each operation on a different radio) with no hiccups.  Very pleased with performance.The cost is higher than your typical home router, but so far the feature set and performance have made it well worth it!",,,

This router seemed to have the best like/dislike ratio. The router works perfect. Set up in a few minutes. Works in my Mac only house. I play Starcraft game over wifi without lag from 15 feet away one floor below. While I'm playing my wife can still surf the net with out any problems. I've had it a month and have not had to disconnect it once.It seems most of the negative reviews on this router, and others, are from trying to get more than it's designed for.

72,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,13-May-11,A380ENMW5UTIEI,"Great Router, Pathetic Customer Service","I've had this router for 4 months now.  It has an impressive spec sheet, and despite some short comings, performance is excellent all the way around.  I wish I could say that about Netgear telephone customer support which is atrocious.I initially installed my router as a switch in the middle of my network and had a Seagate Freeagent Desk hard drive plugged into it.  I had two problems:1) My hard drive disappeared about once a week, requiring a power reset or other fiddling to restore the hard drives presence.2) The router will not get the correct date/time from the internet time server.  This means that all the files on the hard drive that's connected to the router's USB port take a date of 01/01/2000.1) Hard Drives Disappears Issue:================================Every Netgear Customer Service representative asked me what make/model my hard drive was, and after citing my Seagate Free Agent Desk or Free Agent Go model numbers, I was told that they were not on the list of supported hard drives.  There is absolutely no excuse for a product like this to be incompatible with any Seagate USB hard drive or any other mainstream brand of USB hard drive.  Having a list of compatible USB hard drives is understandable, but when well-respected hard drives are claimed as being unsupported, then the list is being used as a crutch for an unpolished product.  As it ended up, the list is plainly not being kept up-to-date and all my hard drives are completely compatible.  The customer service reps were just clueless.I stumbled upon a post that suggests disabling the sleep function built into Seagate/Iomega hard drives using a Seagate utility.  That did it!  My drive no longer disappears.  I can't believe that none of the Netgear customer service reps could advise me of that.  In fact, I now have 3 external hard drives plugged into the router through a USB hub and they work great.  It is understandable that the router loses connection to a hard drive that goes into sleep mode.  It us unacceptable that Netgear tech support did not know about this issue with such a prominent hard drive.2) Wrong File Date/Time Issue:==============================I spoke with 3 different tech support personnel, including a supervisor.  After explaining that my router was taking the date/time of 01/01/2000 after resetting and was never updating the the correct/current time, I was asked by every representative what time zone I had set my router configuration set to.  How could a wrong time zone setting result in a date/time that was off by 11 years?  There is no way to manually set the date/time.The issue is this:  If you are using your router like a switch where you are not using the WAN port but instead have you router connected to your network via one of its ethernet ports, then the router will not be able to check for internet time (nor will it be able to download its own firmware updates).  Silly.  I can't understand why the router would have this limitation.  But, if you set up your network such that you are using the router's WAN port, these features work great.  This too should be a simple problem to diagnose for Netgear's customer support.Conclusion:===========1) This is a great router and it beats almost all consumer routers available today.  Even its successor, the WNDR4000 isn't that much better.2) You CAN plug in multiple hard drives though the use of a USB hub even though netgear will not comment on this at all, either way.  You can only plug in storage devices and cannot plug in printers.3) You must disable your hard drives' sleep feature.4) If you need accurate time/date (like any NAS user would) you have to plug the router directly into your modem via its WAN port.5) If you are familiar with networking, save your time and frustration and don't bother calling Netgear's customer support.",,,

90,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,8-May-11,A2LA69RF9TJYJ0,Good Router: Increased Rang and Speed,"So normally I don't hand out 5 stars to products unless they are flawless, but I felt obligated to because of all the unwarranted negative reviews.  This router would be about a 4.5 normally.First things first, many of the reviews focused on the BAD firmware that the router shipped with.  Before connecting the router to the internet, I had the latest firmware ready to update the router with.  The router shipped with version 1.0.0.6 and the latest was 1.0.0.8.  The new version of the firmware worked fine.  The process takes three minutes once you log into the router.I am upgrading from a 4-5 year old netgear router that I bought on black friday for $25, so the increase in features was a little overwhelming.I have moderate knowledge of computers, and I was able to setup the router without using the CD that came with it.  All you need to do is login, change the password, SSID, and set up security.The reason for the upgrade from the old router is that I have Directv now, which is plugged into the router, and for some strange reason IP conflicts were consistently happening which was causing me to have to restart the computer.  I've had this router for a few days now and it seems to be better.One thing to note RE a few reviews that I have read.  If you have DSL, the quality of your signal depends on how far you are away from the 'switching station' in your neighborhood.  The further away you are, the worse the signal.  And it is sporadic.  Some days it can be good, some days it can be bad.  It is not the routers fault.  You may think anecdotal that it, but check out posts on the topic.  A cable modem is the only way to have a fairly consistent connection.The range is definitely better.  The areas of the house where I was getting a 'Very Good' signal are now 'Excellent'.  Is the router worth $130, that is the question.  But no doubt is the range better, and it made my problems better.People--this router rocks.  Upgrade the firmware!!!!!",,,
93,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,7-May-11,A112N37IP3Y1HI,Excellent Wireless Router,"I purchased this recently because I had upgraded to Cable internet from DSL. My DSL router was a combo modem/router, so I bought this one for my cable connection. My previous DSL unit was also a Netgear wireless and it was extremely easy to set up, so that's why I purchased another Netgear for cable internet. Again, it was extremely easy to set up, no glitches during the install, it pretty much automatically detected everything for me, except I set up my own passwords, security, etc. In a two-story home, I can connect with my laptop wireless downstairs inside a room with the door closed - no problem. I can also connect anywhere outside in my yard with all doors and windows closed. My home and yard are not large, but the range works for me.I've used other brand modems/wireless routers in the past and did have some difficulties with set up and had to contact tech support. I really love the ease of set up with the Netgear routers. I've not had to reset the router yet either as I've had to do with a previous different brand.For my cable connection, I am using a Zoom cable modem, which is connected to this Netgear router. No problems setting them all up, they work perfectly together. I've had no issues whatsoever connecting my laptop, netbook, or iPod touch to my network either. I do not notice any speed lags with any item either while wirelessly connected.I believe this is capable of connecting USB units, such as a hard drive, to share over a network, which is a nice plus, though I've not done this yet. I really love this one and have already recommended it to others I know.",,,
94,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,7-May-11,A6WYD3D8C2KU7,Rock-solid fast stable router,"Extremely pleased with this router!I've had this router in service for about 8 months now and have not had to reset even once, despite multiple power outages, power blips, thunderstorms, etc. The dual band capability together with gigabit wired ethernet is great for connecting my numerous devices, ranging from various notebook computers new and old, fast new Win7 desktops, older Linux desktops, smart phones, etc. I have not tried to connect any A/V devices, so can't comment on that.I also have connected a 2TB Seagate external drive to the USB port, which I use for backups. Although the USB is slow compared to the wired ethernet it also works flawlessly. Before connecting the Seagate drive, I attached it directly to a computer and reformatted the drive, deleting all preinstalled software. It was then plug and play ready for the router and worked perfectly immediately. One feature I would have liked would be ability to create subdirectories on the external drive, each with it's own unique password, but then this is a router, not a server. You can password protect the external drive using the router admin password, but then that applies to the entire drive.Administration of the router is very easy using the web interface.",,,
97,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,2-May-11,AZCM3ZS1G5GAK,AWESOMEEEEEEEE !!!!!,"I bought this router like 2-3 days ago and I've had no problem with this awesome product so far...The thing which is important for everyone is the ease of installation and getting the router to work ... It's so easy and I got it to work in 1-2-3 ... All I did was following the tips on the manual and it started to work like a charm in like 2 minutes or so.Secondly, I want to insist on a special feature on this router, called Live Parental Control. Well the service itself isn't perfect, as no single parental control service is but if you've kids at your home, and if you're worried about explicit sites and stuff, then this router is the best one for you. You can use the Live Parental Control service along with another feature included on the router, called Content Filtering which helps you block certain websites using keywords and URLs. Live Parental Control plus the Content Filtering feature makes a totally safe network for your home such that nobody can visit sexual websites and sites with explicit contents anymore, except for the ones who are really EXPERT. Moreover, you can easily set up a bypass account for you and anyone at your home who likes to have a full access to the internet.Range and speed are awesome either. In my two story house, everybody has an access to the internet with the full speed and we we can even enjoy surfing the net in the balcony which didn't used to have an internet because of my old router.The other thing which used to get on my nerves on my old router was the restarting the device and stuff ... Well in these 3 days, I haven't restarted the router even once and it's working like charm; no weak signal, no low speed and nothing bad about this part.Streaming HD videos, lag-free gaming and many other features are there for you to enjoy!Well I gotta ultimately admit that this product was a bit pricey, but I'm totally satisfied with this router; at least in my case, I already got my money's worth.This router is totally recommended ...",,,

No drop-outs (that we've noticed).  We are using the primary wireless as a secure wireless bridge (with the WN2000RPT), and using the guest network for 'standard' wireless connections.  The guest network feature is very nice in that those users cannot (selectable) see the devices associated with the secure wireless bridge.The bridge is set-up between two buildings, about 130' line-of-sight.  Signal is strong and reliable; in fact the users on the wired connections of the WN2000RPT were surprised to find they are actually on a wireless network.",,,

Within twenty minutes the system had downloaded and updated its firmware.  I haven't tweaked its configuration since.PROs: Well built, can be hung on a wall. The router does not heat up too much. Configuration is easy and there is plenty of context sensitive help.CONs: Rudimentary parental controls. 5G wireless band is short range (though about equal in range to other routers I tried).I really don't have much more to add except to say that this router has increased the overall throughput and reliability of my network. I think this is because the firmware just works, the router has a fast CPU, and the router is provisioned with large amounts of RAM onboard.For me, this router is nearly perfect because once I set it up I could forget it.",,,

111,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,25-Apr-11,A1PU3S87WFN7PT,Wireless N Router,"I was looking to upgrade the home office from old school to the new N-Wireless technology as I was stuck at a 100 mbps connection at home utilizing the G Wireless connection that lead to timeout issues and having to reset the router frequently so that all of the wireless devices in the home including Wii, PS3, 2 desktop computers, 1 laptop, multiple cell phones, etc could utilize it. When I received the package containing the router, I took it out of the box, plugged in all of the cables, went to the router site and set everything up and I was literally online and using the 300mbps connection within 10 minutes. The instructions are very straight-forward and easy to do and setting everything up is as easy as it was on any other wireless router that I've used. You also have the ability to connect to the old 100mbps connection if you have technology that isn't compatible with N wireless. One of the most important things you can do is make sure that your computers and all that are compatible with N wireless and you can go to your device manager and see if you have an network adapter built in that says '802.11 a/b/g/n', then you have the ability to use N wireless without getting an additional external adapter. If you see '802.11 a/b/g' (without 'n'), you do not have an on-board N wireless adapter. If you don't have it, you will want to buy an external adapter for whatever computer doesn't have the capability. I would advise getting an N600 adapter to match your N600 router or any other correlating set. Make the adapter match the router for optimum performance.",,,

I called the technical service number and purchased a GearHead 6 months subscription, since i had issues with my (new)computer and the wireless.  That was two weeks ago.

So, I went to speedtest.net and tested my connection speeds, I am getting almost 8.5 mbps download and 1.1 mbps upload consistently, and is actually better than I got when I had the laptop directly connected to the cable modem with a cat5 cable. We also Skype all the time with family across the United States, so having a good wireless connection was vital. In fact, our video quality is better now that we have the wireless router up and running versus when I laptop connected via cat5 strait to the cable modem.

Had read great reviews on Netgear stuff before and I finally tried this one after the prices were cut by a third.  HOLY COW!  My Comcast internet had been very slow and when I replaced the old router with this one it is multiple times faster.  Was a bit trickier to setup as opposed to my old router, had to restart it three times and it would still not connect to the web, even though it had the green light blinking that said it had a good connection but once I restarted my PC and laptop and connected the CAT5 cable it came with to the modem, it started working but I am not sure if it was because of the restart or the newer cable (More than likely the restart as CAT5 is universal).  Vast array of settings, multiple levels of security, ability to monitor your internet usage and set an alarm when you may reach the limit, if you have one.  Ability to create guest networks.  No more downloading firmware and manually upgrading a router because this one will connect and upgrade itself from Netgear's servers.  Looks good too, all black, glossy, sits flat or stands sideways on the provided stand that plugs into the side, but the glossy surface is very susceptible to fingerprints.  Includes a USB connection for network storage or to hook up a printer.  Four gigabit ports as well.  Price is great for the amount of performance you receive.

It is very easy to get hooked up and started, but the performance was (note: WAS [please keep reading]) horrible until I did a firmware upgrade from 1.0.0.6 to 1.0.0.8. The embedded automatic upgrade (where you click 'Check' to download and install new firmware) did not work, so I downloaded the latest firmware from the Netgear website and loaded it manually via the embedded 'Router Upgrade' option in the embedded menus. This fixed all of its problems.Lots of features: the double radios are very easy to set up and useful if you're wirelessly streaming videos while others are working on their taxes (inside joke, but you get the point). Guest SSIDs are very easy to set up on each radio. You neighbors will be impressed when they see your pad has four SSID radiating from it. Each radio has bandwidth limiting available.

I had put off upgrading my router because it has historically been painful to get everything to work.With the WNDR3700 (purchased at Staples with gift cards), setup was a breeze, everything worked immediately.  Excellent setup wizard disc which found my DSL modem, prompted me for my DSL credentials, and set up the two wireless networks (2.4GHZ and 5 GHZ) with WPA2 encryption.  I was using the internet within about 15 minutes.I had to do a couple of port forwards to get my security DVR/iPhone working.  Everything else was left at the default settings.  I tested my 'internet-facing' security at GRC.com with ShieldsUp!, and I am invisible with no security concerns.  Solid connections so far, no problems noticed.The best part for me is that BOTH of my Xbox 360s now show as OPEN NAT, even when being used at the same time!  If you google this topic, you'll quickly find getting open NAT is hit or miss with most routers, let alone TWO simultaneous 360s!  Well done, Netgear!",,,
147,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,27-Mar-11,A1SRMY900UBEDS,Great Router,"I got this router to replace a 'Not good enough to be called junk' Belkin router. This router is very easy to set-up, has great range, will allow you to hook up network printer. In by care I am able to use my Brother MFC-465CN with both my Desktop via USB and my Laptop via an ethernet cable to the router this saved my from having to buy a new wireless printer. Te router allows to you to set up for a guest if you want and change the password for the guest in no time or not allow any guest at all. The built-in firewall  will stop any one from getting in to you network. The USD port on the back of the router will allow you to hook up a protable USB device to back up you computer or share with ohter people. there is a power button on the back so you can shut bown the router if you need to with out removing the power cord and I couldn't do that with the Belkin. I have not had any problems of any kind with this router. If your looking for a Top Quality Router then get this one I'm sure you'll be as happy as I am.",,,

I was trying to connect my DVD player for Netflix streaming and the Linksys couldn't take the workload.The Netgear router was a breeze to set up and I have been streaming videos from Netflix and Amazon with no glitches for a week.Brilliant!,,,
154,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,22-Mar-11,A16CQSU60YCBN3,Excellent router.  Amazing range.,"Purchased this to replace old Linksys wireless G router (Linksys WRT54GX4) that bit the dust.  Not only did this new Netgear N router have dramatically improved speed (expected since upgrading to N), it completely blew me away on the range.The old Linksys router was supposed to have had the best range in its day.  But in our case, we experienced multiple dead zones, which required 3 additional wireless adapters/expanders in order to get the signal throughout the house (2 stories plus basement).  The new Netgear reaches everywhere with more than 100Mbps, even in the previously deadest zones of the house.  Thus far have had no problems with wireless connectivity on 2 Windows-based laptops, a Windows PC, an iPad, iPhone and Blackberry.  Netflix video streaming to an iPad worked just fine all through the house.Also have a hard-wired network connected to the hard-wire ports, including a back-up hard drive, a Vonage VOIP adapter, some PCs and a Slingbox -- all worked just fine when attached to the new router.Setup was very straightforward if you've set up routers before (can't speak to its ease for a newbie).  I used the manual configuration, logging into the router; did not use the CD or 'Wizard'.  It was quite simple and had lots of useful options.Unit looks sleek.  Indicator lights in front are very useful and easy to interpret.  Having the 4 Giga ports is a great feature.  I do not use the USB slot.  I do not use the 'guest network' option, though it seems very easy to implement.Only had it for a few weeks.  Thus far has been very reliable and has not dropped connection.  Cannot speak to reliability and/or holding the connection over the long term.",,,
158,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,14-Mar-11,A12V0XAICK90YW,Great Router!,"I replaced an older D-Link wireless 'N' router.  I had to reboot it often to get my iPhone, iPod, and Kindle to connect wirelessly.  We got Netflix streaming for 'Christmas' and it was constantly pausing/freezing (thru TiVo).The installation was 'pretty good'.  Their 'Netgear Genie' program was very simple and easy to understand, unfortunately it felt very sluggish and it hung on me twice.  I was eventually able to get everything configured.  It has been running for two days now - and the iPhone, iPods & Kindle all connect immediately - every time (even on a 'good day', the old router took 60 seconds or more for an iPod or iPhone to connect).  Netflix has been running flawlessly with multiple videos streaming simultaneously and no pauses at all - over 6 hours of shows without a single pause/freeze (we often paused every 3 or 4 minutes)!  My 13 year old even mentioned (without being asked) that the range is significantly increased from our old router.  This router has already met or exceeded all my expectations and I look forward to working with some of the advance features as well.",,,

Wireless is now available everywhere and is faster than before. It may be that 11g is plenty for DSL, but for connections between computers on the network, I am much much happier with n.The downsides come form the extra stuff: I cannot get a past transfer from the NAS, and mediaplay to the PS3 is hit and miss.Does not affect the main use",,,

165,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,3-Mar-11,A2G2VXM55Q7ZNL,Easy,Easy thats the thing that stands out.  It took me all of 10 minutes to get it out of the box up and going. Speed to my wireless tv a floor below has increased significantly.  Last time I added a router I had to have it set up by my Isp.  Took me awhile to get a new one because I did not want the hassleof setting a new one up and getting everything to work together.  This was so easy I was afraid I did something wrong.  have always had good luck with Netgear and will definately buy this brand again,,,
166,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,11,14,1-Mar-11,A39UF6OCU4DXTL,Why couldn't I find this router first?!  A beginner's review.,"Well, this is my first Amazon review, despite the fact that I've bought plenty of stuff here before.  I decided to write a review right after just submitting for returns to other routers that I purchased from Amazon:  Cisco-Linksys WRT160N Wireless-N Broadband Router and the D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router.*SKIP IF YOU WANT TO READ MY REVIEW OF THE ROUTER--BACKSTORY OF HOW I GOT TO PURCHASING THE ROUTER!*I wanted to like both of those routers, but it was very hard to with the service they were giving me.  First up, the Linksys.  I had a Linksys before getting FIOS, and it worked fine for us.  It was that basic blue set that you've probably seen before.  Having switched from Verizon to Optimum Online in the last couple of weeks, I now needed to get a new router in that they do not provide you with one like Verizon does with their router modem combo.  The old Linksys was nowhere to be found so I decided to go with the Linksys Cisco after having been satisfied with the blue set (and I remember it was cheap then too, routers now are getting expensive!).  Set up with the Linksys Cisco was fairly easy, but I found its performance to be weak.  I was not getting above a 60 percent connection despite my room being only 25 feet away from the computer room where the modem is found.  It would fluctuate between 50 and 55 and no less.  On several occasions it dipped into the 30's, rendering online gameplay obselete for a while.I decided perhaps I should invest in a more expensive router, since 'you get what you pay for'.  I ordered the D-Link after seeing over 1,000 positive ratings and a 4 star average product.  I wish I was apart of that group of people, because as cool as the router looked, its performance was terrible.  I was really expecting a better signal, in that there were 3 external antennae on the unit and all the claims by the manufacturer sounded like serious business.  Connection was simple, and although my PC was freezing up trying to read the installation CD, I worked around that and simply set up the router through the web browser.When I went to connect my PS3 and desktop PC in my room to the router, I was shocked to see that I was barely getting a signal strength of 30 percent.  I checked the antennae (which are the kinds you screw in yourself to the back of the unit) in the back and they seemed to be secure.  I tried playing around with leaving the doors open between the rooms and all these other suggestions and I barely made it to 50 percent.  It would not stay and simply hover around 30 percent most of the time, 40 if I were lucky.At this point, I had two routers in the house and a 5 unhappy campers who were not able to connect to the internet without being subject to slow webpages and disconnections to gaming servers.  I decided that I would have to throw down a few more bucks then intended and decided to go with the Netgear.  The top of the line Linksys Cisco was a very close decision but having already tried one and a D-Link, I decided to go with Netgear for a fresh experience.WHY COULDN'T I HAVE SELECTED THIS ROUTER IN THE FIRST PLACE!?Simply put, this thing is fast.  More importantly for me, the signal strength is fantastic.  Remember the 30's, 40's, 50's?  My PS3 and desktop PC are now receiving 100 PERCENT signal!!!  Set up was fast, and the Netgear Genie is easy to use.  Even the online interface is simple and I noticed that the router doesn't have to restart after doing changes all the time like the Linksys.  On the right hand side of the web browser explains all the terminology so if you don't understand what 'Router Isolation' or 'QoS' stands for, it tells you right there with it's own scrollbar.  This is an amazing addition to making your router customizable if you don't know anything past hooking it up.  This helps folks like myself if you know enough to get you started with a WEP key and all but want to really delve into the meat of the router.My desktop PC has wireless n enabled and the download speeds are blazing fast.  Youtube videos in 1080 and 720 HD were loading like nothing.  My brother experienced no lag while playing Fifa '11 online (and happened to be beating a certain individual 3-1 who rage quit upon him haha)and everything has no problem finding and connecting to the router.I don't think there's much else to say, other than the unit is a very sleek looking device and has a small footprint for something so powerful.  I highly recommend this router.  If you are worried about spending money on a router, then know you're getting your money's worth here.  Don't make the mistake I made (twice!!) by going for the cheaper router to save money and expect as good service.  I mean, you might be lucky, or you may not need as much strength as I need (2 gaming consoles, 2 netbooks, 2 laptops, 2 desktop pcs, and one external cable box for foreign television use the router at any given time), but this thing gets the job done.",,,
167,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,28-Feb-11,A233RPNLAY3317,"Excellent Router, Easy Setup","This router rocks.  I set it up to run a wireless n adapter from each of my TiVo Premieres.  The connection is much faster then my previous wireless G router.  Don't worry about setting up the 2 frequencies.  Just follow the simple instructions (like 5 steps), then put the CD in your computer and follow the instructions.  It took me like 10 minutes to set everything up. I'm not super technical either.  Got my Tivo's running on the 5GHz network and my other G gadgets on my 2.4GHz network.  Very strong signal too.  Highly recommend!!",,,

I just wanted a router that could support all my household's phones, tablets, smart tvs, and computers for streaming and surfing. My previous one (a belkin) couldn't handle it and froze constantly, or my desktop upstairs would be out of range even just for surfing. I am so excited about this router. I often need help with setting things up (like my last router). But this one had only 6 steps and it took less than ten minutes. It was color coded and easy. I have been using it now with all of my devices, very fast and no freezing. The router is downstairs across the house and my connections are very fast. I know this review won't help the tech savvy people, but it meets my needs and I wanted to support netgear for that.",,,
184,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,7-Jan-14,A32LN3G02LNPM0,Works well,I'm not tech savvy but the instructions that came along with the product were clear and easy to follow.  After a week of usage the signal hasn't dropped once.  Very reliable.  I also like the flexibility of being able to set it on it's side so it doesn't take up as much space horizontally.  Being dual band it is a good investment once more and more wireless devices switch to 5Ghz.  I bought this along with a cable modem to replace my leased Comcast wireless gateway.,,,

190,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,23-Feb-11,AQJZKNYEJQC4B,Good Little Router,"I wanted to wait a bit (4-months) before writing a review to make sure this router did what is expected.  I find the reviews of a techincal nature to not be very meaningful if it occurs during the 'honeymoon period.'  My previous router could not handle the loads that I was requiring (both voice and data) and required constant resetting.  The former router was also a Netgear so I was a bit leery of this one, but due to the reviews, the processor, and dual band capabilities, I decided to purchase this one and I am glad I did.This router is as easy to set up as any other router.  I went to the setup web page and entered in my codes and made relatively few configuration changes.  One configuration change I made was modifying the speed cap for one of the bands.  It came configured at 150 Mbps for one of the bands for some unknown reason.I especially like the 'guest' login feature as I can control the speed and do not have to give out my 'real' password to guests with Iphones.  This is also an important feature for me as I sometimes have clients come to the house who need internet access.  I can provide it to them while limiting what they can see/do on my network.I have to say, I thought the broadband meter would be neat.  However, it turns out that I never even look at it.  I find no need for this right now although if I had kids, I think it would be more important.Anyway, I have had one reset issue since setting up the router within the first couple of days.  Since then, everything has been smooth sailing.  I like that it keeps up with my phones, wireless data, and wired data requirements, often at the same time, with very little extra interaction.  Set-it and forget-it is the way a router should be and I find it is the case with this router.",,,

218,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,2,3-Feb-11,A1IF4VK4UPDRFC,Gig ethernet makes a HUGE difference!,"I bought a high speed router that was supposed to be great for streaming media and video games, but it really didn't help at all.  I took it back and bought the WNDR3700, set it up in about 5 minutes, and was able to stream perfect HD from Netflix.  The quality of video is shockingly good (I'm watching 30 Rock via Netflix right now, and if someone walked in the room and didn't know that I was streaming, they would most certainly think that I had just recorded it in on my DVR).  I read several techno-babble-filled posts that  argued that a gig ethernet connection wouldn't make that big of a difference, but in my case, it did.  This won't fix all of your woes-- if you don't have a strong signal coming into your house, this router won't save the day, but if you're like me and had a decent signal that was being distributed by a cruddy router, then you need to buy this product.

I have set up 3 routers for my friends, 2 out of 3 routers I set up didn't need a wizard they found the internet settings before I got there. All I had to do is to add a password to the Wireless. The range is insignificantly shorter than the Cisco E4200, and I been a true believer in Cisco before, however i just had to return their brand new E4200 due to problem connecting with Time Warner cable. Also a nice features of a netgear routers is the Self router firmware update, All you have to do is to login to your router using the Internet Browser, and it checks for the latest firmware updates.Streams HD Movies to my Seagate media player with Airlink USB adapter with no problems.A bit pricy.",,,
222,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,16,18,1-Feb-11,A1CPRP3VFJRS1R,Amazing Range,"I recently compared this unit with the Cisco E2000 and a Buffalo 'high power' model.  This router blew both completely out of the water.  Transmit power, receive sensitivity, and overall range were incredible.  Unlike the Cisco E2000, this unit is not pretty and will not sit just anywhere in your house without complaints from the aesthetically inclined.  But, if you can afford it and want longer range, this router delivers.Although you can improve this router by installing DD-WRT on it, the router already runs the maximum power supported by the chipset, and so DD-WRT doesn't get you any more range or power than Netgear gives you with the default firmware.  DD-WRT does give you an enhanced feature set and it is relatively easy to install (although harder to uninstall, so make sure you understand how to do it before you do it).If you find your range suffering using this router, I highly recommend that you download a Windows program called inSSIDer.  This will allow you to see all other Wifi devices in your area, and allow you to pick a channel that is clearest.Alternatively, you can just try out channels 1, 6, and 11 and compare them.  Because of the overlapping nature of Wifi channels, you should never use any channel other than 1, 6, or 11 anyway.  For an explanation as to why, do a google search on selecting the correct channel for wifi.If you need longer range than this router delivers, the best bet is to buy two and deploy them both in separate areas in your home.  Connect one to your internet connection (the 'Primary Router').  Turn off the DHCP server on the other (the 'Secondary Router') and set its IP address to a static IP address outside the DHCP range of the Primary Router (try 192.168.1.250).  Set both units to different channels (either 1, 6, or 11, and no others).  Set both to use the same SSID and set both to use the same security method (WPA2 Personal - AES) and the same passphrase.Then connect both together via the LAN ports (using a long ethernet cable or two Homeplug Ethernet Over Powerline Adaptors that you can buy on amazon.com).Viola!  You'll be able to walk through your house streaming music on your laptop or iPod Touch and it will automatically roam from one to the other without missing a beat (seriously).",,,

Since getting this router about a month ago I haven't had to touch it once! Dual band, simultaneous reception is flawless also. My Roku box picks it up instantly and I get full HD content without any hiccups.We have watched full HD movies on the Roku while both my wife and I are browsing the net on our iPhone's while at the same time one kid is on the laptop and the other is on my primary (wired) computer.

232,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,6,7,26-Jan-11,A2OLR547OUPYB9,My best one so far,"I had an old d-link 624 extreme-G that in its old age would quit on me every 10 minutes. So I changed it to Edimax BR6574 N with gigabit ports. It also dropped connections a lot. Then I changed it to the netgear 3700. Much better.1.Stable: the 3700 is rock solid in its performance. I thought maybe having a 2.4 Ghz phone in the room was the reason for the dropped connections in the former two routers, but the 3700 seems indifferent to interference.2.2. Fast: Copying a 7 GB movie file wirelessly from my computer to the NAS drive took 23 minutes with the D-link 624 G, 13 minutes with the Edimax N, and 7 minutes with the Netgear 3700.3.Fast: The 5Ghz network gives a transmit rate of 270-300. The 2.4Ghz b/g/n network transmit rate is 130 on N.4.Versatile: I configured 3 networks to work simultaneously: 5 Ghz for video streaming, 2.4 Ghz for general use and a 2.4 Ghz network for guests. This way they don't step on each other's toes.5.Video streaming: On the D-link it was next to impossible. Hiccups, stuck picture, etc. On the Edimax N it was better, with only occasional hiccups. On the Netgear 3700 it's perfect. Not one lost frame. The configuration lets you tick 'enable video network' in the 5GHz to ensure smooth video streaming.6.Range: the 5 Ghz range is shorter than the 2.4 Ghz N, but is better for video at not-too-far a range. The 2.4 Ghz range is as good as the Edimax and far better than the D-Link.7.Easiest setup: You don't need the installation CD. Just type [...] and you get the router configuration screen divided to 3 parts: The left part is the menu. The middle part is where you configure the different things. The right part is a detailed guide that explains every configuration variable in easy language. If you're not sure how to configure something, just read the adjacent explanation on the right part of the screen. It's the best laid out configuration scheme of any router I tested. No need to be tech savvy and no more guesswork.Sometimes you may type the address and be redirected to Netgear's website. In this case type [...] and you'll get back into the router configuration. Just in case, once you're in the router configuration, bookmark it in your browser and you'll never be redirected away again.8.I haven't explored all the other features yet, but seems I don't need them.9.I bought it for $149.99 but the price dropped since last month to $129.99. They are getting ready for the new models - 3800 and the 450MBps model. But I don't need any more bells and whistles than the 3700.",,,

The difference between the two is like night and day.  I was constantly losing the signal with the D-Link.  I run my iPod Touch and Wii gaming systems off of it.  This Netgear router was super easy to set up and it hasn't dropped the signal once since installing it. It's been about a month now.  My iPod and Wii are immediately connected when I activate those features.  It was set up and forget with this router.  It will be nothing but Netgear for me from now on!,,,

So I had been so pleased with Netgear that I wanted to stay with that brand.I found this N600 Dual Band router and felt it offered great features for a good price. I purchased it and am glad I did. This is a great wireless router. I was expecting to experience a bit of difficulty getting it set up as my last two routers (one linksys - a pain to set up and the netgear with a little better set up than linksys)were a bit of a pain to get working. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the simplicity of the setup. I practically plugged it in and it works. Following the setup guide everything went smoothly. My Macbook began working with either the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies with no problems.I then began setting up our Windows Vista. I've had a little more problem with this system staying connected, but I cannot contribute it to the wireless router. I'm thinking it's possibly the wireless mini card installed in the Windows system. But when the system recognizes the wireless, it works great.Adding wireless printers and other devices are a snap. Just begin the setup, push the 'Push and Connect' button and it does everything else for you. Fast and easy. I had my whole network up and running within 45 minutes. It was great!The connection speed is very fast and works well when I have to VPN into work when I work at home.This was a wise and sound purchase and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fast router that is easy to install and use.",,,
238,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,2,23-Jan-11,A35V918W68K5OZ,Fantastic!,"This product doubles our existing range on our wireless. My daughter has a room in the attic upstairs and she used to not be able to receive a proper signal up there. Now she can easily use her laptop, xbox 360, and ps3 without a single complaint. My favorite feature, is that this specific device creates two separate bandwidths increasing the number of devices we can support with our internet. We have Charter, unfortunately, and they've cut their services by over half.  You now have to pay an extra 25 on top of the already high costing internet to receive the same speed you had before. With this we don't have to pay for the upgrade, and we can still use all of our electronics. No more computers being dropped because of low bandwidth, no more stalling on xbox live. Just fantastic. I'm thinking we might be able to switch to a more cost effective company for internet soon and still be able to run multiple devices.",,,

Since switching to FiOS a few years ago, I've had wi-fi connectivity issues with several laptops, hand-held games (Nintendo DSi), Apple products (iPods & iPad), smart phones, wireless printers, and NAS devices.  Obviously, the FiOS router is pretty useless alone.  I replaced the Actiontec router with this Netgear router and setup my local network on the Netgear.  So far, it has been wonderful.  Lightning fast wi-fi performance and everything connects reliably.  I have not encountered a single connectivity issue yet.  I run all of the aforementioned devices as well as two large LED televisions and a wi-fi enabled home theater system through the Netgear and everything works flawlessly together.  The dual band functionality works fine and the guest network is a great feature for providing internet connectivity to visitors without opening up your local network to them.  My kids play several online games on computer and PS3.  They have not reported any problems with the new router.  So far, the WNDR3700 has solved several wi-fi connectivity issues in my household.  I recommend this router to anyone looking for a decent router, but I especially recommend it if you currently rely on the Actiontec FiOS router.  Trust me, the difference is night and day.",,,

This router fit the bill and it's the first NetGear router I've owned. Very easy setup if you are familiar with wireless routers. After configuring I tested my iPhone's connection to it, just like before (other reviews mentioned that they had to reconnect these devices to the new network, not so here). In other words, it's easy to replace an existing wireless network with this baby. Then I set up the 5Ghz network and the guest network, easy. Connected a 1.2TB USB drive to the router and customized the share info, again very easy. Never even opened the instructions, just glanced at the back of them while still wrapped in plastic to see the admin password (password). Did all setup through the browser of course (I never use the wizard, ick..)My hard-wired computers didn't have any problems connecting to the new router, it was seamless and transparent. All in all about the easiest wireless setup I've done. I have an XBox 360, Wii, DirecTV DVR, two desktops, several laptops, two iPhones, and expected at least some issues. Nope, it just worked. Very happy. I didn't grade the connection strength because honestly I don't know if it is better yet.",,,

I am a relativly low tech person so this was important to me. This router replaced a Linksys wireless router which didn't have enough 'punch' to provide a usable signal to my basement home theater which is two floors below the router location. With the Netgear router I now have a strong signal there and I am very pleased with all aspects of the WNDR3700 Netgear router. It has been flawless so far.,,,
251,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,16-Jan-11,A1CW4R44FMS83M,"Great router, if you don't buy it refurbished","I purchased a WNR3500v2 router at Best Buy and it was dead in 11 mos. Best Buy allowed me, with proof of purchase, to trade in my old router and pay the difference on the new one. The new one is the WNDR3700 and this thing is a beast. After reading many of the negative reviews of this device, I simply don't agree...unless you bought a refurbished unit. This router has so many options and so many configurations that it's impossible not to like. Sure every now again electronics go bad. The speed is also great when you pair it with a DOCSIS 3.0 modem. I've got it attached to a Motorola SB6120 surfboard extreme modem and it's blazing fast. I'm able to stream 720p movies from my laptop to my Xbox 360 to my tv while my wife watches Netflix on a different laptop and there is no freezing, buffering..waiting at all. One small piece of advice that makes a huge difference in the performance of this router....Don't use a standard surfboard or other modem with it, you must use a DOCSIS 3.0 capable modem. If you don't, your speeds will suffer largely by comparison...I'm talking a difference in 20-30 Mpbs.Pros-Blazing Fast speed in both bands (2.4 and 5)-alternate on/off buttons for wireless transmission and router (either turn off the signal or the entire router)-Ports recognize if there are no Cat cables attached to it and adjust power accordingly to each individual port. You can set transmission power in the online configuration (25, 50, 75 or 100 percent)-4 x Gigabit ports-Websetup is easy, even if you've never set up a router before. Do what most people do, open a separate window if you have questions on how to configure it and search the WWW.Cons-Really haven't found any yet, it does what I need it to do.The one thing that will make the biggest difference in the performance of this router is the modem that you have attached. DO NOT USE ANYTHING LESS THAN A DOCSIS 3.0 capable modem.If you have any additional questions email me at halo_snooze@yahoo.com",,,

Finally, when downloading PS3 game updates, the Network would slow to a halt for the other devices.The step up was extremely easy.  Had all devices hook up within 15 minutes. We have 3 laptops, Blue-Ray player for Netflix, a PS3, and xbox360.  Netflix downloads are significantly better, as are PS3 gaming downloads. No more dropping connections, or slow network when downloading PS3 game updates.  Very pleased.  Well worth the extra money. Hopefully, it will be reliable. Time will tell.",,,
254,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,13-Jan-11,A2EJBJUBADI3GA,It surprisingly increased my wired speed.,"I had a cable modem feed a Vonage device feed a Linksys WRT54G to which I had both wired and wireless devices connected.The WRT54G had been a reliable beast until recently where reset-requiring interruptions became more frequent (1/month).I decided to rewire with this device, and surprisingly found that my webpages were responding noticeably faster (wired).  I was quite pleased.  The WRT54G is 10x slower for wired connections at 100Mbps, but I just didn't think it would have made a difference since my connection is 25Mbps.  Well, it did, whether it's the boost in MBPS or otherwise.  Perhaps there was a ping boost as well.  It is pleasantly faster for the browsing experience.  File downloads have identical speed.It was absolutely plug and play, and I was also able to put my Vonage behind my router, something I was never able to do with the Linksys.  Though I'm sure it was possible, I was never able to do it despite the college effort.  With this guy, everything just worked the first time.I had 2 laptops, a network switch, a vonage device, a Wii, a BluRay, a TV 2 PCs and a DVR hooked up to the network and rewired in under an hour.  It would have taken half that if I were better at cutting and crimping my own ethernet cables.",,,

I noticed in the December issue of MaximumPC, they tested several wireless routers and the WNDR3700 came out on top.After reading through 35 pages at the NetGear forum  ([...])  They have determined that the WNDR3700 and the WNDR37AV is the exact same router!Apparently NetGear changed the name to appeal to a different market set since the 37AV mentions 'Video and Gaming' in it's description.  They even sell for the same price on Amazon.  A v2 is supposedly in the works but appears to be several months away",,,
261,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,2,7-Jan-11,AIGVD0Y1R4X7X,This router is a Class Act. Highly recommended.,I recently upgraded to this Netgear N600 Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router WNDR3700. The installation took about 10 minutes. It works like a charm. The N-level connection worked with existing equipment right off the bat. The security setup was close to intuitive and quite simple. The Gigabit connections to connect to my desptop (or laptop if I so desire) work seemlessly. Not a single hitch. Perefect from the time I opened the box. I sue the router in conjuction with a Logitech Squeezebox Duet for streaming music. It works like a dream. No breaks. Not Wi-Fi interference on VoIP phones or other Wi=Fi connections. This is a five star recommendation.,,,

This router had four wired LAN connections (exactly the number I needed), and it allows my son to use his wireless laptop while home from the Army.  We even set up all our Blackberry phones to use the wireless for browsing at home...even though I don't pay for T-Mobile's Internet access.Installation from the CD was easy and it also gives you the option to update your firmware to the latest version.  My speed has been good but it's early to tell.  My next step is to acquire a wireless adapter for my Blu Ray player to use the 5 Ghz speed for accessing Netflix movies (once I have an account).  That will be the real test for streaming video.But overall this router is working as advertised and easy to set up.  It even guides you through creating a wireless access point, including a good password so others cannot access your router.Many of the reviews are older so make sure you take that into account.  I believe many of the issues older than 6-12 months have been fixed in the latest version you can get in the stores.  Good luck!",,,

Did not use the Netgear CD at all; the router connected to the ISP without any help on my part. Just went through the menu items one at a time, and 30 minutes later I was enjoying faster throughput with my wired and wireless devices. Wireless PCs throughout my medium-size condo are all reporting 300 speed.The dual-band and guest-network features are very useful and are easy to set up.Haven't tried the USB connection and probably won't, as I have a Synology DiskStation.The firmware upgrade process is a smooth one.I have about 15 devices with MAC addresses in my home and they're all performing perfectly.This is a really, really good router and I'm glad I bought it.",,,
267,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,2,3-Jan-11,A2MNE7SOO253V3,Working perfectly!,Installed my network after Christmas as planned.  Went flawlessly.  Set up router via web interface instead of CD and this way was probably as easy as using CD.  Also plugged in my 1TB WD backup drive so all 3 of my computers can access it.  Downloads from USB drive are good although the uploads to it could be faster.  Also connected HP Photosmart C6280 and that connection also works great.  Really working as expected of course I did research quite a few routers before purchasing this one and it is living up to my expectations.Only thing which is very minor is they could have included mounting screws with it as I had to search around to find just the right ones.  I chose to mount it on the wall rather than taking the chance it would get knocked off the desk.I would recommend this router to anyone although a novice may want to use the CD to set it up.,,,

274,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,30-Dec-10,AIMB8TU76MCUY,Netgear WNDR3700,"I bought this router as an upgrade to the Linksys Dual Band (A+G) Wireless router I had been using previously.  I have been connecting many more devices to my home network and reliability and bandwidth were becoming issues.  I was streaming Netflix to both my Xbox and Blu-Ray player and was beginning to see consistent dropped connections from the Linksys.  So it was time to start upgrading to the new wireless N band of spectrum.  Issue was I still had several devices which were capable of wireless G.  Liking the dual band option of the Linksys, I went in search of something similar for a new router with the new N band included.  I looked across all the main networking equipment providers (Linksys, Netgear, Buffalo, etc.) and settled on the Netgear WNDR3700.  All I can say is that I am not disappointed in my decision!!!This router is great.  It has dual band wireless (N & G) as well as a USB port for connecting a external drive which can be shared over the network.  Amazingly enough, this is a tremendous feature which should not be overlooked!  Setting this up is a snap and I now I have access to my movies, music and files from any computer in the house!The router performs very well.  The N band signal strength could be better but with a simple upgrade to N band wireless adapters it performs much better.  I am no longer dropping the connection when streaming on the N band to my devices as well as maintaining a connection on G band computers or other devices (i.e. my son can watch movies on my Xbox streaming Netflix while I continue to work on my laptop upstairs...  this was not the case with my old Linksys).If you are thinking of upgrading to wireless N (and you should), then this is the router for you!",,,

I wanted reliable simultaneous dual band support and so far I have only needed to reset it once in the past month.I was annoyed with the configuration of DHCP ranges and static DHCP addresses (it deleted the static address mappings when I changed the DHCP range to no longer cover those addresses in an apparently futile attempt to segregate known from dynamic addresses by CIDR block) but aside from that everything else was fairly straightforward.The range is solid throughout my two story drywall house and out to the back yard...much better than my old router, but I have moved the unit antenna position to be more favorable so that isn't exactly a fair comparison.Anyway, no complaints to date, which is more than I can say for the previous unit.",,,
277,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,2,27-Dec-10,A1786ZPASERL12,Drop Dead Easy Setup,"Replaced a Linksys WRT54G with a powered antenna booster with this router.  Quite frankly the Linksys with the booster had a stronger signal.  However I wanted to get a dual band to set up a home theater system with wireless internet access since I don't have a ethernet connection close to the TV.  I did not bother with the installation walk through and went directly to setup by entering the usual IP 192.168.1.1.  Setup was straight forward with basic and advanced screens and nice help on the right of the screen.My only complaint, and it most likely is not the routers fault, is if I use maximum power of 300 MBS I get dropped connections with my wireless in the second floor office.  Dialing back to 130 MBS did the trick and the connection is rock solid now.  I really did not need the 300 MBS since I am not competing with 25 other routers in an apartment type building.I like the DLNA feature but for some reason the manual is nearly silent on it.  Being able to hookup a 500 MB hard drive to the USB is nice once you transfer files you want to share to it.  I did not utilize the parental controls that interface with OPEN DNS.  Don't have kids and do not need it.Lastly pay attention to the manual and do not place the router on or near a file cabinet.  I had it placed in a closet on top of one.Would get signal strength of 2 or 3 bars upstairs.  I moved it out of the closet and away from the file cabinet and now get consistent 5 bars in my upstairs office.  I suppose the Linksys with the powered antenna booster overcame that problem by blasting such a strong signal that it did not matter.Highly recommended.",,,

Recently Upgraded the Firmware to Open-WRT so i could fake a Nintendo Zone in my house (3ds Streetpass) and it seems more responsive.Only real issue with this router is the USB port is SLOW like molasses in winter. I had a Hard drive hooked up to it at first, but it took just as long to transfer a mp3 song to it as it does to play it, so don't bother with that, if you want NAS, there are MANY excellent options for around $100.",,,

The unit is the most reliable router I have ever owned. I have gone through 7 routers in the last 2 years. I finally found one that will work as specified and not die on me. Belkin has awesome range and speed but requires frequent authentication which severs the connection for a few seconds - very bad for streaming services! Linksys couldn't make a good product if they had all the R&D funds in the world - daily resets to maintain fast speeds. The only good Linksys products are the ones that have dd-wrt mods (3rd party hacks). 2Wire is good, but not fast and you won't get more than a year out of it.I've had this router for many months now and it is working flawlessly.This router is:FastReliableTrouble-freeFeature rich - many user options",,,

It was really easy to set up. Three laptops, one desktop, a PS3 a TV and two droids can all access the same drive. It's easy to dump the vacation pictures on the harddrive and then view them on the TV wirelessly, instantly. Great too for sharing Itunes library over the netwwork. Have the app on my phone that turns it into a remote for itunes. Nice for summer BBQ, I can control itunes while out in the yard. There are a lot of other features that I do not use. Aside from that, it's been up and running for about 6 monthes and had never failed. Set it and forget it. About the only thing that is a little goofy, is the blue leds on the side.

337,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,29-Nov-10,A22TQDXL3BZFK2,Great Network Upgrade,"After using multiple Linksys routers, this is a very welcome upgrade.  I've used Linksys for quite a while (both stock and dd-wrt firmware).  Previously, in an attempt to save a few $$, I used several routers bridged together to get coverage across our house.  This resulted in a 'mostly stable' network, however under heavy load I would experience drops and loss of connectivity.  Our use is what I would say is typical family use (Inet browsing, streaming music, streaming movies from netflix).Approximately 3 months ago, I upgraded to the N600.  Since then our network reliability has increased significantly.  No drops, great throughput.  The range is much better than what I would have expected.  I'd estimate that the range is 2x of what we had previously.Pros:- Great Range- Good throughputCons:- A little priceyClosing thoughts:I've read where these units start to fail after 6 months of service.  Here's to hoping this issue has been corrected.UPDATE 5/1/2013:Well our beloved N600 gave up the ghost this month.  Our 2.4GHz wireless network started dropping out.  The 5GHz network continued to work fine.  I ended up going with another brand for better VPN features.",,,

My router is used for a wireless network consisting of a Internet-ready Blu-Ray disc player, laptop and a Vonage VoIP router.

We had to reboot our old Linksys once a day (5 years old), so I upgraded our network to the Rangemax 3700.  I couldn't be happier, this is the next 'ole' reliable'  It's fast, has plenty of ports (4 = enough), and exceptional when streaming video through internet or network.  The network storage was a great addition from the old school linksys, however, I expect that in this generation of routers.  Honestly, in my opinion routers should have several USB connectors for shared devices, but I won't dog it for that.  For your basic wired/ wireless needs this thing definitely has it, and works very well for xbox and ps3.  I have the xbox wired and it's perfect, I'm the fastest of all my friends and live typically picks me to host.  ps3 I only use wireless and I don't play online with it usually, but no hang ups.  I reboot the router about once every couple weeks just because a fresh restart is needed every once in awhile.  It's pricey but I believe this is a much better product than it's cheaper competition.  A friend has taken back two cheaper ones and bought one of these instead and liked it as well, and he said he should have gotten it in the first place....  I almost sound like a Netgear rep... but he took back 1 of the cheaper netgears.",,,

I had my eye on the top notch Buffalo router since there were HUGE thumbs ups from DD-WRT aficionados and figured I would give that a try. This ended in headache so I attempted to go for the same setup that I use for my own home which is a Linksys E3000 and that also manifested another headache. Having trouble with Netgear time and time again in the past I was reluctant to give them another go but did some research and they gave this router fairly high ratings for gaming. Setup was really easy and I had the little dude connected and ready to go within 30 minutes (may have been shorter but I fit a snack and a restroom break here and there). So far they've had no complaints with it going for a good few months or so. I was so impressed with Netgear's performance that I purchased a network repeater to aid my linksys' dead spots and it works well also.Thumbs up Netgear,,,

It never worked right even after firmware upgrades and all the tweaks i could have possibly made. So after i bought the Netgear it was like night and day. This router has fantastic range and it's a true dual band wireless N router. Some other Dual band routers will only do 5ghz N and the other 2.4ghz G. This is something important to look at when buying a Dual band router, and is a feature easily confused with less expensive routers. It has many features for advanced users but can also be easily setup by a first time user. I've already recommended this to two friends and they love it. I recommend it for you too.",,,

368,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,4,4,24-Oct-10,A3F8LZOGC32TJF,Upgraded from Dlink,"I purchased the Netgear WNDR3700 to replace a failing D-link DIR-615. The D-link developed a intermittent disconnection from the cable modem. That was happening about 3 to 5 times a day.I have owned Linksys and D-link products in the past and I planned to get another D-link, but my last 3 D-link units all developed some kind of component failure, so I decided to look for another vendor. I don't hate D-link products and most vendors are using Atheros or Broadcom components anyhow. I just wanted to try another vendor.I choose the WNDR3700 for the fact that it supported 802.11a,b,g,&n. There is a lot of WiFi routers in our neighborhood and I wanted 5Ghz to have cleaner spectrum over the very busy 2.4Ghz spectrum.After 30+ days of usage the WNDR3700 has performed great. The 5Ghz shorter range is great, it covers in the house, but I can hardly detect it outside the house:)An added feature is the guest WiFi zone. I have used this a couple of times when we have friends and family staying over. It allows me to give them internet access to laptop's, iPod touch, & a couple of Nintendo DSi's without me give them my WPA security code or have access to our computers over the router.Overall this has been a very good router. The only con I would have to ask for a little more internet security options, but if I find that its not good enough I'll look at DD-WRT or others to replace the Netgear operating software. Until then I'm happy with this router.",,,

The signal is great for my wireless Roku - it runs like a champ.  Streaming videos and tx large files are fast on my laptop.  The price was a little on the high side, but you tend to get what you pay for - and this is quality.  I have a 500 gig external hard drive plugged into the USB port.  The software has a tool to make setting it up easy.  Right now all I store on it are pictures.  Actually I haven't tried to stream any videos through that USB port, but I have no problems accessing the files.Also - I recently changed from phone dsl to cable.  All I had to do was press the reset button on the router and let it and the cable modem figure it out.  Once the units established a connection I simply went in and set up my encryption and passwords for my wireless network.  Piece of cake.",,,

The dual band capability is a life saver for me since I have several computers running of the router + a Tivo that streams movies from Netflix. Setting up the Tivo on the 5GHz band and the rest of the computers on the 2.4Ghz band has eliminated a lot of issues with congestion. Also, other routers were bothered with too many WiFi connections (sometimes 8+ with wireless printers and all...), but this router never flinches. Highly recommended!",,,

No issues with installation, setup, ease of use, reliability, or range. I marked down 'Features' to a 4/5 because the sharable external USB server is slowww and limited to WIndows-type filename characters.

I am very impressed.  This is a great router.  I am by no means an expert, but I had no problems getting this working.  I set up the 5.0 GHz & 2.4 GHz band frequency channels with WPA keys and connected the desktop and two laptops along with two printers.  I also set up a guest network with a WEP key for the iPods, Netflix, and for friends who come over and want to hook into the internet.  Everything works great!  I also want to eventually buy a NAS hard drive and hook it into the router's USB port for everyone to back up files and store music, movies, etc...  I have been using this router for almost a week, and the signal is rock steady and have not experience the signal highs and lows and drop-outs that we experienced with my last wireless router.

The iPhones connect immediately to the home wireless network even well outside the front or back door, and stay connected without any problems.  And the connection speed is much, much higher, even with a mixed N and G network of two wireless laptops, a wireless print server, and two wired desktops. The signal strength is excellent, helping to make our home use of the iPhone tremendously easy and productive.Folks researching this router will undoubtably see the many recent positive reviews of the product (as of September, 2010), and read about the router's extensive feature set.  The initial configuration was indeed as easy as others have shared, and downloading the latest firmware was automatic, fast, and painless.

The D-Link was crap, constant dropped connections and the need for reset all the time, and their 'SecureSpot(tm)' technology was seriously embedded, unremoveable spyware. This router is leagues ahead. I've purchased Netgear in the past and don't know why I didn't just stick with them. It's a good looking router, the reboot time is very fast. On a power cycle (off/on) it boots all of the way up in about 30 seconds. The range is ridiculous, I live in an apartment complex, most of which is now covered by this beast's WiFi signal. The 10/100/1000 Wired connection is also amazing along with the 300Mbps wireless N connection, I can transfer large files on the inside of my own network very quickly without the need for USB drives, and all of my devices can stream content with relative ease. The default firmware is probably my only real complaint. It's more than enough for people who just need a day-to-day router and don't attempt to way over-control their technology, but it is very helpful that it allows you to install the Tomato Firmware to it. If you're a tech-savy person I would highly recommend switching to it.",,,

I would hope that Comcast would utilize the newest devices, sporting the latest technology, stability & speeds... but that's wishing for too much from a cable company that's rated about as horribly as Congress's job approval.So, after replacing the older Netgear router (about 4-5yrs old, I believe), I've noticed a great deal better stability, faster speeds, better connectivity & a vast array of options/customizations that I couldn't be happier with.

It was a little painful to get this router setup as a Wireless Access Point as Netgear does not provide instructions on how to do such a thing, but doing a few web searches helped me find the information I needed in order to get it setup how I liked.  I paired the router up with a Netgear WNDA3100 adaptor and so far streaming HD content (from my NAS) inside my house has been wonderful.  No longer have jittery video as I did with the wireless G.So far have had nothing but a great experiences after I was able to figure out how to setup the router as a Wirless Access Point.

I have to say, of all the routers I've EVER owned and used, the Belkin was the worst and this Netgear is the best, head and shoulders above the rest, even eclipsing my previous favorite Linksys. I won't repeat all the technical features of this router, many others have already covered those in great detail and eloquence. I'll just tell you that I have two desktops and 3 laptops hooked up to this router, and in the 6 months that I've owned it, I've never had to reset the router, and never had any interruption to any of my systems. Even in farthest upstairs room in my house, where I would often drop down to (literally) dial-up speeds if I even connected at all, I get 4 out of 5 bars of signal and 100+ MBS speed. I couldn't be happier or more pleased. This bad boy exceeded ALL my expectations. I never knew a router could be this good! Get this router. You will not be disappointed.",,,

I'm happy with it.,"Just wanted to stop by to say that this router has worked for me completely as advertised, no hiccups or connectivity issues of any kind.  It is such a relief to just plug it in, fire it up, and be done with it!  I have another review out there for a similar router (dual band N) that didn't go so well.  The software that comes with the WNDR3700 is easy to use;  though I do find myself looking around for things, they ARE there.  Would be nice to be able to boot a user off easily, but fortunately that's not really important.  Look to other reviews for speed tests and the like, I'm just happy to have my household online and complaints down to zero.",,,
400,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,2,2-Sep-10,A1MPYKZJ3CN41A,A very good High End Dual Band Router!,"Okay, i just bought a new laptop (HP Dm4t) and had wireless internet before. Through extensive research on the web i finally found this powerful router. This is the most feature rich router ive seen in a while, a little pricey but its worth it in the end due to the longevity of its life span and its ease of use and speed consistency over several devices connected at once.The WNDR3700 lives up to its name! it increased my range throughout my whole house 2500 sq feet, and theirs no speed difference whether im upstairs or downstairs. Its fast, easy to install, reliable and one of the best 150 dollars i spent on a networking device. A plus to this already great device is the 5ghz wireless a connection which is less congested and sometimes gives a faster speed than the over crowded 2.4 ghz But make sure your wireless internet adapter/card supports it! it should say wireless a when you look at your wireless card through device manager. If it does not than you have no use for the dual band capabilities in this router but nevertheless, its 2.4 ghz gave me a promised 180 mbps wireless and 300 wired. But considering that i have a ps3, an xbox 360 an ipod touch and a laptop connected at once this router still maintains its speed.Th only bad thing i found was the limited capabilities with the guest network but that was fixed with a firmware upgrade. I also suggest that you keep the router elevated on a shelf (downstairs if two story) and keep it standing rather than laying it flat due to heat issues and better range. I also should say the first thing you should do is update the routers firmware from one of the icons the install wizard makes for you.All in all this is by far the best router i have used and its speed is fast, range is excellent and is perfect for connecting more than 1 device. The dual band is a plus, it will help if you live in crowded areas but you might notice a speed decrease or increase using 5 ghz and a range decrease. This is one of the best items i bought off of amazon and i highly recommend it for a people who aren't familiar with networking due the the ease of installation. A great buy indeed.",,,

408,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,1,25-Aug-10,A2ROZCZHL7APUJ,Won over spending $250 on other solutions,"I have found that network routers, wifi AP, repeaters are fought with setup problems, poor tech support, poor documentation, poor performance, poor compatibility problems, and incompatibility problems between the wifi device and the AP's.  I wanted to extend the range of a Linksys AP/router by using a repeater -- failed.  Tried another vendor -- failed.  Tried a linksys product, but it would not support the encryption requirements.  I FINALLY junked all of this (which couldn't be returned to Amazon) and bought a Netgear WNDR3700 AP/router Plus a WNHDE111 AP (only).  I ran a 250' direct line from the AP to the AP/router.  I programed each of them independently (by direct connect to a router) and using a browser interface.  (MINOR RANT: their support disk runs only on the junk-windows, but you can use the browser to interface to each unit separately).  After doing this, I connected the units and everything worked as advertised. Thanks to the master programming of Apple's products, Apple determined all the communication parameters in use with NO input from me except for the encryption password. In this case I was using their iPAD.  Documentation is wonderful.  (MINOR RANT: whenever you screw around with routers, you can expect to unplug the Comcast cable interface for 30 seconds w/o the new AP/router attached, and then attach the Netgear AP/router and then the computer.  I can't remember if the documentation mentions this.)  The only negative wrt to the WNHDE11 AP is that it only supports the 'N' protocol; the WNDR3700 supports both N & G at 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz.  Some devices (e.g., iPhone) only supports the 2.4 ghz.",,,

I like that it has an on/off switch in the back so I don't have to have it on all the time.  Range, signal strength, connection have been without fail.  I have surfed the web, downloaded movies from Blockbuster, and streamed video without ever having a problem.  I can't tell the difference from my hardwired desktop to my wireless laptop at all.  Setup was easy with cable.",,,
410,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,24-Aug-10,A3E7OF3TP9LQQN,WNDR3700 is a solid investment!,"The Netgear WNDR3700 is a solid bit of tech. It ends up being one of the more expensive consumer routers, but for some, the dual-band technology and guest networks will be worth it. The firmware is good and updating it is a snap- it can even check for updates every time you log into the console. You can change passwords, set up guest networks, decide what channel and speed you want, choose to broadcast your SSID, security- all the basic features that you'd come to expect with a router. My one complaint is that you cannot change the username for logging in- it's surprising Netgear left this off as it's a simple way to help increase security.I suggest using WPA2 security on your main networks. If you have something that requires older security like WEP (such as the Nintendo DS) I would suggest utilizing one of the guest networks for just this purpose. If it does become compromised, your network is still secure from prying eyes.If you're experiencing issues with interference or have a particularly congested neighborhood, I suggest using this along with free software called inSSIDer. It basically shows in graphical form what wireless networks in your area occupy space on the wireless spectrum. Combine this with the ability to select your channel via the console GUI and you can make this already great router just a little better by selecting a less-used channel.The build quality is solid, though I was disappointed in the stand- it's plastic and not as solid as I would like. I had thought it was metal from the picture. It's a bit wobbly but still holds it just fine. Not perfect, but still good.Overall this is a good purchase if you can make use of the dual-band N and G technologies. I'm running my one laptop at 300mbps and the rest of my wireless network at the standard 54mbps of wireless G.",,,
413,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,22-Aug-10,A39KOY6LRHWDKD,Worked right out of the box!,Had this up and running 24/7 for 6 months now. It took a little long going through the menu and settings and final tweaking to my setup. Also the auto-updater took a few hours to work when it first powered up. Set up took most of an afternoon with the 3 different computers and 6 devices that connect to it but once it was done it has worked flawlessly. The guest net works on the ssid. I know because I'm on a hill in the country and my neighbors are able to use it just fine from 400 yards out! They do have a repeater set up. I recommend limiting your firewall on the router to known unsafe sites and using norton or mcaffee for most firewall and virus scanning. I've been getting measured speed of 280-300 mbps wireless and 500-700 mbps wired. It drops alot during the frequent lightning storms here off comcast cable but the ups I use have kept it all running with no failures. *****Highly Recommendend.,,,

It was extremely easy to install. I was up and running in a matter of 5 minutes or so. I was having problems with disconnects and conflicts with my older router, but this NetGear router is wonderful. It is so reliable, fast and the range is so much greater. I have laptops, desk tops, Rokus, ITouch, IPhone & a Wii using it and we haven't had any problems.

I like the ability to separate the 'G' and the 'N' protocols with different log-in's which enables each device to run at their maximum speed.  The range on the 'N' is greatly improved and more importantly it is very stable.  No more daily router resets needed.  It also allows for a guest log in, was quite easy to set up it's basic features and has many (very bright) status lights to keep the user informed.  The 'Readyshare' feature works but as might be expected is slower than a conventional external hard drive.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.

It took longer to gather up the three laptops, the netbook, and the iPods to change the automatic connections than it took to set this up.  One laptop runs XP and the other laptops and netbook run Windows 7 and I had no trouble connecting any of them to the new network.We replaced an older Netgear router (which, when new, replaced a Lynksys router).  I love the ease of  use of the Netgear routers and this new router has increased range, signal strength, and speed over our last Netgear router.The speed is wonderful - I was able to download a video that took more than an hour with the old router in less than ten minutes.  It has streamed all of my media with none of the freeze-ups that I was getting with the old router.Very impressed so far!",,,

I was going to purchase the Cisco-Linksys E3000 High-Performance Wireless-N Router but, there were a few things that discouraged me.  The first being that the E3000 is not DLNA Compliant, and can't stream to PS3 w/TVsersity or Media Player.  The second was all the negative reviews compared to this one.  Anyway, the only hick-up I had was during installation.  The software wouldn't let me use special characters in naming the router or in it's password.  I thought that was stupid and was about to return it when I went into the advanced settings (under the routers IP) and was able to add them there.

I also really like that there is a button on the front panel to turn the wireless radios on or off for whatever reason.  (I like to turn the transmitters off for energy savings when wireless isn't needed, keeping my wired connections going.  With my prior Linksys wireless router, there was no physical button to do this - I had to open up a browser in a wired computer to turn wireless on and off.)The web-based control panel is friendly and offers many features.  The fact that the software checks for updates each time the control panel is opened (by default) will no doubt keep many users more up-to-date than with other devices that require checking the manufacturer's web site from time to time (which almost nobody will do).The attached storage, via USB port, worked fine with a thumb drive.",,,

It also transmits at N which is great.As soon as I hooked up the router my internet was faster, no longer disconnecting etc.On a positive note I found out I could have 4 networks on at the same time:1. 5.82. 2.43. 5.8 GUEST4. 2.4 GUESTNo my guests just use the guest networks without having direct access to my network etc.The USB port at the back for sharing a hard drive over the network is also a plus.",,,

I bought a Motorola Surfboard SB6120 Cable Modem coupled with the WNDR3700 router along with WNDA3100 adapter. Using the bandwidth speed test on speakeasy.net, I improved my download speeds from 10Mbps DL/1Mbps UL to a very beautiful 33Mbps DL/2Mbps UL with Charter (boo). The only problem I encountered was the 5Ghz signal has trouble getting through walls and I got a 70-80% signal through two walls at a distance of about 20-25 feet. However, the 2.4Ghz signal probably showed up on the computers of all my neighbors for a four block radius. I'm exaggerating, but seriously, my iPhone still had a Wifi connection to my house half a block down the street as I was driving in my car.I was considerably distraught, however with the performance of the 5Ghz network because of the lack of signal around my house even though I strategically placed it at an elevated level  (Near the ceiling) at the very center of my house. My solution came in the form of Netgear's WNDHE111 5Ghz Access Point. I got creative with drilling holes in my ceiling big enough to fit ethernet cables through my attic to different parts of my house. I setup the access points in the three rooms I use internet. FYI, you can buy refurbished ones for around $40 and they work great. Now, I have a TRUE Wireless N Network running at 5Ghz. I think I'm the only one in my neighborhood with a 5Ghz network so speed is incredible with no interference whatsoever. My speeds with 5Ghz are 40Mbps DL/2Mbps UL which is not bad since Charter only offers 25Mbps MAX DL speeds. (I think the tech messed up when setting up my ISP and modem)",,,

It has some nice features with the dual broadcast for n-band and a/b/g, as well as allowing for a guest networks. The NAS feature is nice as well. All of it is very easily set up. Once plugged in, there is a CD to walk less advanced users, but for advanced users, I found the admin section to be pretty good. I also strongly suggest getting the new firmware. A neat feature is when the router finds firmware itself and suggests upgrades. So many great features to micromanage every aspect of a network. It also looks kind of pretty.",,,
510,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,2,4-Jun-10,A3E2ZZB5ZBD1CR,Beware of the FAULTY router batch,"UPDATE July 7th, 2010: NETGEAR fixed all my issues with firmware 68 and now it works flawlessly. It is the best router I have ever own. It never hangs, never drops connection and supports advanced QoS. I can now talk over my VOIP phone even when downloading in multiple threads. The router even has a flawless SIP ALG implementation, which helps to use VOIP phone without disabling ALG option. I tested most of the marketed feature of the router, including guest network, USB drive etc. and all works flawlessly now. In fact to test the router, I have downloaded around 200GB over a week and it never even slowed down. BTW, I have been using the router for little over a month now.This is my first review (sorry for being so selfish to read hundreds of reviews without ever writing one). But I felt obliged to let people know that netgear is actually deceiving their customer by deliberately marketing a faulty production batch. Search on internet 'netgear wndr3700 enabling the guest net disables wifi router radio beta firmware' and you will find all the horror stories of customers who purchased their WONDERFUL (up until February, 2010) router which does not work as advertised (due to a faulty production batch, guest network does not work and cripple the whole router once enabled). I am furious... I consider my time extremely valuable and the time that I have wasted (before realizing the fact by searching internet) is far more valuable than the router price. If NETGEAR could pay me for my time, I probably would be able to buy a super professional series router.Now my main gripe on AMAZON: I love Amazon and they have been so supportive over the years (indeed they have instantly offered me a free router shipped overnight) but I could not resist to vent my anger on Amazon too: the router batch is defective and it is so well known. As the 'earth's most customer-centric company' (trust me, I still believe they are), they should kick NETGEAR WNDR3700 out of their inventory. And people should bring a class action lawsuit against NETGEAR for deliberately marketing faulty hardware.",,,
513,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,2-Jun-10,A3E9SYZ8028B9C,Needed a replacement,"After years of using lynksis products when it was time for a new router, after reading reviews we went with the Netgear.  It's much faster than our last router and needs resetting much less often, although the range does not seem to be icreased any.  Also it appears to braodcast two separate networks which occasionally confuses the computers.  To be honest i just did a quick set-up so there is probably some way to deal with that and i just haven't bothered looking into it since it's a minor inconvenience.  Overall i'm very pleased with this router.",,,
523,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,2,28-May-10,ACNJZ43Y99XB2,Way better than Dlink,"I'm reviewing the Netgear Rangemax WNDR3700 here because as I was setting it up I noticed that it is a part of Netgear's green initiative. The power plug is energy star rated, and the user can control how much power the wifi radios are using. There is also a handy button on the device that will turn it off when you're away from home - if that's what you want. All of this means that the device can potentially save you electricity every month...Now to the performance. Setup was easy, but to be fair I know what I'm doing with a router. I skipped the 'basic' setup using the CD, and jumped into the device itself via http. I had it up and running in no time. I like having 2 different networks off of one router. It gives you a 2.4ghz network that you can set up as b/g/n, and 54/150/300mpbs if you want. Then you have the 5ghz radio that sets this device apart. It allows for a/n and up to 300mpbs. But the beauty is that 5ghz networks don't get the interference that 2.4ghz networks do. For example, most cordless landline phones are 2.4ghz, so is your microwave, so are most video game controllers, bluetooth devices, etc. Not to mention the 13 other wifi networks that I pick up at my house (I guess my neighborhood is pretty 'unwired').The main reason I bought this thing, and the real test that I gave it was streaming media to my Xbox 360 via the media center extender feature. I have a dual tuner video card in my PC, that I use to record TV. Then I use the Xbox to watch everything on the TV via Media Center Extender. I bought the wireless N adapter for the console this summer because I moved into a house where running  a LAN cable was going to be tough in that location. My previous N router wasn't up to the test of streaming content of HD quality though. When I ran the bandwidth test from the Xbox, it always gave me a message saying HDTV wouldn't work. I bought a cheap wireless G access point off ebay, and it was able to mostly handle the throughput... mostly. But, I wanted to really take control of the problem with my new WNDR3700 - and it does. I get a perfect signal to my xbox on the 5ghz channel, and it gets a throughput at nearly 300mpbs... which streams HDTV jitter free...The WNDR3700 fits my criteria of providing an eco-friendly solution to my networking needs. As a christian who cares about God's creation, environment, I want my purchases to reflect my convictions. This one met my criteria, my needs, and goes well beyond. It even provides the ability to create `guest' networks if one so desires. The device has way more features than I need right now, which is nice because I usually end up learning how to use them and then deciding I do need them later.[...]",,,
525,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,2,26-May-10,AY4WE4ONB6HPR,Everythign I Wanted,"I had been using a trusty old Linksys WRT54g for the longest time. I didn't really trust any other routers. Then I got a new laptop with 802.11n support. I also realized all my wired machines supported gigabit. I started to research gigabit routers with 802.11n. This one seems to have everything I was looking for.And the research was exactly correct. This thing is great. I put the 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz bands on separate SSIDs so that my legacy b/g devices don't slow down my n devices. The gigabit is way fast. I setup a guest SSID so that visitors to my house can get on the Internet without accessing my LAN. The Readyshare USB file sharing just works. Everything is great.Not only that, but all this stuff worked right out of the box. I plugged it in, visited the configuration interface in my browser, automatically updated the firmware (worked perfectly), and it was good to go.The only negative with this router is that maybe it doesn't live up to its Rangemax name. I'm in a tiny apartment, so I don't need that much range. However, the range on this is so small that if I go far away from the router, it goes down to 4 bars instead of 5. Not a big deal for me, but a huge deal if you are in a big house. I notice it does have the ability to be used a a repeater, so maybe in a really big house you can buy more than one of these.",,,

It took me longer to unpack it than it did to set it up.  This router was setup and actively connected to the internet in less than 10 minutes.  That is how a router setup should work.  It took another 5 minutes to setup the wireless security and my whole LAN was up and running at this point.  As soon as I logged into the router it connected to the DSL modem and automatically changed some settings so it could connect to the internet to download updates.  It downloaded firmware updates and installed them automatically.  It then asked me if I logged into my ISP.  I do not.. my connection to my DSL modem is dynamic, the PPPoE login info. is held in the DSL modem, not the router.  I checked the NO box and the modem set itself up from there and I was connected to the internet.  Well done Netgear.",,,

I found the advanced routing options easy to navigate as I run a few servers from home and route services to them.I guess after my Linksys experience over the years (several different routers all the same crappy bugs), it is just nice to finally have a router that does what it is supposed to do!Thanks Netgear, keep up the good work!",,,

Noticed the guest login options so you don't have to hand out full access to people who want to come over and game. I have a 2 story woodframe/brick home and get strong signal almost all over the property. Setup was straightforward and there are explanations on the right side for those who don't know the difference between WEP, WPA, or WPA2 security or what port forwarding is and why you might want to use it. Have a Roku HD/XR player hooked up and a home computer. Wife can be on the computer doing all her stuff and I can be watching video streams without bottlenecks. Haven't tried pushing the router yet but since the backend of our data pipe has much more throughput than our DSL connection any bottlenecks will be at the gateway and not the LAN side.

546,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,2,1-May-10,ASIA96N0IITXY,Recent purchase - First Impressions then followup,"I just bought this router today and came home and set it up, so this is a VERY initial review.  I'll have to come back and update it as I have it set up longer.  **SEE UPDATE AT BOTTOM**Previous router was a 5 year old Linksys Wireless-G, so my first impression is WOW, the is noticeably faster!  I've made the jump into Wireless-N technology.  The setup was fairly easy if you've done this before.  I think a newbie could handle it too, but it doesn't lead you very easily into setting up the 'wireless' portion of you network.  It just configures the router with a cabled connection and then you're on your own.Interesting to note that my iPhone is using the 2.4GHz while my laptop uses the 5GHz.  It's like having two routers, hence the name dual-band, I guess. (sorry this is new to me and I found it cool).I like all the features that it offers.  This is truly for networking professionals and highly knowledgeable amateurs.  I am glad that as I learn more advanced things, I will have a router that can offer me these features.It is quite pricey, but you get more control over your network for it.  The Administration pages for this router area also quite easy to understand.I'll return and update in a few months...***UPDATE***So, I've been using the router for over two full months now and I'm still loving it just as much as before.  I've had one dropped network experience, but that could have been my cable internet service just as easily as the router.  I just had to unplug everything, wait 30 seconds, and plug back in.  The big thing I've noticed is the speed difference in uploading and downloading files.  Going from a Wireless-G to a Wireless-N router has been wonderful!",,,

You have to turn everything off before you start, so you must have this info prior to starting.  I only followed the web video instruction and it went perfectly.  I have a Win XP desktop.  THe install may have taken 30min. or less.  The router doubled my range and speed.  Great product, and sooo easy to install.  I almost didn't get it because of the scary reviews.

Initially the router seemed slow. Their customer service helped me trouble shoot and we learned that I lacked the lastest firmware update.

Firmware updates went smoothly.-Good looks: router looks very sleek, shiny and powerful-Performance: FAST. Both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz N-band networks are blaaaazing fast!Cons:-Price: a bit on the expensive side, but is about right for a true dual band router based on the competition (Cisco, DLink, LinkSys, etc)-Performance - 5GHz range is kinda weak, but only while using Windows 7, Mac OS X always has full bars.-Summary: Performance is great! Clocked over 18Mbps download speed from [...] (with Comcast). Web browsing is VERY noticeably faster, gaming - always have full bars and no lag (yet) using MW2, have not tried any torrents yet but I am sure I'll see a speed improvement.Bottom line - if you have the need for a true dual band home network like I do and are willing to invest a bit more in a top of the line kick-ass router, than get this!!",,,

The last couple years I have defaulted to DD-WRT on Linksys routers for reliability and performance.  I recently hit the limits of 802.11g and Linksys AP's in general and was looking for something significantly more powerful and dual band capable.I run ooma Telo VOIP, WHS, 2 WD Live media centers, 3 netbooks, 1 laptop, 1 desktop, 1 iPhone, 1 Droid, 2 Xbox 360's, 1 wii, 1 bridge, 1 wireless color laser printer.  Also have various devices networked for internet connectivity, DVR's, Bluray players TV's etc.  I stream hi-def content all over the house and hit the torrents pretty hard.  House is 2 story 2000sq ft.With all the devices I wanted to support I originally thought I would have to opt for a business grade AP.  I looked at cisco's 'N' stuff and was impressed, the high $$$ kept me searching.  I came across the great reviews on this router and thought I would give it a try.The router is pretty feature rich, not up to par with DD-WRT but its enough for me.  Range is great as I have no dead spots in my home or yards.  The GUI is a bit clunky but aren't they all?I have been very impressed with this router.  Have never had to reboot it, it handles everything I throw at it with ease.  It handles all my devices and never gets bogged down.  I highly recommend this router.

It is one of few such dual-band devices currently on the market that actually has DUAL radios, and as such it is both fast and stable and does a stellar job of supoprting multiple dual-band connections. Don't waste you time or money on a router that isn't dual radio.Knowing what a high-end consumer grade router can and cannot do before you buy will save you a lot of money and frustration. It can provide excellent performance within your home network between devices which have Gigabit Ethernet and 802.11n wireless connections to this router. My home network includes about a dozen devices (Windows, Linux, Android, and occasionally MacOS) which connect via this router's GigE ports and wireless radios, and the connections are rock solid and very vast. While it provides great performance between the devices on your network, it won't alter the performance of connection between your network and the internet.I've installed this router in my basement to minimize the signal 'leakage' to my neighbors. Even so, the wireless signal on the first and second floor of our home is excellent. The wireless signal strength is adjustable, and if you have difficulty obtaining a strong wireless signal (which can cause your connection to drop and retry frequently), the router's configurations allow the signal strength to be adjusted.My home network includes a mix of NetGear switches, older Linksys products, and a variety of other client devices. I've had NO compatibility problems, despite a somewhat complex setup.What's good about it?:(1) Dual radios for genuine simultaneous dual-band 802.11n(2) The GigE switch really performs like GigE (some GigE don't cut it).(3) Strong, rock solid signal from both radios. Very stable wireless connections.(4) Easy setup via web interface from any computer. Accessible for a novice, fully featured for experts.(5) USB port to share a disk across the network.(6) Guest networks can be configured on both the 2 & 5 GHz networks.(7) 1-click firmware upgrades.However, as happy as I am with this router, there are a few features I'd like to see added:(1) I'd like to schedule the radio to be turned off at certain times of day.(2) The ability to do a site survey with the router to discover which wireless channels are already in use by my neighbors.(3) Three user-selected DNS servers when I'm not using the ISP-provided servers.If I needed another wireless router, I'd buy another one of these without a second thought.",,,

606,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,2,25-Mar-10,A11JSNMZFPPLSL,Worth every cent,"I just installed this after having several different routers in the past.  I'm very impressed in the range and speed already.  It's not only able to handle 50mb of full bandwidth, it does so with ease while streaming from a few different computers at once.I live in a townhome where my modem is on the top floor (with main router) and different wireless connectors around the house, including the basement.  While my wife watched netflix on my main computer while browsing the internet, I still had incredible connectivity in the basement (3 floors down), when playing XBOX.  The QoS option is pretty reliable as well, for those who like to game.  Throw in your port for XBL and it'll make sure it gets priority over anything else.One of the only problems I had was with the software, which wasn't compatible with 64bit or Windows 7.  If you know much about routers, it's not really a problem.  Just plug it in, go to the standard address and log in with an admin user/pass... the wizard is in there (if you want it).  Nonetheless, setup was still easy.The Dual band option requires a separate SSID and seems to not have as much range for 300 as 150.  Sitting 10 feet from the router I get 4 out of 5 bars, which tends to be standard with dual band 5gz routers.  It still screams from 50-60 feet though.Overall, it's the best router I've used (outside of Cisco 800 series and up).",,,
607,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,4,5,23-Mar-10,A2L90RS4B7YLLS,Outstanding Router,"I bought this router primarily for the wireless N and gigabit local ports.I am a techy and have a Microsoft Windows Home Server that my other desktops and laptops are connected to at home. I recently bought a small pc to connect to my television which would allow me to watch movies that are stored on the home server wirelessly streaming them to my TV. When I tried this with my old wireless G router, I was getting stuttering and lag.I wanted the gigabit ports so that pc backups and large file copies like movies would go as fast as possible.This router has not been a let down. I read some of the negative reviews before buying the router, but a lot of the complaints were regarding features I wasn't planning on using.As soon as I got the router and connected it, I checked for a newer firmware version. One was available. The setup was easy. I don't bother with the setup wizard as I've owned at least six netgear routers over the years and the setup doesn't change much.I like the looks of the router, I doesn't have a bunch or antennae sticking out (none at all, actually), it comes with a stand so you can set it on end, vertically which helps conserve desktop space. It does have holes on the bottom to wall mount it, it that's your desire.I connected two wired pc's and a wired printer to it. They all came up immediately. The port lights come on a green if the connection is gigabit or amber for anything slower.Next I set up the wifi connections. I had no problem at all setting up wireless G and wireless N networks. Right off the bat, I have three laptops, a tv, a wii, and two iphones connected simultaneously. I like that the wireless N and G traffic are actually on separate networks and not slowing each other down at all.After about a week of running flawlessly in this configuration, I decided to try setting up a guest network. The guest network allows you to have a network that is isolated from your internal network so no one on it can access your other computers (unless you choose to open it up), but allows access to the internet. This is handy if you have friends that come over and want to use your wifi to connect to the internet, but you don't want to put them on your internal network. Now they can have access to the internet and nothing else. This feature can also be nifty if you are setting it up at an office and want to allow wifi connections to clients or visitors without them also having access to your sensitive internal computers.I had read some reviews here saying that the guest network didn't work for them. I had no problems at all with it. I really just turned it on and it worked. I left it wide open so that when friends and family come over they can just connect without any passwords or hassle and my network is protected - BRILLIANT!I especially love this feature as I fix a lot of computers and always hated having to setup the pc with my passwords and security settings before I could download updates off the internet.As for the USB device feature, I don't use it at all (as mentioned I have a windows home server) so I can't comment on it.Based on every feature I have enabled and tried, I have had no issues and the router has been rock solid.",,,

I'm running all of the networks for various different laptops, B/G/A/N 2.4/5 so I have connected and used all connection types using wpa2-psk aes.  N has an extremely better range than the normal A/B/G.  The best I can get at the far end of the house with A/B/G is around 24mb's but with N I can get between 90 - 120mb's and a very strong connection while the A/B/G is pretty weak.

620,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,2,4-Mar-10,A163LIZN6ZR8JQ,Really Excellent,I am very impressed. I needed a new router that avoided NAT issues for use with VOIP applications. This does the trick and has been rock solid since installation. No reservations.,,,
621,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,6,9,2-Mar-10,A1YP16M4OG41K0,"One of the best routers you can get, Loaded with features.","I did a LOT of research before buying this router, if your looking for a top performing router with all the best features this is it. I've been using it for about 3 months, the speed lives up to it's promises I usually have a solid transfer rate. The range is very good, I have not notices a huge improvement with my stock G internal laptop adapter but it's definitely a good 150 - 200 feet through a few walls and a good 80% signal anywhere around the house.I did recently buy the WNDA3100 dual band USB adapter and have never seen the signal go below 90%, I have not tested it but I bet it could go up to 300 feet through a few walls as promised. I always have a good 300 MegaBits/sec wireless transfer rate, and get about 1.5 - 1.8 MegaBytes/sec rate when transfering to/from my USB hard drive I have plugged into the router.I NEVER get dropped connections (like I did every 20 minutes with old my crappy d-link router), and I only have to power cycle it maybe once or twice a month.Some awesome features I like are the ability to add a USB hard drive, and the built in server so you can access your USB hard drive (read and write) from any computers web browser or an Iphone/Blackberry anytime without having to leave your computer on at home. It has a built in Media Streamer so you can stream videos/music/pictures off a hard drive to any computer on your network (I have mine streaming through my xbox 360). There are so many features there is almost no limit.The gigabit ports have super fast transfer rates through the wired connection (at least 6 megabytes/sec) but make sure you have a gigabit lan adapter on each of your devices and use cat6 ethernet cables.I don't like that you can't plug a printer into the usb port to share with your network, but I really don't care since I don't print that much anyways.I spent a bit more money then I wanted to for a router, but I wanted all the best features and I was sick of dealing with cheap routers that didn't work right all the time, so it was totally worth it to get this router. If your highly technologically inclined and have your entire house's tvs/computers/laptops/phones networked you definitely want the best router and this is it. If you just have a few devices and don't need the extra features and mostly are wireless I would go for the WNDR3300 router which costs a lot less and has the same wireless speed and connection.",,,
622,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,2,2-Mar-10,A1QXM2PAYK08GM,Excellent Dependable Router,"Although the CD the router came with would not recognize my computer operating system when attempting to load up, I manually installed it without problem.

623,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,26,32,2-Mar-10,AZUN8D91AKODU,I am thoroughly impressed.,"The Good:- Easy to setup- Fast- Good range (using laptop indoors and out)- Attractive design- Lots of data easily seen from just the lights on the front- On/Off switch- My N desktop connects at 300Mbps, unlike my previous router which only ever connected at 130Mbps- Push-button PIN feature- The UI for setup is easy to follow and intuitive- Automatically checks for updates for firmware- Not a single problem with connectivity with multiple devices (mix of G/N desktops and laptops)- EXTREMELY reliable so far. Not a single problem with dropped connections or slowdownsThe Bad:- A bit pricey, but that is relatively offset by how great this product is- It refuses to make sandwiches for me. I have complained to Netgear and they are promising to add that in the distant futureThis is simply a great router. I have had ZERO issues with it, even after a firmware upgrade (unlike that previous D brand I had, which was a nightmare to own). No need to use the setup CD that comes with it. The settings IN THE ROUTER are all well explained in the detail pane and are pretty much self explanatory to begin with. I like the fact that it shows which machine is using UPnP and on which ports (so I can easily track down which machine is doing what when no one is looking). If you are hesitating on this router because of the relatively few bad reviews on it (like people claiming is isn't 64 bit compatible) then hesitate no more! I did a lot of reading on this router before buying it and so far, it as EXCEEDED the reviews I have read.Just a note. Anyone who says this router cannot be used with a 64 bit copy of Windows just simple does not understand what they are doing. This is not an insult, it's just a fact. The setup CD is not needed because you can simply log into the router through its IP address of 192.168.1.1 and set it up from there. It's super easy. Remember.. the router does not care what OS you are using. It only cares about the traffic you are routing through it.Definitely would recommend this to other people. I know it's a tad on the expensive side, but it is worth every penny so far.",,,
624,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,4,5,2-Mar-10,ALU19AMF0KQKS,Excellent router,"I bought this after a lot of research on the Web. Usually I buy immediately after I do my research, but this time I waited before I leaped because of the heavy price tag. I really needed a dual band simultaneous radio router since there are two users in my house - the second laptop is a piece of junk and I was not planning to buy a separate N adapter for it, so I knew it would be using G while I used N. The simultaneous dual radio in this router was ideal for this situation. Note that if you connect with G and N on a single radio router or on a dual but non-simultaneous router, the router will default to the lowest common speed, which is G. So with that, I finally ended up buying it when my old D-Link router dropped me 30 times in 1 day. I have been using this router now for the last 30-40 days and so far so good. BTW I have Windows XP and I am using a WNDA3100 v2 wireless adapter (which I set up AFTER I set up this router).Setup: I had to replace my old router with this one and the color coded steps made it very easy. In fact I did not really follow the steps and ended up disconnecting the old router 1 step before they ask you to and still the process worked fine. I had to restart my router one additional time though, but I see that as my fault for not following instructions. All in all, it is a very simple setup.Features: I use the WPA2-PSK security feature. Thats about it. I have other tools for my monitoring needs and have not tried much of what is offered in the admin portal for the router. However read next.Unintended consequences:1. I have a wireless printer, which was originally setup to recognize my old SSID. So next day when I go to print, obviously it doesnt work. Rather than fooling around with the printer (its HP and very buggy), I thought it may be worth some time to see if I can change the SSID of the new router to that of the old. And needless to say, that is indeed easily done through the portal. Next I went to the printer admin portal through USB connection and changed the security key. A restart on that and we were on.Range: I am about 80 ft away from the router. I am on the 2nd floor, router is on the first. There are numerous walls and a floor in between. Also I have hidden the router behind my solid wood entertainment center. Makes no difference. I get 270MBPS on the router consistently at that distance. Its not 300MBPS. But that is supposed to be normal. I get 300 if I am very close to the router. Frankly, you should not care about this - the difference is not noticeable.Connections: No drops at all. Not a single one. But I should give the kudos on this point to both the router AND the WNDA3100 v2 adapter. They are made for each other.Price: Yes its high, but totally worth it. I have not regretted my decision to purchase.",,,
625,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,2,1-Mar-10,A22WLPN1SFSTXQ,Best router all around,"I first got the Netgear WNDR3700. I chose this because it is much faster than the older 3300 version and a little bit faster than LinkSys WRT610N. I can't find the web site but one really good one did comparisons for different distances and thru walls and floors. The 3700 replaced a 2.4 Ghz D-Link G router. The D-Link was very complicated to set up a couple years ago but the Netgear was so simple and automated. Follow directions exactly on when to power on/off and disconnect. I picked the 3700 because it had 5 GHz.I used this with WNHDEB111. I bought the pair to use with my HDTV. It was tested to be faster than  the powerline ethernet adapters. I used one WNHDEB111 as a bridge to a Panasonic Plasma G10 in the bedroom (thru 1 wall about 20 ft away) and used the other as a bridge to a Sony 46z5100 LCD in my living room (thru 1 wall about 45 ft away). Have streamed HD and regular movies from Netflix with no problems. Setup was also very easy. Directions aren't straight forward but once you understand that all one has to do is push a button on the B111 then push one on 3700, they automatically sync up. Easiest network setup I've ever had!I've also used wireless with 2.4GHz with my son on X-Box 360 with no problems.",,,
628,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,2,25-Feb-10,A1QTCH5XAIMYKD,Absolutely Love It!!!,I bought this router after I had major problems with a Linksys always having IP address conflicts with the security settings always resetting to default and having connection problems. This router was so easy to setup. My house is full of wireless and wired machines. I have video game systems and laptops/pc's everywhere. I have excellent connection speeds and I honestly have to say it is well worth the money for the router. I have not had 1 problem with the router. I honestly have to say that most of my laptops/pc's run Vista 64 bit or higher and the installation CD won't work with those. Instead you can go to their website and actually get the software for the newer OS. I love the speeds and it actually broadcasts those speeds because it is a gigabit ethernet router both on wireless and wired. I love the USB port because I have a 2 TB external hard drive connected for a network backup drive. All my computers are setup to backup to this drive and it works perfectly. I love this router and am excited to see new enhancements coming to this router and more coming from Netgear.,,,

632,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,4,5,16-Feb-10,A24IAX7AP52SGT,Great product!,"This is a pricey router, and I know I would have been OK with a cheaper option, but I am thinking of the future and wanted to have a router that will not obsolesce in a couple of years.  I was lured by the dual frequency, the gigabit ports and, particularly, the ability to have a guest network.  On top of that, I liked the on/off button and the possibility of turning off the transmission when not in use.  The router has performed great in all fronts except one, which I'll cover later.  Installation was a breeze. The guest network is fantastic.  No more jitters with providing your password to visitors.  Gigabit ports: this is a feature designed for businesses.  I have no equipment (nor internet connection) that reach that throughput... but I might in the future.  I really like how easy it is to turn the transmitter or the router off; in addition, you can adjust the energy of the signal by frequency, which also saves energy.  It most likely saves only pennies in amonth, but it feels good to avoid wasting energy. The ability to connect an external storage unit is yet another plus. The only feature that puzzles me is that the 5 Ghz signal is not as strong as the 2.5 Ghz one.  I find that weird, but irrelevant.  I find that my connection drops sometimes, but I would bet that's more a problem of Windows 7 than the router's.  I just have to click on the connection icon on Windows and it fixes it right away.  I read a lot of reviews before deciding for this model.  Both Netgear and Linksys have spotty issues according to the reviews.  I upgraded from another Netgear router that worked great until... I 'upgraded' to Windows 7.  That one worked fine for years, so I wanted to stick to Netgear. So far, I am happy. I feel I am covered for years to come.  Overall, a solid piece of equipment.  And gorgeous! I would recommend it to anyone who wants a solid, flexible wi-fi experience.  One final comment: read some reviews that bash Netgear's customer service.  I haven't experienced their customer service, but that's the same frustrating experience I am getting from almost every company/brand I need to call.  Company's don't have an idea how much damage they are doing to themselves by underestimating the importance of customer service, and over-estimating the ability of overseas sweatshops to perform such a critical, strategic function.  In order to save a few bucks today, they are alienating their customers and jeopardizing their own future.

I'm not sure I need the dual network capability or range offered by this model, but it's nice to have. Router is plug and play, and no real installation is required. It comes with a software disk but you don't need to use it. Turning it on and off it takes about 10 seconds to reconnect. I like the glossy black of the unit and the fact that you can lay it flat or stand i on its side, a nice space saving feature. I do wish that they had a power button in front or on top of the unit rather then in back, but it's not a big deal. The unit works fine with my LG390's built in N adapter, my Tivo G adapter and my Xbox live N adapter. All connect with ease and I have not experienced any problems.",,,
636,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,19,23,13-Feb-10,A1QZOZ0VRKUOIK,Outstanding! but BEWARE of the firmware upgrades!,"Arguably, This is one of the best home networking routers out there, but with a CAVEAT. To my router experience, no existing home networking router can beat this one. I have been using it for a month now and have never felt better about using wireless but beware of upgrading the firmware.The previous day, I upgraded to newer firmware only to rollback to initial version 1.x.31N.I have setup NAS (Network Attached Storage, a.k.a Ready Share by Netgear) after installing the router. The initial firmware was great, working fine with NAS. Logged on to the router the previous day and it suggested the availability of newer firmware and asked if i would upgrade and i happily hit the upgrade button.Now starts the issue after upgrading to version 1.x.49N, the router started dropping packets and the internet connection altogether. Then upgraded to 1.x.55N and it again started crapping out on me. Internet connection used to drop and i had to reboot my router (loop this sentence a few times). Can someone imagine how frustrated i was? This thing wasted my precious couple hours.Later rolled back to initial version and it started working as before with no issues with internet and NAS.Few GOLDEN rules worth mentioning here:1. People's time counts, so enough testing must be done before releasing firmware.2. If encouraging to upgrade to newer firmware, one MUST provide appropriate instructions along with rollback instructions and make the previous firmware versions available at disposal, so that people don't have to waste time searching for them in case they need to rollback.3. It is advisable to list chronological versions of firmware the router had, when logged on to the router using [...]4. If good sales are expected at the prices one is expecting and targeted for non techies/common people, the product must be flawless. Tech junkies like me can fiddle things out. Do Apple products ring a bell?Bottom-line:Would prefer this router over Linksys routers, with which i had numerous signal issues. My home is now tangle free. It is a next generation router with Gigabit capability and should last long. Expensive, but will cover the price of changing many routers over next few years. Heed my advice and do NOT upgrade to newer firmware versions unless they are stable.",,,

The Netgear WNDR3700 got a very credible rave review on [...] and the feature set more than met needs.  The Netgear router has a solid, no nonsense feel, better range than any of the many Linksys routers I've used over ten years and web based configuration utility really works.Pros: Good ranges, 'green' features, easy to set up separate networks, solid performance.Cons: Minor dings here: - The desktop setup reported my Windows 7 64-bit as an unsupported OS, so I had to use the 'advanced' setup by going directly into the web interface. - Because the wifi network defaults to open (as it does with all makers), I picked up an intruder before I could apply the security. - While the feature is very welcome, the push-button power on/off switch is easy to bump by accident.  A slide switch would be a better design for an appliance like this. - The power cable slips out easily.  It should be tighter and some sort of safety clip would be good.  I use a small strip of Gorilla tape. - The status lights are very bright; a dim setting would be a nice 'green' feature",,,

646,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,3,4,4-Feb-10,A3GD7GY7QVW48C,So far so good,"Overall this has been a good router so far. The only problem I have had is with using the USB port for an external disk. Supposedly firmware 1.0.4.49NA fixed problems with this, but it appears that there are still problems in this area. The only stability problem I had was when I attached a drive (just to check it out) - the router would periodically hang. As I have a dedicated NAS, I just left the drive off. From published performance results in test reviews, I wouldn't plan on using this router as a NAS anyway.When a drive is not attached, I have not had a single stability problem in the month or so I have been running it - the only time it was down was one power outage that exceed my UPS backup time.The wired ports worked great, and as most of my boxes have gigabit ports, I have noticed the improved speed. The different colored port status lights allow you to see at a glance whether you are running at 100 or 1000. (I was able to visually identify one marginal cat 5 cable and replace it.)It is running behind a DSL modem in bridge mode - i.e., it does the PPoE login. No problems. I have DMZ set up to the NAS which runs a web server as well as a common file/backup server. External access through the DMZ is fine.Wireless has both 2.5 and 5GHZ set up. I have run with both WPA/TKIP and WPA2/AES (at different times) with no problem. I have not done any specific distance or speed tests with the wireless so I can't comment on that. Also, I have not extensively tested the QoS or UPnP functions.There appears to be work in progress to bring dd-wrt up on this box which would allow additional features (like VPN) - I wouldn't expect this to be available until mid 2010 at the earliest. However, the factory firmware appears to work fine unless you need the extra features.The price is a little expensive but you get both gigabit ports and simultaneous dual band wifi. All in all, I am glad that I spent the extra money to get this model.UPDATE: After experimenting with wireless range a little I can verify the many comments that 5G is poor. At about 50 feet and through 2 walls I get about twice the speed on G (at 2.5) as I do with N on 5G. (In the same room about 10 feet away, I get good throughput on 5G, however.) I still like the router because of its stability (so far) and the gigabit ports, but don't expect the 5G capability to be a lot of use to you.",,,
648,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,3,5,2-Feb-10,A3M2DZ6L8DLEDJ,Great Router though expensive,"C-Net did not have a 4 or more star rating (3.5) on it but since a great portion of customer feedbacks were positivewherever I searched online, I chose this one.  It took a while to arrive from Amazon but not too long while I could not find it on BestBuy or Fry's shelves which suggested it is definitely selling good. Generally the negative feedback was on less important features for me or as is geneally true, many people just do not know how to operate or optimize the router and fail to get it working correctly.The set up was a breeze for me (I am a techi and am using Win 7 Ultimate 64-bit) through the web interface which has help documentation automatically avaialble for any feature that one wants to set up.  I used the documentation on the CD as well and the documentation was pretty good. I have both channels (2.5 and 5) operating with a guest netwrok, basically three wireless networks at once.  All my devices have 802.11G cards (PS3, Tivo, laptops) and the router is located on the edge of the house (I can not set it up centrallyany). Still I get coverage at all the places (100+) though the 5GHz network has smaller range. I presume if I had the N standard for my wireless devices, the range and throughput could have been better.Per other comments and reviews, the 5 GHz range is a bit disppointing in terms of the range. I do not have a use for the USB but I have heard that the throughput is slow (have to try it once but I do not care about that). Appart from wireless features (it supports all security standards), this is a fast reliable router as well and I believe it should be able to handle many devices at once (I have 10-11 devices connected at once to it).  That was one of the reasons I purchased this because of the faster processor and the ability to handle many devices at once (I had noticed my previous router could choke on taht).I use a ADSL modem (5Mbits/600Kbits) and I have not had any disconnection through the router which I use it to dial the dsl account (dsl modem is in bridge mode). All standard routing features are available for set up through the web interface like port forwading, DHCP address reservation, content filtering, Dynamic DNS, QoS, etc.Overall, I have had this router for about 10 days and aside from the range of the 5GHz channel, I have not noticed anything to complain. On the price, It is somewhat expensive but again $160 on a piece of equipment that connects you to the rest of the world and connects all devices at your home together is not much assuming it works fine which this one has done so far.I recommend this product to those that not only want wireless connectvity but also great/reliable routing functionality.",,,
649,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,4,2-Feb-10,A2EK8D5QRG5VGH,Best router I own by far!,"The initial setup was very easy, and even with all the port forwarding and various other settings I had to tweak I was up and running in well under 10 minutes. Within a few more minutes I had updated the firmware which also went very smoothly.The user interface is adequate for what I use it for. It doesn't have the bells and whistles of dd-wrt, which isn't compatible with this router at the time of this review. Even if dd-wrt was available I would probably still hesitate and think before upgrading as the router is very stable and does what it is supposed to at this point.The network connection is a solid and unwavering 300Mbps, and I even noticed better bandwidth as far as downloads go. The guest networks worked fine for me when I tested it by flawlessly connecting a Sony PSP.I would highly recommend this router. Its better than anything Linksys is putting out at the moment....I refuse to buy another Linksys router after a string of disappointments.For those that left negative reviews, please check your settings again or RTFM. I've had nothing but a good experience and can't imagine why that would change from one user to the next unless they received a defective unit.",,,
651,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,2,31-Jan-10,ATXMLBSSXP0D4,WNDR3700 works as promised,"Bought the WNDR3700 over a month ago. Installed easily and manually configured a dual-band network for N and G in just a few minutes.Range is improved, but N still drops in speed as distance from the router increases. Better G reception than my previous router.Not disappointed at all - has worked flawlessly and was a good investment.",,,
653,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,2,30-Jan-10,A2HC0WQ1ZZLKGM,Great Router,"This was my first experience with a wireless router.  It pretty much worked right out of the box. I didn't use the setup disk as I already had experience setting up routers and switches. I brought up the web page interface to the router and it immediately recognized that my DSL modem used an IP that was the same as the default IP for the router. The software automatically configured the IPs for the router and attached computers to a non-conflicting IP range. From there it was just a matter of following instructions and entering the settings. The two wired XP computers connected with the router right away as they were already set up to get their IPs and DNSs from the router after I edited the settings to Zone Alarm to accommodate the new network IP range. I then fired up the new laptop computer with Win 7, it recognized the new WNDR3700 router and after entering SSID and passwords for the router we were up and running. So far, there have been no problems with the router, but Win 7 gave us fits for awhile until I set up the laptop/router combination to use a static IP for laptop.I'm pleased with the range of the router. I've got it set up on a far wall downstairs to be close to my DSL input and wired computers on the network.  The G/N band 2.4 Ghz signal is very strong everywhere in the house, and the 5 Ghz N band signal is also strong enough to use anywhere in the house. We use the 5 Ghz band to avoid interference with our 2.4 Ghz wireless phones.  Connectivity seems to be a lot better with the WNDR3700 then it was with the old LINKSYS BEFSR41. During the day we often were disconnected from our DSL connection with the LINKSYS and had to force a reconnection. So far with the WNDR3700, the connection has been very stable.",,,
654,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,1,30-Jan-10,A1MP6287CS9ON4,Netgear Rocks!,"If you read my previous review of the Linksys WRT400N wireless N router, you understand how pleased I am with this Netgear router.  I can't say anything bad about this router and can only say fantastic things.  After receiving this router, I installed it and was up and running within 20 minutes.  I have no dropped uploads or downloads, great speed, and tremendous range.  Configuring the router was easy and monitoring the status is easy as well.If you are looking to upgrade to a wireless N router, go nowhere else but Netgear!",,,
656,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,3,28-Jan-10,A1IKFAV2NSEWUX,Best router I've found!,"This is the sixth router I've owned in the last 2 years including a Linksys WRT400N and 610N and this NetGear is by far the best.  Why so many routers?  I have a very demanding network setup including numerous computers, Xbox 360, all running Windows Media Center, plus six wireless security cameras, iPhones, two DirecTV DVR's running MRV (multi-room-viewing) across the network, etc. All must work properly on the network and I've found issues with the other routers but not this NetGear.  Recent upgrade to my cable internet to 40/5 Mbps speeds necessitated a replacement router that could keep up.  Went with the buggy WRT610 which has major security issues where it would just spontaneously revert to factory defaults leaving an open 'LinkSys' network, returned that, and got the WNDR3700.  This is the fastest, most stable router I've ever owned and has by far the greatest range!",,,
659,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,3,4,25-Jan-10,A3FEGTOLCWXSV4,Truly a nice little WoNDeR!,"This router replaced my solid and dependable (but not quite so inspired) Linksys WRT54GL.Its hard to know where to begin with the comparisons - if the WRT54GL is a Toyota Camry, then the WNDR feels like a Lotus Elise.Right from the outside, there is a sleekness to the device, that I haven't associated with routers in a very long while. When you have its nine lights blinking various shades of amber, blue, and green, its almost like geek heaven! There's just as much of a generational difference on the inside.Here's a quick synopsis of this review encapsulated in one word - 'Wow!!!' - hence the 5-star rating.Now, let's dig into the details.Installation:####################This was by far the easiest intall process I've had with a wireless networking product. The software is truly neophyte-friendly, and is complete with animations of the removal of power plugs and connection of ethernet cables. This is an impressive feat and will very likely meet the needs of most first time networkers.Unfortunately, the software won't run under Vista 64-bit.In addition, it got confused when trying to investigate the final setup as I had not powered on my router. Even though I hastily corrected that situation, it simply hung there for an eternity - and committed the cardinal sin of not letting me abort the interrogation.Fortunately, after I killed and restarted the process, it very kindly allowed me to skip the preliminary steps and proceeded to successfully verify the network details.Configuration:###################The setup software was also smart enough to accept key configuration parameters such as the network SSIDs for the two networks (it is true dual band after all), as well as network security parameters.The user-friendliness of the setup routine was apparent in how the wireless security options are displayed, in increasing order of security (WEP64 through to WPA2).One silly design decision, was that it wouldn't accept a passphrase that contained special characters. As a workaround, I specified a simpler password here, and updated it to the final version later.A nice touch was the automatic registration built into the setup process which even retrieved the device's serial number - which is often painful to transcribe correctly.Firmware Update:######################Another example of Netgear's thoughtfulness is the seamless manner in which the router updated its own firmware. On the very first access to the web based administration utility, it automatically detected that I had outdated firmware, and without any further ado, downloaded and installed the latest version, with no user intervention!Advanced Features:########################This router has every imaginable feature that I could ask for, in a single package.1) Worried about sharing your network passphrase with guests wishing to use your network? Worry no longer. The WNDR lets you setup two guest networks, with or without encryption.2) How about installing a NAS device accessible from the various computers in your home? This little WNDR lets you connect and share any USB drive. As a bonus, you can access files over the Internet using a standard browser or FTP client.3) Upset that you have to leave a computer on in order to stream media to your TV or gaming device? The WNDR is a DLNA compliant media server. Simply copy media files over to the attached USB drive!4) Want to discover why you *need* a hardware firewall? The WNDR has detailed logging that lets you see what and who is knocking at the gates of your firewall castle. You'll see entries such as port scanning that have the potential to make you hyper-paranoid.5) Want to keep tabs on your Internet usage stats? The WNDR will do it for you using its nifty traffic meter.6) Want to restrict when the kids can use the Internet? No problem.If its something you can name (say, support for dynamic DNS), then there's a good chance that this router will let you do it.Conclusion:################My only complaints relate to areas that aren't directly connected to the router itself or are not quite so critical - hence my decision to award it a full complement of 5 stars.First, the manual, while sufficient for normal setup descriptions, is woefully deficient when it comes to the advanced features. Be prepared to spend time online if you need to get the most out of this device.Second, while you can access your NAS drive over the Internet, you cannot upload files using the HTTP interface. Furthermore, the only choice when securing it, is to use the router's admin password - a silly decision.Third, adding a read password seems to disable the media server - my PS3 couldn't even detect it any more.Finally, I had trouble with accessing a password protected NAS drive via Windows Explorer, until I simply recycled the notebook, router, and modem while I was on hold with a rather confused tech support agent. The problem then mysteriously went away.Despite these minor blemishes, this is a wonderfully designed product, and is worthy of all the attention that it has received.Happy Networking!",,,
660,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,1,24-Jan-10,A1L3YZI4PA42VD,I'm really glad I spent the money for this,"I've had a lot of trouble finding a router which would give me flawless wireless-N (i.e. high speed) connectivity.  Reading the reviews of routers in the $50-100 range, or even more, it's been distressing to see how many suffer dropout problems, in particular.  I had another brand router that frequently dropped out on me, finally conking out altogether after about four months.  Reading the reviews on this item prompted me to buy it, despite the higher price (about 160), and I'm really glad I did.  Setup was extremely easy; the disc walked me through step-by-step even to the level of telling me when to unplug the current router and replace the new one.  Setting up a secure signal was simple too.  The whole process took maybe a half hour.  Since then, in two months I don't think I've had a single dropoff, and the bandwith (which I check periodically using an online tool) has been consistently strong.  It also has worked consistently sending a signal to my wireless printer about 30 feet away on the other side of my condo.  The other cool feature which I didn't even think about when I bought it is the USB port; my external hard drive now is plugged into it so I can backup files to it wirelessly.The best thing I can say about the router is that I no longer think about having to get a better router.",,,
661,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,2,24-Jan-10,ATDXKP4TJKS4F,"Upgraded from DIR-655, very happy","I had the DIR-655 which started to give me problems ever since upgraded to the latest firmware.  I havwe several laptops and a wireless printer as well as my gaming consoles and media server connected via wireless. I have a two floor house with the router upstairs, and most of the use downstairs. My media server, printer, and hard-drives are upstairs.  The DIR-655 was working fine, though sometimes some of the laptops would have spotty reception. I now use one of the bands with the WNDR3700 for the media serving and the other for laptops. I also have my vonage VOIP connected to the router.  BTW I am using this behind a AT&T Uverse router/modem. So far no issues. My xbox 360 using Windows Media Center extender no longer stutters and NetFlix always shows HD when available. My laptops also now have full-bars and no longer have intermittently slow internet connections, as I sometimes had with the DIR-655. overall, i am pretty satisfied with the purchase. I have been using it for almost a month at the time of this review.",,,
662,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,1,21-Jan-10,AQXOCESFUBADP,Nice product,"This router is reliable with dual band feature.  I have quite a few wireless electronics requiring wi-fi reception, the dual-band is nice for this purpose.  I have not found any problems with this router yet.  I expect it will have none in the future.",,,
666,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,1,16-Jan-10,A25TEJQ12KGGQ9,Excellent Router,"This router is excellent bang for your Buck. Its inbuilt media server works amazingly well with my PS3. Not to mentioned I've attached a 500GB external hard drive, and creating a wireless network is a breeze. I moved from Linksys G-router and so far I've got absolutely no complaints. I have my older Win XP PC running on 2.4Ghz, while my Thinkpad runs at 5Ghz at the same time without any issues. My PS3 recognizes the 2.4Ghz connection and not the 5Ghz, still I'm able to stream movies wirelessly from the attached USB storage on my router to my LCD TV without any issues or interruptions. I would recommend it over DLink or Linksys, if you need attached storage.If you looking for Dual band router that doesn't drop your connection very often. This is for you.",,,
667,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,1,14-Jan-10,AGR96544SBPI5,Excellent features and performance,"This is my first Wireless N Router. I purchased this after some fairly good online search. I have to mention that I'm not a big gamer. So, I do not know how this will perform for gaming. But download speed was my biggest factor to consider. Regardless of whether I really download that much or not, I wanted one that supports very good download speeds and helps me make the best use of my internet connection speed.This router excels in all that I expect of it. Set up is fairly easy. I did not expect to have much flexibilty in controlling or configuring the Router. But this router has a great set of features that can be configured and controlled very easily through a web page. Spam control can also be enabled. One important thing is not to forget the Router login credentials. If the password is forgotten, then only way to set a new password is to reset the router completely. A CNET Review mentioned that the Router does not perform all that well in the 5GHz band. I cannot comment technically, but from a layman's perspective - it performed ok. I was able to download approx 3.5 GB of data in about 30 minutes, using the 5GHz mode. (The modem I've used is Motorola's SB6120 DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem.)Overall, I am very satisfied with the router !!",,,
670,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,5,11-Jan-10,A3QH6WU58YYDYW,Great router - easy set up,"I had this router set up in minutes. It could hardly have been easier. I think about all of the time I spent on the setup of my old 802.11g router, and I am thankful that technology has become easier to deal with.I set up the 5 GHZ and 2.4 GHZ networks and connected my devices wirelessly. My laptop is about 35 feet away with a couple of walls in between, and the 5 GHZ network signal alternates between Very Good and Excellent. If I connect the laptop from more than about 50 feet, the signal drops to Good, and it gets iffy around 65 feet.I can't believe how this has improved my 2.4 GHZ range. I have a Roku Radio set up downstairs and on the other side of the house from the router. With my old Linksys Wireless G router, the Roku was getting signals in the -75 dBM range at best. In fact, it dropped out quite a bit, and I got a range extender and set it up downstairs fairly close to the radio. That improved the signal to an average of about -50 dBM. When I set up this new router in the same place as the Linksys, I got rid of the range extender, and checked the Roku signal. It had improved to -43 dBM. I couldn't believe it, so I checked it several other times over the next few days. The worst signal I got was -49 dBM. The signal quality hovers around 99% which is also much better than it was with the old router and range extender (90% or so).The Quality Of Service (QOS) features of the router work great as well. You can set it up using MAC addresses, ports, or a few other criteria. I connected my Ooma phone system to a port and tested it out. I was getting some latency and annoying feedback. I then set up the QOS for that port to give it 'highest' priority. I checked the phones again, and they were as clear as a bell. I had not experienced VoIP that clearly until that point.This router has easily handled everything we've thrown at it. I was using my laptop to wirelessly backup my desktop while one kid was wirelessly streaming Netflix using the Roku Netflix player, the other was using his iPod Touch on WiFi, and my wife was on the Ooma phone. Nobody had any hiccups at all. I'm very satisfied with this purchase, and I hope it remains reliable.",,,
672,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,3,10-Jan-10,A1VODC6V66PJSI,Awsum Router,"I brought this router because I wanted the best router to stream netflix to my tv using an HDMI cable.  This is a Draft N verson 2 (5gig) so it can stream at 300 mps. It also operates on  version 1 is at 150mps, and on the G standard (54mps)I like this router.  I never have had trouble with it.  It's range is great (even though I only have a 800 SQ apartment (more than enough for a G) I have recived my singal at the end of my hallway which must be about 400 to 500 ft away.  However that was only on the 2.4 gig band.  the 5 GIG band does have less interfearance but it has rather short range but is faster.  Due to the lack of interfearence and the fact I'm close I constantly recive a 270 mbs singal. (thats because thats all my wireless adapter in my laptop can take in.To give you a feel I can download from this router wirelessly HP software an avg of 400MB in about 2 min's and I'm downloading more than 2MBS IT'S ACTUALLY 2.30 MPS wirelessly which is awsum.  T;ve tried the linksys routers and the dlink and I've have found that this router produces the best bandwith output to my laptop.With this router there is a lot more custom control you can do over the linksys routers. This router just like other higher end routers has DHCP Reservation, you can adjust the QOS via ip address or Mac address and I have no problem reading my print server static when it's outside the DHCP range.I did have an issue but I also know that my oringnal wireless print server was a defect from e-bay but the issue would have made sense.  Most of your print servers operate on the G standard.  this router operates on 2.4 which is G and N 150 (verson1)  And this router also operates on the 5 gig standard. which means if your laptop is on the 5 Gig side It might be considered on a different network than what your print server is on so you might not be able to communicate with your printer unless your laptop or wireless comoputer is on the 2.4 band and which again is the (N Verison 1) or G standard.  Again this print server was a defect from e-bay it froze up so I may not be accurate because my other thought is if the print server is commicating with the router wirelessly the router should be issuing the commands on both bands. I didn't try another wireless print server. I'd like to because I'm curious. but first I need to get a working one from the store.What I did to resolove the issue was get a wired print server set it up static and it communicates with my 5 year old G standard laptop, and my N standard laptop at 5 Gigs which means I can opeerate on both bands at the same time wired.I recomend this router I think it's stable and fast it has great range.  For most of you that do care only about the basics one flaw it does have is it has a slow boot up time thing but oh well. other than that one of the best routers I've had",,,
674,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,1,8-Jan-10,A321P24VRT1VT6,Best router I have ever owned,"I have owned a router from every major company over the years but so far this is easily the best I have ever owned.  Even under extremely heavy load this router doesn't get bogged down.  I have a mixed network with a computer connecting at a 2.4ghz N speed, a 5.2ghz full 300mbps speed, and an old wireless G connection.  All function perfectly at the same time.  I do not notice any performance hit on my 20mbit internet connection due to the router.  So, in short, its expensive but I highly recommend this.",,,

This is an awesome router it controls everthing,I have my laptop's running on the 2.4g GHz G network and video (netflix) on 5 GHz N network with a NAS hookup thru a the GB ports. I highly recommend this router....",,,
676,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,2,4-Jan-10,A3UF0EYTG7WNGI,Great for Roku and Netflix streaming,"I recently purchased a Roku (streaming movie) box to watch Netflix movies on.Using my old router, a Netgear WPN824v2, either in wired or wireless mode, the Roku box provided what can only be kindly called poor performance.  I could only get two 'dots' out of a possible four, for movie quality... and downloads were frequently interrupted by long pauses while I waited for the movie stream to catch up.Thinking I could partly improve the situation with a new router, I did some research and decided to get the Netgear WNDR3700.This router didn't just provide 'partly improved' performance; it delivered impressive results and solved my Roku problem completely.  On the Roku box I now get the highest quality, streaming HD movies with no interruptions.  And that is in wireless mode, penetrating at least four walls from one end of the house to the other.  My Internet browsing and downloads are also considerably faster;  here, all along, I thought I had been getting the maximum bandwidth possible from my ISP.  The Netgear WNDR3700 proved me wrong.The attached USB drive feature is also nice, though it requires a little bit of configuration.  As a browsable share, it's a little slow, but reasonable for automated backups (and may be as a media share but I didn't test it that way).Your own experience in speed improvements may vary depending on your ISP's bandwidth caps or what router you previously used.  But for me, this router has delivered an excellent performance improvement.  In increased speed alone, it's already paid for itself.",,,
677,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,1,2-Jan-10,AN5RAGH9MTPCZ,Great for 50Mbps Internet Connections,"After upgrading to a 50Mbps Internet Connection, I discovered that my old WRT54G v3 could not handle LAN/WAN switching faster than 22Mbps.  I selected the WNDR3700 after quite a bit of research because of its excellent performance as shown at [...].  I have not been disappointed. Despite the relatively short amount of time that this unit has been on the market, it has impressively stable firmware.The one con is that NetGear technical support is almost useless if your hardware fails. I had to deal with them recently after a Netgear GS108 GigE Switch failed after one week. I ended up throwing away the Netgear switch and buying a Dell PowerConnect 2708 instead.",,,

683,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,5,7,20-Dec-09,A2NFW8WCUV8F5B,Significant Improvement,"I bought this router to replacing an aging Netgear WGR614, which was starting to have DNS server resolution issues.  The good reviews, gigabit switch, and the N feature really appealed to me.  I have been running this for almost 2 weeks and have been very impressed.  The router setup was almost identical to my old 614 (in manual mode), which made it a breeze.  In addition to the security encryption, I really like the ability to not broadcast the SSID and limit the connecting computers/devices via MAC address - keeps most of the novice hackers in the neighborhood out.  My daughter and son's laptops (running Vista 32 and 64 bit versions) have connected flawlessly and the newer computer is pinging away at 300K Mbps consistently.  Wireless range or dropping signal has not been an issue.  The wired computers are all running gigabit speeds without problems, but I'm not pushing tons of data or streaming over them either.  Have not tried the guest account features since I don't have a requirement for that function.  Unlike others, I've never had issues with Netgear's customer service.  Little bit on the pricey side, but I would recommend the router to others.",,,
685,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,11,13,20-Dec-09,A2WQJ54BKNSS5V,Great replacement for my old G router,"I purchased this router because it had all of the features I was looking for - Dual Band, Wireless N, USB Storage, and Media Server. If I had written a review a week ago, it wouldn't have been as positive. Everything about the router worked great except for an issue where the unit would lock up if you connected a USB drive that had a lot of media files. This was a known issue by Netgear (it's posted on their website) and the only workaround was to disable the Media Server feature. Since the Media Server functionality was one of my top reasons I purchased the WNDR3700, I was disappointed this did not work. Fortunately Netgear has just released updated firmware on 12/16 and it seems to have resolved the problem.Performance has been great. This router replaced an older Linksys G router and the range on the WNDR3700 is much better. I have several wireless G devices connected on the 2.4 GHz band (Wii, Roku Soundbridge, cell phones, printer, and a few laptops) and have had no problems at all. I have another laptop connected using wireless N on the 5 Ghz band and it connects at 270 or 300 Mbps and maintains a solid connection during use. I have also found the router to work well with VPN on both mine and my wife's laptops.I use Vonage VOIP and have had no problems. Unlike my old Linksys router, I did not need to configure any QOS for the VOIP. As a matter of fact, I was using the phone for quite some time while I was in the process of transferring around 75GB of files to the USB drive attached to the router and did not experience any delays, dropouts, or quality issues with the VOIP.The USB storage and Media Server capabilities are key features for me. Beside needing a Wirelss N router, I also wanted to replace my aging NAS that I use for backups. I'm still in the process of setting up backups for my PCs, but so far the transfer rate seems adequate. It took about 2 or 3 hours to transfer around 75GB of data using SyncToy (Microsoft utility). A few things I picked up on various sites/forums: Netgear notes a known issue with write speeds on NTFS formatted drives so I formatted my new USB drive as EXT3 (this is a common file system used with Linux). If you have slow transfers, do a search for 'Remote Differential Compression'.I often like to stream music to my Roku Soundbridge. Previously I always needed to turn on one of my PC's to serve up my music. The Media Server feature in the WNDR3700 eliminates that need. I haven't used this feature extensively yet, but streaming music to my Roku worked great and was actually quicker at buffering the music and selecting songs.Overall this is a great router and I can easily recommend it. The new firmware resolves the Media Server/USB problem and also adds setup support for Win7 and 64bit OSes (see Netgear site for details).",,,
686,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,1,19-Dec-09,A1Y4VUSM6KL3R6,Netgear Wireless-N Router Outstanding!,"I purchased this for my houses on the Caribbean. The houses are approximately 60 feet apart, the router is in the back house, on the second floor. Signals are still strong on the beach, which is another 40 feet from the front house. Speed is excellent, signals are strong, worked even with my older Mac computer as well as the newer PC. My renters are extremely pleased too!  I would recommend this router especially for anyone upgrading from an older one (my original Lynksys that was about 4 years old.)I give this 5 stars, even if you don't want to work on your Caribbean vacation, you can!",,,
687,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,2,19-Dec-09,A1G716105L4CSA,Great all around,"I live in a plaster walled house which has always had difficulty with WiFi. This router pushes through it with little difficulty and gives good signal strength throughout the house. Previously (802.11b) this required two access points. Features include everything that you would expect in a router like this including a few extras like USB drive sharing. It may be an expensive unit, but it's worth every penny.Note: I'm a computer professional, so my perspective on ease of use may be a bit skewed. However, the router automatically detected that Verizon was using the 192.168 IP range and reconfigured itself to avoid conflicts. I would call that very user friendly. The device practically configures itself.",,,

Nice, clear instructions on the install CD; Also, the color coded cables make it easier too. If we can set-up this thing, almost anyone can (smile).2.  Have only used it for a day, but works great.3.  Very pleased with purchase.  (did not purchase at amazon.com, but may have if it were not out-of-stock at the time).Only complaint is, it is a bit over priced. We feel it should only cost about $99, but what do we know. ;)",,,
691,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,5,6,12-Dec-09,ABQEVTLSWR4XF,Great Product - Love It!!!!,"I researched wireless routers a month ago in preparation for a purchase. Then, in the meantime, my son-in-law's router died so he needed a new one. I told him about this model. He'd never used Netgear in the past but also checked the reviews on Amazon, bought, and immediately started raving about this product. So I bought this month with high confidence.I have to say that the product is even better than I expected. Setup was a breeze at 30 minutes. That's for the router and testing the 7 network devices (mix of wired and wireless) we use in our home. Everything worked like a charm. In that short time we have 3 network signals to use. High speed wireless, lower speed wireless, and a lower speed Guest wireless signal that lets visitors use the connection but not poke around our devices.This is our third Netgear router and it's really a jump forward - good job guys! The last two were also great for their day but I'm glad to give up the blue disco ball on my last Rangemax for this unit. Netgear includes everything you need in the box and even labels items 1 2 3 so you can easily identify what you need at each step. Simple and brilliant. But then aren't the best things usually that way?",,,
692,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,2,11-Dec-09,A3SCC5RQ96X524,"Worked well...  Nothing bad, it just worked","The only minor issue, which was probably more of a user issue, was identifing which 'button' was the add another secure wireless device versus the button to turn off the wireless support.  I couldn't find anything in the minimal documentation explaining which was which.  Thus, I wasted some time sorting things out when I added another wireless bridge to connect the Sony Bravia TV and accidently turned off the wireless connectivity to my 3 laptops instead of adding the new device!",,,
693,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,3,10-Dec-09,A2F8TFDDDB5WFQ,Netgear Rangemax WNDR3700 Dual Band Wireless-N Gigabit Router,"I was using a 5-year-old Linksys Pre-N router whose range was lacking before I purchased this. When using my ipod touch in bed, I would frequently have to hold my arm towards the door to pick up a better signal. Recently, I would lose the connection frequently and have to reset the router numerous times a day. After doing a bit of research, I settled on this Netgear router which arrived at my door last night. I followed the instructions on the website and it was so quick and easy to set up that at first I did not realize I was done! I think the entire process from opening up the box to testing the wireless on another device took about 7 minutes. The range seems really good - strong signals throughout the house (have not tried the basement yet).By the way, I am on comcast cable internet - in response to one of the other reviewer's comments, the modem supplied by the cable co has a reset button - on mine you activate it by inserted a pen. You can also call the cable co and they will reset your box. The cable co told me that you should not unplug the modem to reset.",,,
695,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,4,5,9-Dec-09,A3I6704DLTIILE,a nice upgrade from my previous pre-N mimo wireless router,"My trusty Belkin wireless router never gave out on me, but it was starting to show its age. So far this router is solid. No dropped connections so far. I have 4 computers, 1 media server, and 2 cell phones accessing wireless connection (three 802.11n, three 802.11g, and one 802.11n pre-N draft 1). Setup was a little harder compared to my Belkin router which had better descriptions on what each function does. To Netgear's credit, it had a fully automatic setup option, but unfortunately it did not find the correct settings when I used it. I had some heartache, but after copying my Belkin's setttings, I finally got the Netgear's to work...albeit manually. Once it was running it was a strong performer. My laptop (which can acces either the 2.4ghz or 5.0ghz band) got around 46 Mbps (5.75 MB/s equivalent) on average by downloading a 100mb video file from a powered WD500 external hard drive connected to the router (using ftp local network access) so that I know its not the internet bottleneck (but it may be my laptops wireless card). My other computers got around the same. Connection is pretty good, not much better than my MIMO Belkin router (which had three atennaes). The router is in a different room from all my computers (each of them in separate rooms as well) if that gives any idea of the distance. I can't vouch for the gigabit ethernet connections but thats one of the reasons why i wanted to upgrade (to connect a network-attached-server in the future).Things I liked:-Dual band with independent atennaes (so you can have two wireless networks)-Separate Guest network (so you dont have to give out your password)-QoS and WMM (Wi-Fi multi media) prioritizing traffic-Usage meter-Ftp and http local and remote access to an attached external hd (router acts like a simple NAS device)-Media server-Linux based firmware (not sure) so possibilities for 3rd party customizationThings I didn't like/didnt care for:-The router, Ftp, and http access (currently) uses only 1 password..meaning once someone knows your ftp access they can access your router settings too. So really, it acts like a NAS but no support for multiple users.-Incorrect automatic setup (at least for me)-Basic user interface (but if it works, it works)-Haven't tried the secure push-connect featureOverall, I WOULD recommend this router to a friend. AND i would but it again if i had to.",,,

It handles everything like a champ. My average connection speed from my wireless laptop to my readynas for data transfer is 180-200 Mbps which is very fast. All of them can be running at any given time and I never miss a beat.I did read some other reviews by others, about it not connecting, I am going to tell you that they probably have Cable, and they have not realized that you have to call your cable company to have them reset the modem, if you can see the network but can't connect to the internet, your modem needs to be reset from the cable company.They will try the first step which is to unplug the modem for 10-20 seconds and then plug it back in, then plug in the router, doesn't always work but when I call them and have them send a 'hit' it works with in seconds.",,,

701,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,3,4,29-Nov-09,A1KH2BZ6OUYO6M,Update to Original Review,"When my old trusty Linksys/Cisco WRT54G router reached a point where daily reboots became necessary, I decided to take a look at other options.  It turns out NetGear has come a LONG way with the WNDR3700.Since I don't have a 'vanilla' network, I set it up manually, so I can't comment on the Setup Wizard, however, even manual setup was a breeze.  The administration functions are straight forward, concise, and offer much more than what was available to me on the Linksys.1. Speed.  The obvious upgrade was wireless N.  However, the integrated GB switch ports were also a nice surprise.  The WNDR3700 gives you, essentially, 4 networks. 2.5GHz, 5.0GHz, and two Guest networks at various speeds, which allow you to give isolated access to visiting friends without handing out your security keys (and the 3700 offers all the latest wireless encryption standards -- however, keep in mind, your wireless laptop NIC has to support the same standard and speed).2. Lockout functions.  The administration screens allow you to lock out specific services (i.e. by TCP, UDP, port, and by specific IP addresses.  Additionally, you can schedule time windows for the lockout to occur.  You can also block sites by keyword, or domain, while still allowing your own 'trusted' IP to visit those sites.  One item I would have changed, was to be able to perform the lockout by MAC address as opposed to IP.  MAC addresses don't change, IP's are dynamically (usually) assigned, and change.3. Logs. Big improvement over the Linksys. The logs give you access by access reporting of sites, by which IP, as well as filtered scans, DoS attacks, connects, and disconnects, attempts to access blocked sites, etc.  It leaves little to guess at when doing an analysis of your internet usage and external attempts to access your network.  Additionally, you can have the logs (and attempts) e-mailed to you, if you want.4. QoS.  You can control bandwidth usage and priorities (I had limited capability on the Linksys for this).  In addition, there is a Traffic Meter, which gives you historic usage values.5. USB Storage.  Very flexible ability to plug in any USB drive (or thumb drive), and set shares, access privileges, etc., for local or remote (LAN or WAN) sources.  Extremely simple to use, and it creates a single repository for all of your network users to share files.There are many more functions available, such as backing up, Port Forwarding and Triggering, etc.  A few very advanced functions for those that like to tweak and optimize their networks, as well.I've yet to have any issues with this router, and I'm thoroughly pleased with its performance.  It doesn't seem to generate as much heat as some of the other Linksys/Cisco routers I looked at, and it seems to be very tolerant of exceeding switch hops, cable distances, and other networking no-no's that many of us abuse.  All in all, a very good choice.  Cisco had better keep an eye over their shoulder.REVIEW UPDATE 02-14-2010Whenever I buy a product for which I've read the reviews, I make a mental note of going back to the 1-, and 2-star reviews to see if I've experienced any of the complaint issues.In this case, I've experienced absolutely none of them:1- The Guest networks work EXACTLY as advertised.  They have been a major triumph, since my kids have friends over with their own laptops, and it's now a simple matter to allow them temporary access without handing out WP2 security keys from our main networks.2- Transferring files between computers (I'm a consultant, so I have a number of them), used to be a 1-copy to thumbdrive, 2-move the thumbdrive, 3-copy to system effort, when I wasn't running a private server.  Now, I keep a small (500GB) USB based backup drive attached, and it acts not only as a local repository for sharing files between systems, but I'm able to access files on it (with authentication) remotely from across the country, if need be.  I've yet to have a single issue with it.3- I've never had a single lockup on this router since installation, and it hasn't been down or powered off for a single minute since its installation.4- I've been able to block specific sites, schedule access times to the net (when the kids didn't want to hang up their laptops at 2am), and even set QoS bandwidth priorities so my work isn't interrupted by multiple accesses and downloads by other family members.  Works like a charm.5- I've been able to set port forwarding for specific purposes (IP cam, certain games, etc.) and it's worked exactly as it should.6- It has self-upgraded itself since the purchase, since it automatically checks for new firmware whenever I access the management utility.7- I've even been able to temporarily set up an FTP server, and put it in a DMZ for access from an external client, when I needed to.Bottom line, every function is working flawlessly.  I've watched the Linksys quality (overheating, limited functionality, etc.) decline ever since Cisco bought them out, and couldn't be happier with the NetGear.I can't comment on support, since I've never had a problem requiring me to call them.If I had ANY possible improvement suggestions, I would say to reconfigure the 'Schedule' function in the Management utility, so different times can be applied to different logged-on clients; and make the references to those clients by MAC address instead of IP (IP addresses change in a DCHCP environment).Otherwise, I'd recommend this router to anyone.  It's worth every penny.",,,

723,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,4,6,23-Nov-09,A3MFORLOKIOEQY,Excellent choice for the home network,"This is a very good router with some exceptional features:Pro:- From the documentation I was unable to determine if this thing worked with my older 'B' laptop. All the writing referred to the ultra modern 'N' capabilities. I discovered that it does function with the 'B' protocol, but it works better with 'G' or 'N'.  I achieved the best speeds with the 'G' protocol, but keep in mind that any home internet connection speed will be far less that the wireless network speed. Based on my experience, I would suggest a 'G' protocol as a minimum.- The router supports both 5GHz and 2.4 Ghz speeds. I actually prefer 2.4; it seems to work better in my situation for some reason.- It has a really nifty feature that allow you to connect an external USB hard drive, and then find it with any browser on the network by typing in '\\readyshare\USB_Storage'. It can be password protected for read or write. This is very useful, providing a home networked backup location. I hooked up my USB drive and now use it from any computer. Very well done.- Along the same lines, the router provides the capability to connect to a media server, including automatic scan for new files at regular intervals. This is used to allow a media player to access your media files over wireless. I did not try this feature.- The device sets up easily if you have a 'default' installation. More on this later.- Included security protocols are what one would expect: WEP (not recommended!), WPA-PSK (TKIP and AIE), WPA-PSK [TKIP] + WPA2-PSK [AES], and WPA/WPA2 Enterprise. I'm using WPA2-PSK [AES] and it works fine.- If one is so inclined, the router includes the capability to provide a guest account, perhaps useful in a business situation.- The router supports remote administration, which is really useful.- There is a neat feature that automatically checks for firmware updates when you enter the administration mode. I haven't seen any updates yet, so I can't say how well this works.- It is possible to backup the router settings to your local hard drive, useful in case you need to reset or something.- The router has pretty extensive settings for content filtering, including the capability of blocking sites or services, and the capability to send emails for any filtering events. The filters can be scheduled as to when they are applied.- I did not have a need to modify the other settings, so I will just mention them here: Port forwarding/triggering/QoS support, static routes, UPnP support, and URLs for web support built into the router menus.Performance:Very good. I have excellent signal strength and the throughput is such that I don't really notice that I'm on wireless rather than wired connections.Con:- In my particular situation my internet modem used the same IP address as the default router address. I had run across this before with other routers, so I got past it, but it was not a simple installation. I had to manually set up the router - but I can report that this function works well.Summary: This router is a good choice if you have the need for network storage, media storage, B/G/N compatibility, or all the above. It works very well, but may need some tweaking during installation. Recommended.UPDATE 3 Dec 09:I have just found out that you can access the files on your USB connected drive via the Internet. So this router can be the key to shared storage that can be accessed from anywhere. Very nice.",,,
725,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,5,7,20-Nov-09,A119PGATHKD9FG,Netgear has done well,"I have been on the lookout for a capable consumer-class router for some time. Over the years, I've used and tried a number of different products from D-Link, Linksys and Netgear, so I've gotten a good experience with functionality and reliability of the various brands. Yet, the last few years, I've tended to run into snags with all the various routers. I won't go into details, but suffice to say that I've ended up buying a new router every year.Here are my impressions of this new router.Netgear, the manufacturer of this, the WNDR3700, seem to finally have made a very good and thoroughly engineered home router product. I will compare it to my previous router, a Netgear WNDR3300, which I decided to replace due to instability and random reboots, seemingly under heavy data loads.This Netgear product sports the same online control interface that all Netgear consumer router products has used for years, so if you're familiar with them, you'll be familiar with this.The installation is a breeze. The unit is affixed with stickers that make its physical setup foolproof - the things you need to plug in have stickers with LARGE FRIENDLY NUMBERS IN BRIGHT COLOURS.Out of the box, it is a very nicely designed unit. Netgear has gone with a terrific streamlined look, and abandoned the flashly (no pun intended) battery of blue LEDs on the side of the WNDR3300 (annoying, so i always turned it off; would probably induce epileptic seizures in some people if left on) - the 3700 has exactly the diagnostic and activity LED's you need to see whats it's doing, and nothing more. It's utilitarian and sleek, not over-decorated. Otoh, it avoids the boring sandwich-and-brick look of most D-link routers, and Netgear has wisely also avoided plastering the router with all-blue LED's for the diagnostic lights. All LED's on the 3700 are green during normal operation (amber for errors), with the exception of one, the 5 Ghz WLAN LED, which is blue. I'm happy with this; blue is a nice colour, but EVERY manufacturer of digital equipment thinks so too, so you can hardly get a thing without BRIGHT BLUE LEDs anymore.In operation, I'm likewise very happy with it. My reason for switching from the predecessor (the 3300) was that heavy data traffic semmed to cause heavy packet loss; and when the WLAN interface was active, I would experience as much as 30% packet loss (tested over several hours running pings on several nearby hosts).I've stress tested this with both heavy data traffic, saturating my outbound internet connection, and activity from multiple clients on the wireless bands (both 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz, also simultaneously), and nothing touches it; the packet loss is not noticeable, or in specifics less than 0,1% at all times. (I recall having the same problem with lost data or no availability when the WLAN was heavily active on a D-link DIR-655, which resulted in my replacing that. I'm wondering if this is a general problem for some routers.)Wireless ranges seem somewhat better than the predecessor. I'm able to get somewhat better 802.11-n connectivity than with earlier N-capable routers.The web interface for the router is fairly easy to get the grips with, but is likewise showing its age. It works well, and is fairly easy to comprehend, yet Netgear should give it a makeover - HTML frames are so 90's. :)I have not tried the external USB storage function yet, so I can't say anything about that. I'll try that later.All in all, for the price, this is a gem. The installation, setup and configuration is a breeze. It's functionality is spotless. The gigabit (1000 Mbit/sec) interfaces means that it has enough throughput capability to serve your home / home office  or small office network in regards to collaboration and file sharing for years to come (which is more than can be said for 100 Mbit networking still found in some networking products, which in this day and age feels like a ball and chain around the leg of people who do file sharing regularly).I'll continue to test and poke this router, and I will revise this review and rating, should any problems show up. But for now, I'm overjoyed that the quality I'm familiar with from Netgears Professional products seems to has made it into their consumer segment as well. Well done, Netgear - do keep it up.Update, 27dec, 2009: Has been runnign flawlessly for over a month, under heavy and varied loads. Overjoyed.",,,
726,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,3,19-Nov-09,A2QNS95WGN35G9,We have a go,"This guy easily gets 5 stars.It looks so beautiful and sophisticated in my room.  (Honestly, people always comment on it; the ooooh's and awee's always ensue).I used to work IT (and no, it's not the geek's who oooh and awe, they do that over my cisco rack, but that's another issue altogether!)My previous router was a linksys and while I'm not a big fan of the whole GUI interface, this router makes me appreciate the linksys interface all the more.The interface on this guy is clunky, there's no easy way (heck there may be NO way) to see who all is connected to your network wirelessly (I needed to get an ip address off a device so I could connect and couldn't find it anywhere, even though it was connected (that device being a wireless bridge))The interface is just quite clunky for me.Please do not let that dissuade you by any means (once you get it working (which takes MAYBE 2-3 minutes) you'll likely never venture into the gui again).I love having 802.11n (it's like I'm living in the future!), being able to stream content off my desktop to my laptop in high speed is just so amazing (previously only had 802.11g (stone age, I know).This guy performs almost flawlessly.  I've gotten disconnected a few times with my macbook pro as well as one of my game consoles, but for the most part it is quite consistent.  (I know I got disconnected from my router because I could not access it via the routerlogin.net and needed to unplug and start it back up to get back online).Pros:Looks drop dead gorgeous (honestly, It's like a beautiful futuristic piece of art, the sheer look of it brings an unparalleled joy to my life (might be over doing it here!))Works as you would expect, easy to connect to, future proof, and it supports all the latest technical protocols (also has a guest network access feature, as well as the ability to track how much bandwidth you use).You can hook up a harddrive and stream it to your other computers, as well as to your game consoles (did not try this out myself).It just works, all I did was unplug my old, put in the same info into my new one and I was off in minutes (the longest part of the process was opening the box).Cons:Interface can be clunky at times, ok so I need to click here, watch the middle screen, and then scroll down and click that button, then wait for it to refresh?  Gotcha!Day to day usage with 802.11n will not make much a difference to you (unless you're streaming HD video from laptop to apple tv or something).  (This is NOT a con of this device, just something that needs to be said).Bottomline?  Features almost all the same specs and features as the apple device, works great, looks absolutely awesome (standing vertical) and the lights, ahhh, the lights, they bring such life into an otherwise dull room (filled with blinking red lights and the occasional green light having yellow and blue just makes life...'better'.)If you need (or just want) 802.11n you cannot go wrong by picking this up.  Highly recommended (just don't hide it like you did your old crappy router that looked horrible, this one looks nice, much better than the picture would have you believe).",,,

730,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,3,12-Nov-09,A3W1JXO03JIPWD,Best product in this category by miles,"Win 7 64 bit requires a manual setup of the router, but that was basically painless.  After setting up the access controls to your ISP, just reset your ISP modem and bam you have the internet.  And wow, how fast this thing is can't be overstated.  Connections to Intel 4965agn and 5300 are flawless as well as the USB adapter from Netgear.  Range is significantly better than the 3300 I replaced, resulting in noticeably better speeds than the former at longer ranges.  Talks perfectly to a Motorola Docsis 3.0 modem and IPV6.Given that you can spend MORE money and get less performance, I highly recommend this router at this price point.  If you are deeply concerned with the USB drive connection, check compatibility first.  But as a wireless router this is finally a product that can make N speed a household item.  Router sits in the cellar and goes up 2 floors from there with connections on the upper floor at 80-100mbit in single channel mode.  Extremely good considering the old router could barely manage 1/10th of those speeds.2 weeks into this and not a single reboot.  Firmware update took a couple of minutes and not many at that.  It's very fast internally as well as connection wise.",,,

732,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,3,9-Nov-09,A30UP2KKD5IQEP,What an improvement!,"I switched from a Linksys WRT300N router to try the Netgear Rangemax WNDR3700 Dual Band Wireless-N Gigabit Router (Black). I have been on the 300N for about a year, working wirelessly mainly from a Dell laptop with wireless N. The design of the Netgear is pretty solid. With the antennae built in and not sticking out everywhere, its clean and albeit non-functional, the case and overall design is aesthetically pleasing.Performance: the increase was immediately evident. Before installing I set my laptop up approximately 25 feet from the existing router, with  two partial brick walls between the two. From the Linxsys, I was able to get a fading in and out poor signal. Without moving the laptop I swapped to the Netgear and immediately received a solid very good signal. It was fast and solid and the signal didn't drop once in the hour or so I tested from that location. Just on shear signal strength the dual band is worth it if you have any sort of problems with your existing Wireless N router. Also to note, power setting are available at 3 levels in case you want to go the opposite direction and limit your broadcast range. Obviously, I had them cranked as high as they would go. :)Features: I generally use more than the average setup. I network about 6-8 pc's at any given time in my home. I run a website, FTP and a voice chat server for gaming all from various machines in my network. Everything was set back up and running within a couple minutes. The configuration interface is robust but clean and well organized. The traffic routing features are a definite plus and although haven't set any of them up yet, I was able to look and was impressed with the potential. The router also allows for multiple SSID which is a very nice feature if you have people in and out of your house as I do.Overall, for about a month this has been a solid router and I have had no complaints at all. I'm pretty excited to play with some of the other features I have not had time to play with, but even with the basic to moderate settings, this router is leaps and bounds ahead of my previous N router. It really seems to grasp the concept of the N wireless and shows you what it can do when done properly.",,,
734,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,13,15,30-Oct-09,A2KPZN03H47TRR,"Solid, reliable connections","I replaced my Linksys WRT610N after its failure at a mere 14 months.  As a consequence, I can offer a direct comparison.  I was looking for equivalent or superior features in a unit with greater reliability.  After two weeks of use, I can confirm that the Netgear WNDR3700 meets that requirement.The WNDR3700 offers a solid, fast N connection to several notebooks and wireless nodes using both the 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz frequencies.  Signal strength in my two-story house is 4 bars at 5.0GHz and 5 bars at 2.4GHz at the farthest point from the router on a different floor .  This is higher than that ever provided by the Linksys router.  Throughput rivals that of the direct connection used by my desktop.Installation was simple, with connections swapped between routers.  I was again online after rebooting my cable modem and router, and then using the router utility to configure my wireless and network settings.  I am particularly impressed that the router utility automatically checks for firmware updates and then offers to perform the task.  I followed the prompts and did so upon first use.  This is MUCH easier than checking manually and then going through the convoluted download and installation process required by Linksys.  (I'd performed a hard reset and firmware upgrade in an effort to revive the old router without success; previous firmware upgrades had been successful.)The availability of a secondary guest wireless connection that can be isolated from the remainder of the network is a boon.  I was recently able to provide a separate password to a visiting ISF calibrator so that he could access the Internet without seeing my secured data.  GREAT!  I didn't have to reset my security password on the router and multiple devices; merely changed the guest password for the next potential user.The connection for the USB external HDD is immediately recognized and appears as an available network drive.  I'll soon test the proclaimed ability to remotely access the drive when traveling.The Linksys router required a reboot on a regular bases when it would refuse to authenticate wireless devices using the proper password.  Dropped connections were also a problem.  Thus far, the WNDR3700 connects flawlessly and remains connected.The WNDR3700 is everything I'd hoped for with the Linksys router, and then some.  The fast and solid wireless connection is complemented by an easily-used configuration utility that makes security and wireless settings simple and firmware upgrades exceptionally timely and easy to install.  For home-office use, this router meets and exceeds my needs and expectations.  It is worth every penny!",,,
738,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,3,5,16-Oct-09,ARXRXSEV8P12E,Netgear Rangemax 3700 dual-band is now the standard,"For home or small office networking it doesn't get much better or easier to install. The true dual band allows me to use my laptop in the kitchen even when the microwave oven is on. Quality of VOIP calls are much improved during a simultaneous download or video playback. Range also has increased over previous Netgear wireless g. The 'guest' network feature comes in handy when visitors are in town. In short, it's worth the price.",,,
739,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,4,15-Oct-09,A3N4VTNFPMTHEF,"Prosumer"" router""","I got this router to use in our office network and it totally exceeded my expectations.  The WNDR3700 allows you to create wireless SSIDs on the 5GHz and 2.4GHz bands so everyone can join your LAN.  In addition to the two frequencies, you can even set up a guest network on each frequency that allows guests to get internet access without allowing them access to your LAN.  This is perfect for our office where we have local servers that contain sensitive information.I haven't done any official speed tests, but everything feels snappy and quick on wireless G right now.  I'll be adding some wireless N devices to the network over the next week or two so I will update my review accordingly.It seems that the open source firmware community is working on porting DD-WRT for the WNDR3700, but I haven't had any problem with Netgear's software.  The interface is a little clunky to use because it's bogged down by the wealth of options that this router can provide, but if you're experienced with setting up wireless networks, you shouldn't have any trouble finding your way around.  For people who want a quick and easy solution, the router configuration also provides a wizard that will walk you through the setup.So far, we've been running in it for a few weeks now and it has been perfectly stable.  Setting it up as a wireless access point was easy enough.  I just plugged it into our LAN and configured the wireless to what I wanted.",,,
740,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,5,7,15-Oct-09,A1GWG5CWLKJ7ET,Excellent!,"After testing this out for a few weeks I'm very happy with this product.  I'm a bit biased as I've always used and trusted Netgear, but this shouldn't deter you from getting a VERY high quality product.  Besides the almost non-important fact that it's a very sleek and stylish product, I needed to make sure it could handle my multi-computer, high speed, high security work environment.What I've found:-The signal is sharp, clean, and without interruption.  Speed is excellent (any issues THUS FAR have been found to be with either the website or my ISP, not the router).-Multi user, multi-computer, multi application/component interface, use, and setup/monitoring is very simple.Yes, it's a bit on the expensive side, but this is something I'm planning on keeping for a while, I don't think I'll ever need much more then what's offered here.  If you're someone who uses just a standard computer/ISP, for typical tasks, then there's really no need to get this expensive router.  If you need speed, realibility, and especially for multiple anything, then this is a must.",,,
742,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,6,8,14-Oct-09,A19PXWQ918LAVG,Great Router,"This is the most capable router I have ever used.  In the past I've worked with Netgear, Linksys and DLink equipment.  I tend to prefer Netgear and the WNDR3700 has pretty much cemented that for me.The interface and setup are pretty much the same as any other Netgear router, except there are a few more options.  This is the most feature packed router I've used to date.  I think some may feel that it is over kill, but I think all of it will soon be standard fare in most homes in the near future.  The ability to pretty much instantly create networked storage from any USB device, the ability to stream media to DLNa/UPnP devices, the multiple channels, guest accounts and pure speed are all becoming more necessary as our homes become increasingly connected.  What good is a nice fat pipe coming into your house if things get throttled right after the modem?What I've always liked about Netgear is that the default firmware gives me a lot of functionality that I haven't seen in other devices.  Sure, I can slap dd-wrt on something but that isn't always a stable solution.  My WNDR3700 is rock solid, giving me all the features I want or may want without adding the complexity of trouble shooting third party software.Signal and speed have been great thus far.  Setting up a guest network is easy and a real convenience.  I've had people over before, had to give them the key to connect to my network, and then I have to change it after they leave.  Which means changing my setup on my machines too.  No more.I can imagine some saying this is more than they need.  Maybe so, but I like having options and I'm not a cutting edge guy but already the majority of my entertainment and communication come via the web over multiple devices.  It's nice to have hardware designed to do the lifting necessary, and I don't foresee the need getting lighter in the future.  This would also work well in a small office, though I don't really have any expertise in that area.Bottom line, this is a little more expensive than a very low end router that doesn't support the newer technology and features but you get great value for the extra cost with this unit.  It's not a throw-away unit, it is built to stick around a while and meet the needs of owners for their current and future networking needs.",,,

I'm glad I did.  I didn't have to call customer care, I followed the wizard, and it was fairly easy.  Naming the bandwidth was a new one for me, I named it the same as my password.  Oops, easy to go online, and adjust it there.  plan to read through the manual to understand more of what it can do.From the Belkin my reception increased over 25%.  It is tall, so I ended up laying it on its side.Connection to the device is so easy.

It was also amazingly easy to install and setup using the included utility that provided step-by-step animated instructions. The process was very straight forward and I was able to have the Netgear router up and running in less than 10 minutes, seamlessly replacing my aging Linksys wireless router.We have a lot of networked devices in our shop, including 3 wired PCs, 3 wireless laptops (two 802.11g and one 'N'), a Linksys hub, 2 wired laser printers, and 1 wireless (802.11g) All-In-One printer. In addition we also hold training and workshops that run over several days and our customers often wanted to jump on our wireless network, something which we often allowed by giving them our WEP Key, but unfortunately that also gave them access to our network devices. The WNDT3700 has a lot of advanced features that made significant improvements to my network performance and security, including:+ 4 Gigabit Ethernet Ports - Each port can auto 'downspeed' to as well to support older Ethernet cards.+ Dual Band Wireless - Supports 'legacy' 802.11a,g and the newer 'N' (very fast indeed) with much better range than my Linksys router.+ Support for Wireless Guest Network - Easy to setup and control access, we use this as a courtesy to our customers in our shop when we hold classes and only give them access out to the Internet, protecting our internal network.+ USB Drive Support - Works very well! We now have a networked 2TB RAID drive that is accessible from all of our shop PCs, it was easy to setup using the utility included on the CD that helps you map the drive. We now store all of our critical files and photos on the network drive. No complaints at all on the speed and performance with retrieving even the largest files.+ Broadband Usage Meter - Useful to monitor your traffic volume to\from your ISP, which is important if you push a lot of multimedia files over a provider that has a monthly usage cap (like Comcast). This seems to be fairly accurate from my casual observations.There are a few features that I don't expect to use (QoS, WPS, etc) but all of the functions I configured worked correctly right out of the box, which is perhaps a first for me and a welcome change over previous network device installations.Overall, I am very pleased with the ease of use and performance of this wireless router!

Going through web pages with ease while torrenting 2MB down 1.3MB up. I even played some WOW on the pc and Uncharted 2 demo(PS3) while this was going on, and everything was super responsive.Played a few H.264 movies on the PS3, and was able to raise output resolution on the media server to 1080 with no flickering/stuttering at all. Of course with more than 1k different torrent connections going on at the same time.It looks cool. LED's are kinda bright, but not to bad. I wasn't able to use the disk provided with it to set it up since I'm running a 64 bit OS (win 7). However, their is a built in setup wizard in the router config page that just did it automatically. Which is super easy to use, and instantly downloaded the new firmware.Their is no dd-wrt available at the moment dedicated to it, but a quick stop at thier forums showed users who have used wndr3500 versions on it.UPnP does seem a little off since I had to manually set some port forwarding with Quake 3 and torrent software, but after a little research this does seem to be pretty common with all of Netgear stuff.The wireless is unbelivable.

Needed a replacement with more speed and processing power to handle multi-media, large LAN file transfers and N wireless services.Tried the D-Link DIR-825, but undocumented MAC address restrictions killed the deal.  The router would not accept a non-zero value for the first two characters of the WAN MAC address.Looked at the Linksys WRT-610N, but was concerned with past Linksys product performance.Purchased the Netgear WNDR3700 which was getting very good reviews and selling out quickly after release.Configuration was a breeze with typical Netgear menus.  LAN and WiFI speed are excellent.The DLNA USB device option works great, streaming pictures to our LAN connected Samsung TV.Guest WiFi access with LAN restrictions makes sharing with guests or visiting family easy.There have been no issues using Vonage VoIP and transferring large amounts of data at the same time.  QOS settings are available in the WNDR3700, but I'm not currently using it.  Even with QOS and rules active, the DGL-4300 would sometimes cause the VoIP to stutter during large transfers.Port Address Translation (PAT) is not available.  This makes it difficult to access multiple Port 80 LAN devices from the WAN side.I rate the unit 4.5+ stars.  PAT would have made it a five.",,,

759,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,830,865,24-Sep-09,A11XT24G3PZ8CQ,"NETGEAR RANGEMAX WNDR3700 - Fast, easy-to-use and rock solid","This router is fast, easy to set-up and smartly engineered.  Although this is a high-end feature-rich consumer router, out of the box, I had this running in just a few minutes.  Using the simple color-coded 1-2-3 step setup process, an expert, or a novice, can have this router up and running very quickly.Modifying the two dual band networks for different names and passwords is straight forward, and I preferred to do it manually. After logging into the firmware, the screens are divided into three panels.  The left panel is the list of the feature sets, such as 'wireless settings,' or 'guest network' settings; the middle panel has the pick list of options for the feature set; and the right panel on the screen explains, in the easiest of terms, what the features and options mean.  There is little need to refer to the product manual or other help.  Everything is in one place, and in the right place.I attained maximum speeds with each of the dual bands when my laptops were in close proximity to the router.  My throughput on the 5 Ghertz band using the 'n' protocol was a blazing 300 Mbps.  With my previous router, I was never able to achieve anything faster than 130 Mbps.  As is the case with the 5 Ghertz channel, this speed drops off quickly as I moved my laptop away from the router.  By 30 feet, I was down to 100 Mbps a second, but still relatively fast when compared to the legacy 'g' speeds.  On the 2.4 Ghertz band, using the 'g' protocol, I saw very little degradation within 50 feet of the router.I streamed a Netflix movie to an HD television flawlessly through a Toshiba laptop and an HDMI cable.  There was no stutter in the picture, and the picture quality was excellent.  Unlike past video streaming, I did not experience a dropped picture while waiting for the video buffer to reload.I connected a USB disk drive to the router and shared it among three laptops without incident.  I established read and read/write passwords for various file folders on the disk drive.  I also made the drive available for access through the Internet, and again this process was straightforward in creating.  I plan on backing up the three laptops to the USB drive on the router, as well as sharing photos and other files with family and friends by having them access the password protected IP address of my new network-based disk drive.In total, you can establish four networks on this router.  One for each of the dual bands, and two more as guest networks for each of the dual bands as well.  The guest networks are nice as they can completely isolate guests from accessing sensitive information on other PCs or devices on the network.  (Or you can open up the guest networks to everything on the network.)Some other features worth noting are the automatic checking for firmware updates every time you log into the router; the 'traffic meter' that shows daily, weekly and monthly internet usage that can be configured to throttle it; and the ability to backup personalized firmware settings in case of an emergency restore.  With regard to the latter, it would be nice to also get a saved PDF file of what the settings are for each of the backed-up firmware configurations.The Netgear WNDR3700 replaced two Linksys routers that I had connected together to essentially create a 'dual band' environment.  One was an older 'g' unit, while the other was a newer 'n' router.  Together they got the job done in a mixed environment of video and Internet surfing.  But the WNDR3700 takes routing to a newer level, with faster processors driving the dual bands to faster speeds and better range; and a big feature set that is easy to use, understand and configure. SIX-MONTH UPDATE - This router has been powered up constantly for six months now, and it continues to run flawlessly.  During this time, two firmware updates have been automatically flagged and applied without incident. I use many of the key features of this router across the three laptops that are connected wirelessly to the dual bands.  Video streaming from Netflix and other Internet sites continues to work smoothly.Being able to connect a USB disk drive to the router has become a heavily-used feature.  The router-based disk drive is the central location for backing up the data from the three laptops.  I can backup these laptops locally, or from anywhere using the Internet.  When traveling with a camera and a laptop, I am able to easily backup digital pictures to the router's USB disk drive.  It is another way to save and protect files when away.This router is my third, and best to date.",,,

Ordered it with the WNDA3100 wireless adapter, which had many problems, thus it was returned.Locally bought the WNDA3100v2 which worked great with the WNDR3700 and has much better range.  Its chipset is from a different manufacturer so it should have been called the WNDA3700.  Unfortunately V1 and v2 have the same model number so you need to look at the picture on the box.  WNDA3100v2 has a light and a button.",,,

This router plus a Netgear Ethernet splitter is now allowing us to watch Netflix w/o any interruptions. We used a wired connection to our TV as I was tired of non stop problems with the wireless setup as our Router is in the basement w/computer & the TV is on the 1st floor. I know it's possible to do wireless connection by putting the router on a high shelf in the basement, but we had so much trouble with getting the 3400 to work wireless or wired that I decided to upgrade the router, add the Splitter & designate the Fastest(High Priority) port to the TV. Our iPad is still wireless which had almost always worked with the 3400 & always w/the 3700. I used wired to get the fastest & most reliable connection to the TV,TiVo & computer. We were sick & tired of fighting the wireless setup & having the reset everything prior to watching every episode of a certain series. We fought with Netflix, contacted Our TV manufacturer & our ISP provider to solve the issue. This combination has solved our problem. We found Cat-7 cables cheap on Amazon & all is working Great!

1026,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,14-Sep-13,AJBC1V499LYA4,Make sure you get the V4,"As of now, you can pretty much ignore the negative reviews involving the connections dropping. That's an old firmware issue that was resolved long ago.The new V4 version of this router has significant all-around performance improvements, so closely rivaling the high end models that cost more than double the amount that it seems pointless to pay more unless you really, really need a more robust wireless N setup than this standard 300+300 dual band router provides. For myself, I have wired gigabit for my most important connections, so that's not an issue for me.Three things I wanted from a new router, after my trusty old WRT54G finally bit the dust after 8 years (wifi had been overclocked all that time... it finally burned out):1) DD-WRT compatibility2) Gigabit switch3) Decent enough dual-band wifiDD-WRT support came earlier this year for the V4. If you use this firmware, you already know... first on the agenda is verifying support and yes, you have it here. For #2, obviously I want gigabit ports since I'm set up for it, and this lets me avoid using an additional, separate gigabit switch like I had to use with my WRT54G. As for the wireless... as stated, this now industry standard dual band capability is more than enough for me. I don't even have the 5ghz radio enabled at this point since I'm not even using anything that supports it. I just need my phone, PS Vita (which supports N on 2.4ghz), and occasionally a laptop on wireless. Very light use overall so 'Decent enough' is enough.DD-WRT installed smoothly and I'm up and running with all my tweaks back in place like remote access and the ability to send a wake-on-LAN packet over the internet to wake my system (something that so many stock router firmwares can't support).All in all it's the perfect upgrade for me. Everything I need under a hundred bucks and it is pretty much as powerful and fast as anything considered higher-end... but I stress again, make sure you get a V4! If you can't be certain you are getting the V4 here, pick it up B&M somewhere because you can verify the version on a red label on the box.",,,

I replaced my old one with this and there are so many benefits with this router.I live in a 3 story house with 5 other people and placing this router in the center of the house makes the range so long. We used to carry a wireless repeater for those who lived in the third floor, but now this router reaches to far we don't really use it anymore.

I called the Belkin technician and he told me that the firmware of my router had been updated, and that I needed to pay for a 6-month or 1 year technical support subscription (between 70 and 160 dollars) and that he would update my router and assist me with all my computer problems during the subscription length. This response really made me angry and I told him that I preferred to buy a brand new router, but it would not be a Belkin this time. I checked out the available routers and I picked NETGEAR. Before I bought it, I asked the NETGEAT support team which model would best fit my needs (a have one laptop, an android phone and a wireless HP printer). The support team suggested I buy the N600 Dual Band WNDR3700. This was an excellent recommendation. The router arrived quickly, was installed in just a few minutes, without flaw.

This router has functioned flawlessly since I first set it up. The setup for the device is an absolute breeze and if you have any previous router knowledge you could most likely do this blind folded. The performance of this router is superior to my old one in many ways, and the routers interface and settings are easily accessible, clearly laid out, and very informative!I took this router a little bit further past standard home use and have it connected to the old Linksys WRT150N with a long Cat5 running through the attic to the other end of the house. This has greatly expanded our wireless ranges by bridging this router with the other. This setup was not as simple as just setting up the router, but all in all it was not that complicated.I highly recommend this router to anyone who heavily uses their broadband internet as that will squeeze the most performance out of this device.

I haven't been disappointed so far.  First, for the price, I have to say I was a bit skeptical.  I didn't really expect it to live up to the reviews given it was so much more inexpensive than other routers in its class.  Out of the box, the setup took maybe 15 minutes from start to finish.  The instructions were clear, with great color images to to reference.  The user interface to set or change your password for the wireless networks is very easy to use.  I have actually gone in multiple times since the original installation to change the password when I determine that my kids have had a bit too much online time - much to their dismay.  I work from home, so in addition to ease of use, I need something that is reliable and easy to troubleshoot.  I haven't had any issues with this router and my wireless network sings.  Very happy customer.",,,

1423,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,5-May-13,AY4GGDLRPK4CP,Fixed all my home network issues,"We're subscribers to Comcast. I've got a fairly complex network layout in my house. I was using Cisco ( Linksys) products previously for years. With my wife now working from home (telecommuting) it's critical that the home network be up 100% of the time. I was using a first gen wireless N router from Linksys and we were experiencing significant downtime with the network. This caused her many hours of frustration (and me many hours of troubleshooting) with her company's tech support. I had Comcast come out and they analyzed out signal coming into the house and everything looked good. The Comcast tech was super knowledgeable and after hearing me explain how I've got the network configured recommended this router from Netgear, he said he used the same one at home. That's not their official recommendation, it was just his personal one.I ordered this from Amazon the day he was here, it was delivered in two days, I plugged it in, configured the router using the routers web page and it's been seamlessly working ever since. I can now forget about coming home and scanning through the router logs looking for red herrings as to why my wife was having connectivity issues that day. She'd call me at work 1-2 times each day saying the network was down. It was becoming a real bother.This Netgear wireless router has been working great since I've hooked it up. I would have to say that we &#34;push&#34; the router with all the devices we have connected to it. We can have up to twenty devices in the house connecting to it either wirelessly or plain 'ol cat5. My wife might be streaming Netflix on her tablet while I'm downloading some gargantuan installer from MSDN and the network never hiccups.I have a 4TB external USB drive hooked up to the USB port that allows me to backup our machines through the router. That frees up a port on my main machine for more toys.***Pros***: Simple easy to read/interpret user interface, dual band, guest network, USBReadyShare, Gigabit ethernetThe network interface (webpage) for the router that Netgear has designed is simple, intuitive, and gives you a quick snapshot of your setup on the 'Basic' tab. You can then drill down into menu items on the left column to get more detailed information about 'wireless', 'parental controls', 'internet', etc.For the more adventurous there is the 'Advanced' tab which allows you to go deeper into the router's functionality, 'security', 'administration,'wireless setup', etc.***Cons:*** I have yet to have an issue with this router.

1441,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,28-Apr-13,ANQ2VKPIZKUBD,Excellent Router,"Just bought this router yesterday at staples for $99.99. It was a pretty good deal. I cant talk to much about the long term durability for i have only owned it for a day. I previously had the netgear n300 wnr2000 and it lasted for about 2 years but then it got a virus on it and i couldn't use it( it was my fault for not setting up better protection on it) When that broke down I bought the belkin n300 router for a replacement and boy did that backfire on me. The range on it was great but it was extremely slow for gaming, surfing the web, watching youtube videos, and just being on my mobile devices. I had that router for about 2 months before I finally decided which router to buy. I chose this particular router because 1. I am a big fan of netgear 2. The gigabit connection is what i wanted and needed for my pc gaming. 3. I have alot of devices that need connecting to the internet ( 3 pcs, 5 smartphones , 2 ipads, 1 ipod,2 laptops, 1 ps3, 1 xbox360 and a smart tv.) So the dual band capability is really useful for when i game on my pc and my kids are on their gaming consoles. When I finally bought the router it took 10 minutes to setup the router and get all my devices connected to the internet so i was happy that it was very quick to setup. The range is great considering i live in a 3 story house and i get great connection everywhere i go in the house. I might have to buy an wifi extender though as my daughter gets bad connection in her room at the top of the house but if you are living in a 2 story House this has amazing strength and range. I will review again after i have owned this product for a longer amount of time. If you are planning on buying a router for your home this is the perfect choice.",,,

1499,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,2,15-Apr-13,ABSRDB25YZY8K,Surprised to find it the most rock-solid router I've ever had,"I'd been a Linksys guy back in high school and college, but recently have been disappointed with the downhill their consumer products have been traveling. I gave this Netgear a chance back in December 2010 and I'm pleasantly surprised to find that it's the most stable router I've ever used.For the first few months of ownership, I would update the firmware religiously, hoping that IPv6 support and support for using the USB port as a printer share would be added. The former was given, the latter never was (buy the next version up, they said!) I'd call that a con, but I knew what I was getting into when I bought it so although I wish they could have added that in firmware, I won't have them lose a star for that.The uptime: I have had the device running, at its longest, for a solid year without a restart. I run a network speed tool/gadget on Windows 7 and note that my ISP always gives me 100% of what I'm paying for (I'm lucky in that regard) and my intranet speeds never vary either - they're always what I expect them be.The device has never frozen on me or needed to be rebooted, even. When I say a solid year, I mean I turn it off generally once a year for two weeks when I go on vacation, along with my cable modem. When I get back home, I turn them on again and they're up and running within 3-4 minutes.I don't know if I'm just lucky, but after rebooting my WRT54G every week or so, this has been a breath of fresh air. I definitely will buy a Netgear (with printer sharing!) again after the experience I've had with this one, I hope its successors will be as dependable.(note: I don't use 'readyshare' or flash drives with it; I've heard it's terrible but I have a NAS I use for media files, so it's not important to me. Your mileage may vary)",,,

The only extra step I had to take was to call netgear (support is free for a certain amount of time) and make sure it was setup correctly with my ISP.Over 6 months later:A little over six months later (10 months) and this router is still functioning at great speeds. I definitely would recommend this router. I use it for my internet and have never had an issue no matter what speed. I have not had any wifi issues either. The router comes with plenty of options for functionality and customization. I am using this instead of the router I got with my ISP and I notice a big increase on speeds.

Between the internet telephone we use dropping our calls to our son's computer throwing him off World of Warcrafts, it was time for a new one.  We started shopping around and were quickly introduced to the Netgear N600 Wireless Dual Band  Gigabit Router.  We did our research and the we shopped around and found the price to be about standard everywhere, so we picked one up.  We have been happy with the choose we made and the dual band has helped a lot. There is a button to shut down the wireless, but anything plugged into the LAN ports still has internet, yes our sons laptop is hooked up to the wireless, so we can shut him down if necessary. :)  The setup  was extremely easy to do and there is no software that needs to be installed from a disc.  There is a web interface to allow you to customize the setting to suit you particular needs.  We were quoted $100 to have it setup from store, but that would have been a waste of $100.  We did post a video to Youtube showing the unboxing and the setup if you are interested in seeing what it looks like up close and how to set it up.  Our Youtube channel is 'WeRmudfun', just look for the 'Netgear N600 Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router WNDR3700v4...Unboxing and Setup' video.",,,
1528,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,7-Apr-13,A2NOIWPJDD7WIQ,The range is as good as advertised,"After buying this router, I don't think I'll ever buy another Linksys/Cisco router again.  I figured that Cisco was a very prestigious company that made quality routers.  However, with all the bells and whistles that some quality routers I bought from Linksys/Cisco had, there was always one drawback: WiFi Range and Strength. I was skeptical about buying Netgear. It was either this or D-Link and I didn't want to go down the Belkin route. So I bought this nice router and it's been a lifesaver. With some Linksys routers (such as the E1200 and E2700), I would get fantastic WiFI throughput, but gosh, the second I walked a few feet away from the router, I would lose Wifi strength immediately.  With the WNDR3700, I managed to get decent WiFi speed as far as 50ft (direct ethernet is always fastest, and yes, the farther I walked away from the router, the slower speed I got. I dunno about getting signal at 300+ feet (as the box states), but I sure get a nice decent WiFi signal and strength at farther distances.  I have my main computer connected via Ethernet and I'm running fast on that already. I think that the word 'dual band' throws people off into thinking that this is a really good thing. Well, yes and no.  For one, I don't have many devices that can run on the 5ghz frequency. Heck, my trusty Nexus 7 tablet, my Roku 2, etc. only run on 2.4ghz. So if you have printers or a network that thrives of benefitting on the 5ghz channel, by all means, go for it. Otherwise, the 2.4ghz WiFi on this router is very strong in my experience. Definitely worth the $99.99 I paid for. The price dropped. Also, keep in mind that there were 4 versions of this router that got release. I got v3, which is decent. Otherwise, there are firmware updates you can obtain from Netgear's site. All in all, a great router.",,,

1644,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,2,17-Mar-13,A2P0N9VQK6EXPS,Simply The Best Performing Router for Many,"Owning this system solved several problems I found resulting from my poor selection of another brand router. I was most impressed with the simultaneous dual band 5GHz and 2.4GHz bands. I had complained to my Internet provider about loss of continuous play while trying to watch even a YouTube video. This system solved that problem with providing the 5GHz band for the WiFi feature that connects to my large screen viewing system. Even more important, the new H-P h9 1100z computer responds with inbound speeds almost three times the old router I had. The 2.4GHz has not been noticeably deficient in connecting to the WiFi of a Sony laptop. Actually this was purchased for a friend, myself having already been enjoying my own router for several months.

1799,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,31-Jan-13,AFR2BJJ32Z3VU,WNDR3700-V4 is the best one yet!!,"UPDATE:We moved to a bigger house (2.5x more sq foot) and the signal was still good on the first floor. On the second floor, the 5G was non-existent and the 2.4 was weak. Decided to play around with some more hardware. At first decided to switch out entire router and bought the new netgear AC router R6250. Folks that router's range was even worse and i decided to stick with the wndr3700. i did buy an extender and am using that now.I initially had the v1 which gave me a lot of problems as the wifi 2.4 connection dropped and I realized that this was a standard issue. I loved the V1 for it's long range wifi antenna and connectivity reliance.Since I liked the features of this router (multiple SSID, guest network, e.t.c.), I opted to buy another version of this product. I got the V3 and that's where more problems started.The V3 had a different antenna provider from V1 and therefore signal strength was weak and choppy at times. Add to that the fact that the V3 dropped WIFI all the time. The router had to be rebooted every other day. Thankfully it was still under warranty and I had amazon switch it out.They sent me a V4 which was a god-send. Not only did it have the same antenna as the V1 (greater signal strength), the setup procedure was a breeze with GENIE. Additionally, GENIE transformed my panasonic wireless multifunction unit into an AIRPRINT printer so I could print from iphone and mac (mac drivers not available for this unit so I couldnt print from mac at all - but GENIE fixed that!).No connection drops and everything works seamlessly. Have had unit for 2 months now.",,,

I am now streaming at over 13 MPS as opposed to less than 3 on Netflix which is very noticeable in loading and picture quality. I have all but eliminated any buffering while streaming on my computer.

The dual band wifi is a great feature, but the dual band belkin usb adapters always default to the 2.4 ghz wireless and not 5.8.  If you are in 2.4 wireless spectrum, and your network adapter is a single band frequency you should be fine.  My laptop can see the 5.8ghz wireless but defaults to 2.4. My Belkin WIreless N 2.4ghz adapter works super fine.  I had to return my dual band adapters still sticking with my older usb adapters.Overall performance its rock solid, only had to restart after the firmware update or when i modify something.  I have yet to restart because it crapped out.  The options GUI is a little more different than DLINK routers.  But you get the hang of it after a few mins.",,,

Plenty of trivially exploitable vulnerabilities that will give you the admin password, WPA key, and even pop a remote root shell. Plus, it's vulnerable to Reaver.  Ideal fodder for a DEF CON talk.

2386,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,14-Jul-12,AQZSWZTO2368E,I LIKE IT!!,"I tried to cheap it and originally purchased a TRENDnet TEW-731BR - that was a mistake - not that it did not (at all) work, it just worked very poorly.  The router is a replacement/upgrade from my old (and still working) Netgear Wireless-G router.  Setup was simple, for more advanced setup - it's all there.  I love the USB attached storage and built in DLNA server - DLNA access is the primary reason I upgraded to a wireless-N router and this one has it built in.  Access in my house is a mix-match of wireless-G, wireless-N 2.4GHz and wireless-N 5GHz and everyting works smooth.  Basically 4 times the cost of the TRENDnet, but you get what you pay for, and on the flip side of that - you pay for what you get. ...know what I mean?  I'm satisfied, it gave me no headaches.  No complaints, but one point:  They don't list a specification on the maximum storage capacity the USB port can handle.  It is 2TB per Netgear technical support.  Worth the money.",,,
2387,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,12-Jul-12,A21GNL0UCLB2SI,So far so good,"I just got this router and it seems to work without any problems. This router has noticibly faster wireless than my old router and the gigabit feature is nice because therefore in works in conjunction with my Netgear GS108 (8 Port gigabit switch witch I will also be doing a review on). Since I just got it, I don't have much to say but I will be updating this soon.!!UPDATE!!This router has been excellent. It has many features and connects all of our wireless and wired devices day after day with no problems. I love the external hard drive feature, I use it a lot and it is awesome. Great way to toss up something and then access it from any computer on your network. Sadly, I have had to restart the router a few times, but overall not many times at all and the router goes day after day with out any problems. Not lets talk coverage, all routers say that they have 'Amazing range'... but it really really depends on your house and what is blocking the router's signal. For example in my house the router's signal is blocked by a large brick wall, therefore some of the far rooms in the house are not covered. However overall the router has good range for most houses.You really can not go wrong with Netgear. I used to have a Linksys router by Cisco and I had to reboot the router often. Other then that, the router had goos range but still I like the Netgear router better. It has awesome features, good range, and works great.I will post another update later.UPDATE: DECEMBER 10, 2013Still doing great! I had to re-boot it couple of times, maybe about once a month, which considering for a router with these features and all the stress i put it under, that's pretty good.",,,

I was not dissapointed when I got it and set it up.The setup is very simple and I had the internet up within 1 minute of hooking it up. And I had configured the wireless network, including a Guest account, configured within another 5 minutes.I immediately went to [...] to check the speeds and I have a 7Mbps increase in download speed(Went from 10Mbps to 17Mbps), I had a D-link before. The upload speeds stayed the same, right around 4Mbps. The wired computers and the Wi-fi phones/tablets all run the same speeds.I keep the router on the floor under my desk and I can still go outside or upstairs or anywhere around the house and still get full reception (all the bars).  I have been as far as 100yrds from the router and still get an excellent signal.If you are looking for a perfect home router, this is it.",,,

With the dual band signal from this router it's not a problem. Easy to set up plug and play practically easy to setup you're own network and encrypt it. Great set up for a good size house with wifi hungry devices like phones, laptops, video game consoles, and TVs. not to mention the price was well below all other sites I found this on.",,,
2460,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,12-Jun-12,A1MVTXOZOM5AYE,Great router for a normal home user,"Just set it up last night. The set up is pretty easy. If you are average with computers/electronics, you should not have a hard time setting this up. I like that you can have different names for each band (2.4/5) and different passwords + a guest network on either of those bands as well. My house is not very big but it reaches all 3 levels and makes it around a big brick chimney as well. I was hoping the 5mhz band would reach my bedroom well so I could use it with my ipad and it does perfectly fine. My old linksys (just a 2.4 G) did not reach my whole house well. I am very satisfied...so far.",,,

The Netgear was very easy to set up and the user interface is logically structured. A few of the options in the advanced settings area are not well defined in the manual, but google is your friend and will come in handy if you're unfamiliar with the settings.Overall I'm very satisfied with the 3700. With the same internet service, It's definitely faster than the older Linksys (to be expected) - you'll especially notice the wireless speed and reliability improvements.  After over a month of use I haven't experienced any problems either.At $99 I can easily recommend this router.",,,

2577,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,25-Apr-12,A710LV6FL7FAC,Best Router I have had,"I have owned about 8 wireless routers. Most were Netgear which so far is my favorite.A storm took out my last N.G. so i thought that since it was a few years old i would try something different.I bought a Cisco-Linksys WRT54GL mainly because of the reviews and amount of people who bought it.All i can say is what a hunk of junk that Cisco-Linksys WRT54GL router is!It so limited on features its sick, things like that should not be even allowed to be sold. What shocks me the most is the high feedback on it.All i can say to that is, most of those people either have never tried a Netgear router, or have no clue what a router should be able to do as far as controls to the user.OK, enough of that, and onto this router. Like i said this is the best one by far i have owned. It chucked full of features and is ultra user friendly.Unlike many other routers i have tried to date, this one is able to know if there is a firmware update on it own, without me having to go to the manuf. site and look for it, then download and install it. When i first started it up, I nailed my WAN connection setup in seconds where it was a fight with the Cisco. after it got the connection it told me there was a firmware update and would i like to apply it. Setting up the rest of the network was a breeze and adding other controls like QOS was a snap. I like QOS because with kids in the house on XBOX, tables and so on i want to make sure 'I' have the highest priority bandwidth and leave them the leftovers ;)There are just to many features on this router to get into that it has over the Cisco, I assure you that if you get this router you will be hooked on N.G.",,,

I immediately got much, much better wireless speed than I had before.  The 2.4ghz band had me connecting with my PC at 140 mbps, and the 5ghz band at 300!

2582,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,18-Apr-12,A1T3M4IGWY9ZV9,Excellent Router,"I needed to replace an aging DLink router.  As I started looking for a new router I had a list of 'things' I wanted. The new router must have Gigabit capability, must have dual bands and must be affordable.  To me, affordable was $100 dollars or less.  So, this router met 2 out of 3 on my list.  I modified my third point on my list to $115.  I could not find another router that could meet all 3 requirements so I purchased the WNDR3700.  I consider myself to be pretty knowledgeable about home networks (This will be the fifth router I have used in the last 15 years and I have had at least 2 computers networked at my house for the last 18.  I currently have a home network of 5 desktops, 4 laptops, 2 smart phones, a Wii, a BluRay player and 2 printers.) so I skipped the 'wizard' set up.  I am happy to say that my 'network' was down for less than 15 minutes!!  The web interface for administering the router is nicely done and extremely easy to use.  I had a little issue with IP reservation for specific computers (my server) and printers, but quickly realized I needed to just restart the router for the changes to take affect (yes, I know, I even said DUH when I did it!!)So, I have no reservations about recommending this router to anyone who is looking at replacing or merely upgrading a router.",,,

2704,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,26-Feb-12,AWMC4NK3B659Z,Custom firmware? Watch out.,"The WNDR3700 is currently the hacker's darling for routers. Dual-band, hella tons of RAM, fast processor, and all but arbitrary to install OpenWRT or DD-WRT onto. Watch out, however, as Netgear has implemented a 'V3' model, which has a completely different processor and has not been updated for DD-WRT or OpenWRT yet.That said, my unit arrived as a V2 model, which meant that I had it up and running custom firmware (DD-WRT for me) in under 5 minutes. Once I was done with that, I had it set to my requirements (no DHCP, seamless wi-fi roaming on G/N 2.4ghz, separate 5ghz network) in under another five minutes. It's been working brilliantly since then, with none of the drop-outs warned about in its DD-WRT wiki entry.Plus it looks smexy. VERY happy with this router, probably more than any other hackable router I've ever purchased.",,,
2722,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,12-Feb-12,A3F0HT2YG3X6CD,Great router easy setup and performs great,"I bought this router to upgrade my old Netgear router. This router performs much faster than the previous model which I had purchased 7 years ago. I recently upgraded my internet speed to 25 mbs through Comcast. I tested my modem and then the router and this router provides the exact same speed quality. The movies through Internet stream seamlessly. I am not a techie guy so I have not used the other features some folks seem to be complaining about. I only use it for regular wi-fi performance and it works great. I tested it on my Samsung LED TV (UND55 7000) and on my Sony Blu ray player BDP-BX2 and they all work great (my router is close to these units within the same room).The setup was easy and pain free. The only step I got stuck for a moment was the security method. Netgear reference guide says 'NETGEAR recommends WPA-PSK (TKP)+WPA2-PSK (AES)' however the setup screen would not let me select this security method and it directed me to select another security method. It's not a big deal to me so I selected another security method.Overall, I would recommend this product but if you wish to use it for other extra features, you may want to read other reviews.",,,

Power down the Comcast modem, power up and run setup on the Netgear install disk.  Follow the setup steps; turn on WPA2 security; turn off SSID broadcast; upgrade the firmware (what a constant challenge on Linksys) and I'm up and running in 30 minutes!  Speed test-WOW!  After running speed tests om my IPAD BEFORE the N600 I saw anywhere from 5 Mbps to occasionally 8 Mbps with Comcast and 802.11G, NOW seeing a consistent 17 to 19 Mbps download!  No issues with Comcast VOIP.This box is awesome!  Entire house up and running is another 15 minutes!  Signal strength is awesome throughout my 2 story house.  Apple TV downloads and iPad videos are now lightning fast!  Thank you Netgear!One month with the Netgear N600 and still amazed at the speed!  Zero issues.  Just ran another speed test from my IPad--17 Mbps download and 5.5 upload!  What an amazing performance improvement over wireless G.  (Ran a speed test on my 3 yr old HP laptop and only saw 10mbps--darn!  It can only run 802.11G.  Old school technology.  Time to upgrade.).  802.11N is the only way to go if you are streaming video from the Internet.But the real benefit of the Netgeat was ease of setup, usage and range.  No issues in my 2 story stick built house with the router on the second floor in the corner of the room.

I haven't had to restart it often, which is rare for me as I have over 20 devices on my network. I have 10 wired devices on it including an xbox, tv, and media streamer. It works flawlessly on the wired side, and LAN speeds are fantastic. The wireless radios took some tinkering (which I expected) but are super reliable as well. I really enjoy working with networking gear, and this is the best router I have used to date for my requirments. The N900 and Cisco E4200 look great also, but I don't have any wireless clients that could take advantage of it. For now, the WNDR3700 V2 is definately my router of choice.",,,
2756,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,4-Feb-12,ARBSGT2NIVQ04,"Excellent, dependable router; Set it up and forget it","I purchased this router 8 months ago to replace a 7-year old Belkin 54G wireless router, which had performed beautifully.  The only reason for the replacement was for the updated speeds.  I was a bit nervous about replacing a perfectly working router with an unknown since my husband often works from home and MUST have a dependable, high speed connection with no breaks in service as his ability to work depends entirely on a connection to his office computer system.  But, after 8 months, I can honestly say that this router has NEVER dropped a connection, and I highly recommend it (my desktop PC uses a wired connection, but all other devices are wireless).  Setup was very easy and it's nice to have options to create multiple networks (two in each band).  For example, my husband's work computer is on a separate 'guest' network from our home devices.  Certainly the speeds are faster than on the 54G router, and the wireless network has better range across my home as determined by my netbook, which is typically used to watch TV via Slingbox on the opposite side of the house, as far from the router as possible.  Without changing the wireless adapter on the netbook (which is the old wireless-G), the connection strength is higher than with the old router.

There support wanted to charge me $39 to fix it, but I found thisI am going to have to get a new tshirt. Thinkgeek has one that says 'I void warranties'. I need a shirt that says 'I brick wireless routers'.Until a few minutes ago I had a bricked Netgear WNDR3700 wireless router. I also have a bricked Linksys router, I'll try to restore it next and post instructions if I have success restoring it too.I have tried the tftp restore instructions on both routers with no success. The netgear was in a continuous reboot cycle and the put command just timed out. I was able to use the Netgear firmware restore utility to restore the firmware eventually. Here are the steps:1. Get the Netgear installation CD. If you're like me and can't find it, download the Windows 7 version from the Netgear website at [...]. Extract it on a Windows 7 machine (I used a virtual machine on my Mac in VMware Fusion). Set up a static ip address on your physical network port on the 192.168.1.0/24 network, plug a network cable into your workstation port and then in port 1 of the router. It helps to turn off your wireless on your workstation while you do this or you can have trouble only talking on the network cable.2. Do the 30-30-30 hard restart on your router. Make sure your router is plugged in to power and connected to your workstation. Use a straightened paperclip and press and hold the reset button for 30 seconds on the router. Still pressing the reset button, pull out the power cord from the router. Hold the reset button for another 30 seconds and then plug the router back in while still holding the reset button and hold the reset button for another 30 seconds while the power is restored.3. Now you should see 2 green lights on the router. There will be a steady green light on the port you're plugged into and a slowly blinking green light about it. This means it has corrupt firmware but it's waiting and available for upgrade. If you don't see this, run the 30-30-30 restart again. I had to do it twice.4. Start the firmware upgrade utility. It should detect the router and reload the firmware. Follow the instructions on the screen and you should have a functional router in a few minutes!",,,
2782,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,30-Jan-12,A3HQKIJ6ZFQB87,Excellent Wireless Router,"02/02/2012 UPDATE:  I disabled the 5 GHz transmitter.  Because both of our (essentially) new Lenovo laptops only use the 2.4 GHz frequency, there is NO difference in throughput.NOTICE:  Before I begin my review, I want to state I have serious doubts about this Netgear WNDR3700v2 router.  I bought this WNDR3700v2 last year and never had the chance to install it until now. AFTER I bought it, I have read too many reviews where customers are saying the unit does well at first.  After 3-6 months the WNDR3700v2 starts to lose range and then burns out.  It appears the transmitters get hot and then burn out.  If this happens, I will delete this review and write a negative one.MY REVIEW:  I didn't want this Netgear WNDR3700v2 wireless router broadcasting in my bedroom where my cable modem is located.  I bought 2 - 50 foot CAT5E cables from MonoPrice and installed the router on a wall in the next room.  I think it's safer that way.  I installed the WNDR3700v2 up high on the wall so it would have better range and it would not fall over.  I did not use the included stand.  Aside from the cable placement problems, setup was easy.  I set everything up including both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz SSID's, password and WPA2 encryption type using the Setup Wizard on the CD.  I then accessed the router using my browser and changed the hardware router password.  I also upgraded the firmware to the latest version 1.0.0.12 using Netgear's file I had previous downloaded.  The upgrade was done through the Ethernet cable on my main desktop system.  Everything went smoothly, except I waited a LONG time to install the router.  I had grave doubts as to its range and durability.  However, everything seems to be running well right now.  Amazingly, wireless throughput is just as fast as my Ethernet connection at 6,499 kbps!!!  That is really incredible!  I never would have believed a wireless connection could be so FAST!!!Because I do not use the 5 GHz frequency, I plan to disable it through the router browser access menu.  I read the router will run cooler without the second 5 GHz transmitter running.  I just hope this Netgear WNDR3700v2 router lasts at least 3 years the way it's supposed to.  See my pic's in the pic's section for this product.",,,
2790,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,29-Jan-12,A1RMFP15HVUT3V,"Good quality, feature complete, performance.","Real fast compared to my 'g' ISP provided router. Plugged my NAS on its gigaport and the devices I backup are recent Apple products so they support 'n' networks; therefore my backups are now 5 times faster, a real pleasure. Streaming is done with the Apple TV and is also way faster: no sluggishness anymore, movies, even high def, load in less than 3 seconds. Signal quality is also much better.The administration web interface is good as well. It's suitable for network experts, letting them the option to fiddle with everything, said settings being called with their actual names (for instance it's written 'NAT', not 'address hiding'), and it's also suitable for non techies as it has wizards. I also like how it self-updates when you load the interface.It's feature complete: it has all you can expect. IPv6, DHCP reservation, port forwarding, firewalling, WIFI repeater mode (usually a separate expensive device), email alerting, QoS, dynamic DNS support, guest networks... you name it. I didn't try the NAS function though but I wouldn't recommend as it seems really basic.Great product, and, on top of that, I bought it refurbished for 60$. It didn't look refurbished at all: when I opened it my wife asked 'i thought you were buying refurbished?'.",,,

A handful of namebrand ones fit the bill and the price range (under $120).  I had to rule out Linksys as I had just purchased a lemon from they and they wouldnt fix it (wont go into details on that).  Anyhow I plugged in the 3700 and it just WORKED! Didnt have to jump through any hoops or anything.  Then I set up each wireless network with its on SSID manually but I suppose the GUI would have done it just as easily.  It's paired to a Motorola SB6121 modem and the system is awesome.  It hasnt dropped connection, locked up or anything bad so far.  On wireless Ive connected iPads, iPhones, Dell Latitude laptops and IBM laptops.  The LAN side of it has 3 desktop PC's connected at all times (gaming rigs).My previous Linksys router would either lock up or get real sluggish and needed to be reboot every other week.

My speeds were 6mbps, fine for streaming HD Netflix.  Well, Santa brought the kids both an iPod Touch so now they are all over the internet (Netflix streaming mostly).  My 6mbps service was starting to choke under all the use.  Did a little research and it turns out Charter was running a $19.99 special for 15mbps service.  How could I say no?I signed up online and two days later it was installed.  Only problem, is now I have a bandwidth cap of 100Gb per month.  Having no way to monitor my usage, I researched and found that Netgear routers have a Traffic Meter for just this purpose.  You set our monthly cap and it will worn you when you get near it and warn when you have hit it.  In addition, you can track usage by the day, week, and month.  I find this very handy.I replaced a Linksys WRT600N which, other than requiring daily unplugs to keep the router up, was a great router.  The WNDR3700v2 is better.  I have read complaints that v2 has low 5Ghz coverage and speed.  Not in my case.  I am getting wireless connection speeds on 5Ghz that exceed the WRT600N.  I also have not had to unplug the router yet.  Imagine.The build quality is nice, but not as heavy a router as I would have thought.

(looking at you Charter...). I decided to buy this when it wen't on sale and i have to say i am incredibly pleased. I simply connected the router to the modem supplied by charter and followed the easy set up steps to password protect my wifi. I don't think i will ever use the shared USB info, but the range is good enough to cover 2 stories of my high-rise so i'm pretty happy with the results!My previous U-verse router kept failing and misassigning IP addresses which was extremely frustrating, and for $48 a month i expected a lot more. With this router i get 50 mbps download and 5 mbps upload. In addition the 5ghz option is really nice if you have a lot of devices on the 2.4 ghz and want a private network to connect for a dedicated network. This was pretty key since my dad isn't technologically advanced, but he needs to pull up patient files from the hospital.

I've looked at DD-WRT and it supports the N600 so I'm contemplating moving to that to see what benefits I can get.A couple of notes. As with all Netgear firmware, I find the setup page to be difficult to navigate and understand (compared to Tomato). I like that there aren't any antenna's and that it sits vertically. But I will say that the lights on this thing could light a runway. They are in a closet and I can see the flickering under the door.

I have dual computers at my home office and the gigabit wired connection was a welcomed upgrade from the SMC 10/100. The Guest wireless network is an awesome feature that would be good  if you have a lot of guests visiting and want to allow them to get to the internet  but not access your home computers. The buit in dynamic dns updater if great if you utilize network 'NannyCams'. I don't really have a use for the Network attached USB Storage, but its a neat add-on if you decide to share files to all the computers on your home network. It has a rather long 'bootup'  sequence (1-3 minutes)  so I would not recomend turning it off to often. But I DO like the fact that it has an on/off button in case I need to reset it due to your modem needing to be powercycled. ( I hate having to unplug something and then chase the cord when it falls behind the desk) I also like that you can turn the wireless off seprately. Good for telling guests its time to go without having to shut it all down.  Has plenty of routing, priority, and parental controls. I am a net admin, so for me the interface seems straight forward and self explanatory. The interface has a very detailed description of what each setting does in a sidebar for those not so experienced. When I first set this device up it checked for updates and found a few already.

2961,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,2,11-Nov-11,A1SQLBLXQDI4B7,After lots of investigation and comparison,"My D-Link DI-624 started giving trouble; more trouble that is. It always had the problem of rebooting when more than one RJ-45 LAN ports were connected and active. So, I had another switch connected to only one of its LAN ports, and DI-624 was my wireless AP and internet gateway/switch without affecting my internal network. That was all fine when I had only one WiFi device active at once. Things have changed, and I have multiple WiFi devices active simultaneously, and DI-624 started crapping out: reboots, infinite delays and just dropping one or more of the WiFi connections. It was time to get a better Firewall/WirelessAP.I gave up on D-Link with my rather extensive home network (several switches, multiple floors, heteregoneous devices, wired/wireless of all sorts, media streaming, etc.), and started looking at 'better' ones. I don't want to pay a real Cisco router I use at work, so dumb it down and look at LinkSys or NetGear. Well, it was a tought decision, actually. NetGear won at the end not only because I had a number of Netgear switches already and they work without a glitch for many years. It won because its detailed specs; also, this device sits somewhere in the back of something else where no one looks at other than me peeking at it every now and then - not that it malfunctions. Cisco/LinkSys one appear too shiny with less advanced features.This is not perfect. I don't care about the USB NAS drive; I have real stuff for that - so I am not going to comment on it. Otherwise, this thing just works in my environment. No problem NetFlix/YouTube/etc. streaming at all. WiFi (I only tested 2.4GHz so far) works with multiple devices active at the same time: I tested with 5 simultaneous devices so far spread across the guest and internal network (yes, that separation is a must for me, and it works, AFAICT).What is missing? DNS setting is very primitive. I want to specify an internal DNS server with scoping, and then want to say 'for all others, relay to DNS you received from WAM DHCP'. This is pretty common with private DNS servers (think NAT). NetGear, I like your products, but do you hear this? It is not a big deal, add that on, please.",,,
2967,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,5-Nov-11,A1FZ8SS1MG9TSA,Perfect Upgrade from Linksys,"Prior to ordering this Netgear product, I had always used Linksys WRT products. However, the prior router (despite upgrading to the latest firmware) would constantly drop connections, require reboots, and would randomly stop even though the administration page said everything was working fine.Now, we have no drop-outs, the range seems to go further and penetrate parts of the apartment better, and all apartment residents can reliably skype, netflix, and facetime all at the same time without interruption. Highly recommended for a workhorse router.",,,
2970,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,1-Nov-11,ASWKP90MECS2M,Great Security!,I researched this wireless router before I purchased it and I am extremely happy with the performance.  It was fairly simple to setup.  I like the security of being able to lock down the wireless to certain mac address.  Works like a charm!,,,
2971,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,30-Oct-11,A1M217S8GBEBQ6,Easy set up,"Plug it in, install the CD and it easily walks you through the set up. Could not be easier.  The speed it gives me is surprisingly fast (I guess I didn't realize how bad my previous ten year old g router was).  Good product that does its job well.",,,
2972,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,27-Oct-11,AFLDLQHPSLAG2,Works gr8,Love the 2 bands as not all of the items I have can use 1gb transfer.  Ordered the USB adapter for my laptop so I could utilize the higher speed.  Seller was smart & included it in the package making everything simple for both of us.,,,

2976,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,23-Oct-11,A13T8UUU0M3TLV,Buy This Router,"The WNDR3700 was highly recommended to me by a co-worker, and after a couple days of research and browsing online, I decided to order it. It arrived on time, and only took about 10 minutes to set up.I regularly play shooters on my 360, download music to my computer (connected to the 5GHz network), have two smartphones connected to the 2.4GHz wireless network, often all at once. I have yet to experience any lag during gameplay or significant decrease in download speed. With my 16 gig flash drive plugged into the router's USB port, movies and music can be streamed to any device connected to the network (haven't tried on my phone yet, but my computer and xBox 360 stream flawlessly)Overall, I could not be happier with this purchase, and will be recommending it to my friends and family should they be in the market for a new router.",,,
2980,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,1,19-Oct-11,AUBE7BGD3SUCI,Netgear Router Review,"I was hesitant to tackle this installation myself, but needn't have been.  The hardware instantly recognized the signal.  It was almost ridiculously easy to set up the laptop, telephone and AV equipment connections to recognize the available strong signal.  Security precautions were easy to set up.  All in all, no mystery to it.  I should not have waited so long to take the big step!",,,
2988,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,13-Oct-11,A19YFDWRXHD5CS,Netgear N600 Wireless Dual Band Router WNDR3700,Easy to setup.  Had one of the exact same type for about 3-4 months before purchasing this one for a family member.  For obvious reasons was even easier to setup!  I have DSL.  I'm able to use my smart phone to connect via the router (resulting in downloads faster to my phone).,,,
2990,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,10-Oct-11,A2TJYKPG0ZOOEE,Really good router,"Pros:  Good for almost all purpose.  I use it with openWRT, as a samba share server and the router.  It is stable and fast.  I just rebooted it once after about 1 month high pressure use.Cons:  A little expensive.  The USB speed is not very good, it is only about 6MB/s, which is far far slower for the external hard drive.If you do not use USB much, it is really good.  For me, the USB speed is enough, my house don't have that much stuff to share.",,,
2994,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,2,7-Oct-11,A3ADQW6TACZE73,Good Constant Signal Strength...and some basic recommendations,"I purchased this Netgear router 6 months ago to replace an older model Linksys router with antennas, which had replaced an even older Linksys, also with antennas.  It's difficult to make a comparison due to the fact that the Linksys was using a `g' band, while I'm using the `n' band on this Netgear - although both are at 2.4GHz.  But I can say the Netgear has more signal strength.  I actually have it sitting flat, rather than upright.  I would say signal strength has increased by 1/3 at the least - and it's consistent.The wifi is approximately 21+ yards away (on the same ground floor), going through 4 walls at full signal strength.Setup was easy (Windows XP wired, Windows 7 Professional wifi).  The software disc (which is the Setup Wizard) included is not Windows 7 compatible, although you can download it at Netgear's site.  I didn't bother with it.  I followed the easy instructions in the manual, and once online at the router's login, there is a setup Wizard which will work with your OS if you choose to use it.  I just set it up manually, which is very easy.  The router recognized my other wifi devices easily, and further setup was a breeze.  My Linksys froze for 30 minutes or longer when applying changes.  The Netgear does so within a few seconds.Having Dual Bands is a bonus, although currently I do not have any `n' band 5.0GHz capable devices - and have disabled the 5.0GHz for now... but it's there for the future.I don't wish to repeat all the options this router offers as others have already done so in good detail.  I would however like to emphasize a few Basic things for those unfamiliar with router setups:1) Once you are connected, do upgrade the firmware before proceeding.2) Please, please change the login Password from the Default (listed in the manual which comes with the router) to your own.  Half my neighbors have not.  This is just basic and so easily done - and will keep others from piggybacking, or worse yet, logging into your router and changing the settings and using their own login password to lock you out (if this has already happened you'll need to Reset your router manually and start all over).  Once you login to the router's address, you'll find it listed under Maintenance at Set Password.  Keep track of all your passwords!  One of my neighbors could no longer gain access to the internet and blamed it on the router... I had seen that it was initially not secured, and later secure.  I'm guessing a neighboring kid just decided to mess around.  Fortunately they mentioned this to me (before just buying another router) and I helped them get back online.2a) Set up a secure connection.  Again, I 'see' too many who haven't set any type of security.  At your Netgear router login page, go to Setup, and underneath are options for both Wireless Settings (your wifi) and Guest Network. Type in your own SSID (name) - don't leave it at the Default name.  Set up a security option and type in your own Passphrase password... it is strongly recommended you not use WEP for the Guest Network if this can be avoided (I don't think this Netgear even has WEP for Wireless Settings, but it does for the Guest Network).  Again, keep a record of these.  Use strong passwords, both uppercase and lowercase letters, mixed with numbers and symbols - and make it long.Just these basic steps should keep neighbors and drive-by's from piggybacking your connection, which at the least can slow down your internet connection speed or cause intermittent loss of connectivity if you have quite a few piggybackers.Remember to occasionally login to see if there are any upgrades for your router.I'm very happy with this router, and would recommend it.  I will update later should I run into any problems.Update: I've been using this router for 3 months and it's still working very well - wifi remains strong and consistant.  I do use the power button frequently (hold it about 2-3 seconds to power on/off for wifi.  Can even use the power button if laptops are booted and our internet connection is almost immediate.  I remain extremely pleased with this router!2nd Update: It's been 1 month short of a year since purchasing, and this router is still working perfectly.  For a brief time I thought perhaps I'd bricked it when my Ethernet port died on our desktop (routers tend to be terribly fussy about such things), but nope!  The router had been unused for about 1  months while I made the decision to purchase another desktop as opposed to replacing the port.  My laptops wouldn't connect wirelessly after setting up the router again, but 2 other Wi-Fi devices were fine, so thankfully both laptops just needed a driver upgrade.  All is well with this Dual Band Netgear Router and I am still happy with this purchase.",,,

With the old router i would top out at 8 and i thought it was an isp issue but on installing the netgear I immediately saw and increase to 22! I use this router to connect my lg TV wirelessly, ipad, desktop, and laptop and even with all of them running i can watch a streaming movie on the tv from netflix, a live mlb game on the laptop and be playing a online game with the desktop which was impossible to do with the old router.The setup was very very easy after reading some reviews I was a little worried but everything is running great.

3099,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,18-Sep-11,A2MOJANFPX353G,Best Router I have ever had.,"I replaced a very old (Version 2) WRT54G wired/wireless B/G router with this N600 model a few days ago. The first thing I noticed was that the B/G signal was much better at the far ends of my house. At least 30% and in some areas almost 50% more signal.My existing wireless G desktop, at the far end of my house reports 99% signal strength, with my old router the signal would average around 60%.Using 'dslreports' online speed test, I was able to get a down load speed of 7.4 Mb/s and an up load speed of 856 Kb/s on the wireless G connection. I have a cable modem and the upload speed is throttled.The exciting thing for me is the wireless N performance. My new Windows 7 laptop, with a wireless N connection, at the far end of my house, gets 15.5 Mb/s down load speed and 850 Kb/s upload speed. My wired connection is 19.4 Mb/s and 861 Kb/s. With a cable modem, the speed varies but my old router's best down load speed was 17 Mb/s on the wired connection.The USB shared connection is a nice feature. I was having trouble sharing files between my Windows 7 computer and my Windows XP computers. I connected an 8 Gig. USB thumb drive to this router, set it up as a share, and my problem was solved. One thing to note; the Win 7 computer did not automatically see the share (funny, because it automatically saw the media server on the share). I had to type in the address of the router (in my case 192.168.1.1) and browse to the shared folder. After that, I was able to map it as a shared drive.If something changes in the future, I will edit this review. At this point in time, I am very happy with this device.Ken",,,
3101,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,2,15-Sep-11,A3VY2I7L97HFPR,Excellent wireless router with many features.,"I bought the REFURBed router and would highly recommend it.You essentially have 4 wireless networks:  2.4 GHz guest  5 GHz guest  2.4 GHz  5 GHzAll are active simultaneously.  The guest network is on the same IP range as your non-guest machines however, they are isolated and only have access to the internet.USB port allows for internal FTP, HTTP, network shares to the files on a jump/hard drive.  You can also allow internet access with FTP and HTTP.USB port allows for DLNA (media server).  I have JPG's, MP3's, and different video files.  Some Video files worked fine others were choppy and others wouldn't play.  Still need to do more testing here.  Also, I don't know the limitations, but it worked as expected when I had a small number of files.  But when it had to index over 100 GB of files I overwhelmed it.  So, for me it's not a replacement for my iPod, but I think if you use it more resonably, it is great.This was a replacement to my old wireless router which I used to have to reboot every few days by unplugging and plugging back in.  This has been up for a few weeks continuously with no problems.I have up to 30 MB download with my internet cable connection.  My old router was only allowing me to see about 8 MB...this one routinely sees results of 25-30 MB/s. I use speedtest.net for testing.This has all the normal router functions you'd expect...Port Forwarding, DHCP, etc.  It is supposedly better for video streaming.",,,
3109,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,13-Sep-11,A49MSR09HHU85,Finally getting everything out of my internet connection.,"I absolutely love this router.  I recently received a promotional speed upgrade to my internet connection for six months.  My old WTR54G became a huge bottleneck.  Upgrading to the WNDR3700 has drastically improved my speeds.  The throughput on the gigabit ports and the 5GHZ networks work as fast as a direct connection to my modem.  Wireless G is still throttled to about 30mbs, but it's still an improvement.  Maybe if I can get rid of that one WPA/TKIP device.....",,,
3127,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,9-Sep-11,ABZBT87NLFXRC,Worth the money,"Overall this router is just extremely convenient. It would be nice if you could also restrict mack addresses and Ethernet. The level of multitasking is amazing. I have been on Xbox live, while my little sister was on her WII, I was also loading 720p YouTube videos, and had my phone connected on Facebook and Twitter, all at the same time. And guess what! No lag! The only way I could see someone purchasing a different router at around the time I post this review is if they are buying a newer model.",,,

My wife and I use a lot of Sametime chat to talk and she never had a dropped connection once, while my D-link will drop the connection once or twice (could be how Apple devices work with the routers, I dont know).

Speeds are very fast on both G and N and the built-in gigabit ethernet performs well. I haven't had to reboot the router in nearly six months of operation. There are tons of great features: I especially like the bandwidth meter and support for reserved IP addresses via DHCP.This is my fifth wireless router in about eight years. I have owned a DLink, Belkin and two Linksys routers (one died after six months and had to be RMA'd). Every one that I owned would freeze up periodically and needed to be rebooted to get back online. The wireless connection on my Droid X would drop repeatedly with my old Linksys but with the Netgear it's been totally stable.

First there were the 6 steps (with nice, large illustrations) on the card that came with the router.  Then I inserted the CD (step 6).  I think it automatically loads if you are using Windows, but nothing happened for me, so I did have to use my brains to double-click the CD and then double click the icon marked MAC.  After that I just clicked my way through the wizard, gave each of the two bands names (I called them 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz), and assigned a password.

It works exactly as described.  I think the documentation could be a little easier to find and use (how about a quickstart guide for the non-techy?).  But overall love this router and very glad I purchased it. Biggest issue was the post office obliterated the box it came in (looked like it was dropped from a 5 story building!).

I wish the price was a little lower but otherwise it looks and works great. Setup and configuration was a breeze as usual with other Netgear routers.

I had to let everyone know how happy I am with my router.This router was exactly what I was looking for.  I moved into a two story house and wanted to finally transition to wireless-N to get the range and speed that our macbooks can handle.  We were previously using a WRT54G and I don't remember having to reset it too many times but it wasn't perfect.I have had this router running since the end of April.  I have only disconnected the power once when I decided to move my cable modem into another room.  Other than that it has required no maintenance or resets.I didn't used the CD for setup and I can agree with others in saying that the web interface is a little unorganized I was able to get though it without too much trouble.  I do not like that the username for the web login is stuck on admin. I did a little research and it seems like that is an option you cannot change.I have been using the USB storage and I like that I am able to get to my files away from the house, I did have to reformat my drive to get the router to recognize it the first time (I think it was formatted  MAC OS journaled).  I have been using the storage to backup pictures because my wife got a new camera so there was a need to put them somewhere in an organized fashion, which meant it had to be seperate from her macbook.We normally have at least 3-4 wireless devices runnning in our house (iphones, laptops, wiis, xbox).  I have never had any lockups or serious lag.  I get really good range from this router (I have it upstairs above the living room).  I am able to connect with a macbook or iphone in my garage or outside which is down one floor and through a few walls.I have really enjoyed this router and I hope to get some good use out of it in the future.  It has way more features than my old router and it looks alot nicer too.",,,
3250,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,2,2,2-Aug-11,A2RWTTL0N2WDOY,Excellent Router!,"I've had an older Netgear 802.11 router for about 8 years with no problems, but I felt it was time to upgrade. I stream a lot of Netflix movies, and they often hiccup and kick me out, so I wanted to upgrade to wireless N capability. I also wanted the ability to access a shared network hard drive, and have the faster gigabit connections for hardwiring my TiVo directly to the router, which led me to purchase this router. The first one arrived and was incredibly easy to set up (I was already familiar with the Netgear setup because of my older router). It worked great for about 12 hours, but when I got up the next morning, it was offline and all the lights were off. I tried every trick I could think of to bring it back up, but nothing worked. I finally called Netgear support, and he had me basically do everything I had just done with no luck. I went to the Amazon website and submitted the form to return the faulty equipment. I've never had to return anything to Amazon and wasn't sure how much of a pain it would be, but it was simple and painless. My new router arrived 24 hours later. It took me just a few minutes to set up. So far, it's amazing. Netflix streams perfectly and is very high quality (it used to look pixelated and blurry). And the ability to access a hard drive from all computers in the house is really convenient. Very much worth the money.",,,
3291,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,27-Jul-11,A221FENIFIK1SU,Does the job!,The range of the 2nd band is pretty tame but overall it provides great coverage for our three story house (with the router nestled in the basement in the concrete laundry room). Good throughput on all counts. Can't say I notice a big difference in speed with the 2nd band either.,,,
3293,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,20-Jul-11,A1L9OBVB4T70AT,Replaced my CISCO E3000,I bought this as a replacement for my 8 month old Cisco/Linksys E3000 which kicked butt for 8 months. I had an issue with extreme slow down. My cable company was able to troubleshoot it to my router. I contacted Cisco Tech support and they said because it was over 90 days old I had to pay them $79.95 for them to help me. You got to be kidding me! Some customer service. That will be my last Cisco/Linksys product. Now that I'm over my rant on to Netgear WNDR3700. The CD that came with unit was useless. Could't install using their install as could not find the connection. I just used Windows 7 to install it with no problem. Log'd in to the router and made my changes and it worked great. Been a month with no issues with speeds as high as 42 mbps when checked with speed test in my backyard. It is much faster to print than my E3000 which was painfully slow to print. Just hope that if I ever have an issue that they don't charge me to talk to them.,,,
3294,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,17-Jul-11,A2HEEZBGEFQVJD,"Excellent router, somewhat difficult to setup","When I bought this router, I decided to take my chances and go with a refurbished one. It saved me about $50. It came with, what I believe, to be all the standard accessories from a new box. The problem was that the CD that came with the box for the newer version of the router that I received. No biggy, I'm fairly tech literate, well literate enough to set it up manually. The web interface is pretty messy and it took quite some time (15 or 20 minutes) to setup.I've had it for a couple weeks now and I must say, I'm loving it! The router has never crashed or stopped working. I used to have the newest (and worst) version of the WRT54G. It sucked. Whenever I used network intensive activities such as bittorent, it crashes. It could only manage maybe 3 maybe 4 active computers at any given time. (Keep in mind there's normally 6, sometimes 7 active computers!) But with this new router it works perfectly, haven't had to restart it at all since I've had it.",,,
3303,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,12-Jul-11,A2KPOD9CAKA5IT,So Much Flexibility,"Great router. It came in the mail today and, after fiddling around with it and connecting my computer directly into the cable modem to find its configuration website/login information, I was able to setup both the 2.4 GHz and 5GHz bands and advanced options that I needed quite quickly. Speaking of the separate network frequencies, they are very nice for organizing my more high bandwidth activities from the lower ones. Not to mention that the configuration website allows for easy firmware updates and thoroughly explains all possible networking options as you peruse/edit them. The only problem I foresee is this refurb I bought possibly crapping out (knock on wood!). But so far so good!Oh, and the fact that each band frequency has its own guest network means I could really create 4 networks if I wanted to. But in a house of 3 people that seems a bit much.",,,
3304,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,9-Jul-11,A2BZ07FTKM1TM1,Netgear N600 Gigabit Router WNDR3700,This router rocks I have Comcast  and the speed increase was off the charts. I'm now streaming HD video and I have 300Mpbs throughput. I paired it with a Moto Docsis 3.0 modem and they are doing me justice.If you are a novice or pro you will love this router. Buy it you won't be disappointed.,,,
3305,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,9-Jul-11,A3T2J7YMQT11Y2,"Easy Set-Up, Very Fast","I upgraded my Comcast to 50mbs speed from the old 15mbs speed and had a DLink DIR655 router. The DLINK seemed to need to be reset fairly often so I bought the $179 Apple Airport Extreme that was so highly rated. I hooked up the Apple and ran my speedtests and was only getting 6mbs transfer rate on the two laptops I have that are wireless. The direct connect computers ran just fine. Someone recommonded this Netgear model and I returned the Apple for this. Setup was about 15 minutes, simple and CD included. It took perhaps another 30 minutes to figure out how to add in my wireless printer, but that is not Netgears fault. I re-ran the tests and get over 20mbs now via wireless, over 3 times the speed of the Apple router and am very impressed! I also get a stong signal considering the router is in a lower level. I am very happy with this purchase.",,,
3306,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,8-Jul-11,A2RA20ZDNPY34,great for home,I previously had a gateway I was leasing from Comcast for 7 bucks a month. The range was not ok as I had to punch through several walls and the signal attenuation was pretty large. This unit is everything promised. I now have 3 systems hooked up (wifes Toshiba Satellite and two desktops(windows 7 and xp)). The installation was so simple even I didn't screw it up. If you can load a cd you can do this.The 'push and connect' technology is pretty slick. I think someone had mentioned that the unit got quite hot. I have not experienced that yet. I keep it up high and well ventilated.I'm sure that helps. I was also intrigued by the 'ready share' feature where you can plug in an external USB storage unit. I had 500 G seagate external I plugged in. It works really fine. Just like a file server would. The biggest problem in getting my network setup was the clowns at comcast when I swapped out the modem. It took about an hour and two call backs but we 'got er done'. I couldn't be happier. This is a good unit for the home and well worth the price.,,,
3307,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,6-Jul-11,AXANLDKGSLDKG,Easy and fast setup.,"Great, this is one heck of a router, Easy to setup and very easy to adjest the little extras that come with it. Everything from a Wii to full HD video streamed over this ,,without a problem.",,,
3308,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,5-Jul-11,A1CWNLFOZ67XEC,Netgear is Great,"Haven't had this netgear long enough to give it a five star on everything, but so far it has worked well. Had a little trouble setting it up to my network, but with help from Netgear it went well.  Took a second Tech. to get us online, but the second tech was Great.  I can't say the first tech was helpful, but recalled and the second tech knew his job. We have it connected to a switch as I have 6-computers wired and 2 computers wireless as my grandkids do their homework online.No problem so far.",,,
3309,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,4-Jul-11,A2U8Q6AC6BBBCL,Netgear N600 wired/wireless dual band WNDR3700 router,"Going from Linksys to Netgear was a pure pleasure!!  Setup very intuitive, firmware upgrade painless.  If you have used the other router throw it in the trash along with the other product support and get the N600 wired/wireless dual band router,",,,
3311,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,2-Jul-11,A1Q0RHL0GYQ7QV,router solved all my network problems,"Before I bought this Netgear router, I had used an eight year old router. I kept having problems with intermittent wireless network, poor range. My Comcast cable modem box had to be reset maybe once every month, otherwise I would lose TV cable signal. I thought my Comcast signal was poor.After I switched to this Netgear router, all the aforementioned problems disappeared.  It has been about 45 days since I bought the router. Never once did I have to reset the Comcast cable modem box.  I have much stronger wireless signal now.  I live in a three bedroom house with about 6000 sq ft yard. I can receive wireless coverage anywhere in the yard, although the wireless signal strength is not maximum in the yard.The 'readyshare' USB port is useful, but I find the speed of this port rather slow compared to a direct USB connection to a computer.",,,
3312,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,1-Jul-11,A3OZCUJNGWDJ0D,Much better,Great product.. no problems so far (been a month or two)... solid.  The NAS drive USB jack is nice for being able to provide storage.. wish there was a way to power down the usb jack after a timeout period or something.Otherwise a great product.,,,
3321,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,3,29-Jun-11,A2MPDFAERBM1M6,Netgear N600 WNDR3700 vs. Cisco anything.,"Today I have purchased this Netgear WNDR3700 Dual-band router. And I have done so on the strength of this article: [...]Cisco had been on my wish list since purchasing my N-equipped laptop some years ago; and only needed the router failure to justify the new purchase. After seeing that article, moments before coming to Amazon for the purchase, I decided that I would not buy Cisco -- under any circumstances.I am frankly getting very tired of this type of reverse bigotry, where a handful of radicals castigate everyone into  some 'cum-by-ya', we must all 'I'm OK, you're OK' -- and then summarily fire someone for their own opinions. Nah. Cisco's out.Personally (which I know isn't going to play well with heavy tech-heads), I don't care HOW this thing works. Whether it gets 140MB down instead of 148MB is inconsequential to me. I'm still giving it five stars; and as long as the thing works serviceably well, I'm going with the far weightier issues.",,,
3322,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,28-Jun-11,A3PQW6BZHZDE0R,NETGEAR RANGEMAX WNDR3700 -- Great!!,"This is a great router/access point. Its range is terrific and is both easy to set up and use. My old dLink died recently and I wanted to improve the wifi throughout the house. Not only did the Netgear improve the connection speeds, but I used to have some conflict that would cause the dLink to drop the wired connection (with Comcast) every day or so. Never did figure it out, but the Netgear does not suffer from the same difficulty. The Netgear is a little more expensive, but it's worth it!",,,
3330,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,21-Jun-11,AJDP54CXI6CTW,Consistently Amazing Router,"This has been the best router I have ever purchased.  It just works.I have had this router for nearly a year, which replaced a previous router that offered the same 'speed' but would constantly drop connections and require a reboot.  The only time this router has required a reboot is when I change the settings.Another neat feature of this router is the 'Guest WiFi - Hotspot' feature which allows you to do just what it says.  With this feature you can create a second access point for guests that can not see your shared files and you can limit the bandwidth that is available.I have been meaning to open up about 500k of free bandwidth for local smart phones that need connectivity.I wish all routers/ access points made it easy to share some portion of your wifi so we had good open coverage.If you are undecided about a router, stop thinking and buy this one.",,,
3331,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,20-Jun-11,ATLHK23MET0CD,Netgear WNDR3700 -- NICE! !!!,"I got this as an early father's day gift, and so far so good.I got up and running in about 30 minutes including my USB External drive.  Overall a very good router, and very easy to setup.  The web based config interface is very nice and intuitive to use.  This was a big deal for me coming form a linksys router, and 'knowing' linksys were the easiest to setup.  The app is very straight forward, very simple to use and understand.  I particularly liked the layout of it because is broken into 3 panes (windows) the main selection/menu on the left, the content in the middle, and definition and help content on the right....describing what the immediate features you are setting up are and they do.  I know my way around these things, but it was nice to have there as a backup in case I had any doubts on what I was doing.With that said, I did encounter a few issues getting the router connect (recognize) the modem.  after a few attempts, and tricks I was able to get to connect and get into the web based configuration app.  It prompt me to update firmware, and I did. but I found that the latest firm ware lacked or lost functionality that i had right out of the box.  When I tried to revert back to the original FW, it bricked!I took it back to the store I purchased it, and they replaced it.  With the replacement unit, the router connected to the modem instantly, I had the network setup with 5 minutes, and the USB drive in another 5 minutes.  I spent about another 20 min setting up the rest of devices to the new router, and everything works perfectly...just as expected.  What I did not expect was how easy it was to setup.Summary:PROS:- Very easy to setup!- 4 Networks in one device a private 2.4 Ghz and 5Ghz network, and two guest networks for each band.  This ia plus for me since I let one of my neighbors use my WiFi for free....now she, and any visitor, can have a network, and I can separate my devices from their view.- USB device connectivity is not as slow as many have complained.  I transferred files via FTP from work in seconds, very fast and responsive.-Good range, I have a two story town home, and I have great signal all overCONS:- Device is a bit bulky- Shinny materials get dirty very easy (I'm nit picking here...)Overall I would highly recommend to others....in fact I already have!  I don't think you would be disapointed with it.",,,
3349,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,0,15-Jun-11,A1BPIGRHAORHBR,Great Router,"Reburb unit came packed well, like new and with cd.  About 5 minutes to install and be surfing.  5G is great, the rangeis good in my two bedroom unit.  When running netstumbler I find up to 28 access points on 2.4, which created too muchtraffic for good speed on wireless, the 5G band is wide open and broadband speed tests consistently run at full wiredspeeds under 5G wireless.  I recommend this refurb unit for any apartment type setting.",,,

I wanted to wirelessly connect to a Roku box  which is separated from the router by a double floor and a couple of walls.  It did so with excellent signal strength.",,,
3358,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,1,12-Jun-11,A3MIA3YTRHUHTM,Suprisingly good,"I am not an expert in routers, but I knew that our old $40 router just wasn't working right.  I went to [...] and this was listed as the best.  The setup was quick and easy and I have noticeably faster internet browsing than ever before.  Now that we are consistently using 2-3 computers in our 6-member family it was important to have a router that would consistently work well.  This meets the bill.  I did not expect to spend this much, but it is much more reliable than our old $40 router.",,,
3368,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,1,7-Jun-11,AGFWYCUP5BILL,Love it,"I had a DLink DIR655 that was probably straining with all of the devices I had on it - 2 iphones, an ipad, twolaptops, a desktop and occasionally one more laptop.  My main laptop was taking hours to download a 600 mb file that I receive every week.  Tried a different mini card, no difference.I bought the Netgear 3700 and what a change.  My laptop and ipad are on the 5g channel, everything else is on the 2.4g channel.My laptop downloads are very quick now -8-10x at the least faster on the 600 gb file.  Consistently connecting at 270-300 wirelessly,my wife's laptop is at a steady 150.  I'm on Comcast cable and the router is the only change I made in the set up.  This one is a keeper.Hasn't dropped a connection yet.",,,

3387,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,0,2,29-May-11,A29XI5BCEZLSUX,Netgear kicks butt!!!!!!,"our way old router couldn't keep up with modern speeds. this one ROCKS big time!!!! ya gotta punch in all kinda stuff, but way worth it. we have a paper file folder with all the ports and ISP data crapola, so no sweat. we tried a Cisco plug 'n play thing that had good signal strength, but wouldn't connect to the net, GONG!! big waste of time.......",,,
3389,XX,B002HWRJY4,5,1,2,27-May-11,AA0J4J0GPDJ1G,Super fast and easy to use,"Originally I ordered a WNDR4000 but that was a total pain.  I wasted hours searching knowledge bases, calling my ISP and calling Netgear with no result.  I returned it and bought the WNDR3700 instead.The WNDR3700 was able to automatically detect many of my ISP's settings.  I had it up and running in just a couple minutes.Did I mention this thing is fast?  I love it!!!",,,
