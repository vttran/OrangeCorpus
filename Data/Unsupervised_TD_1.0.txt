Hi - decided to drop a few lines and hopefully save some headache to potential new buyers of this brick of an equipment.	0	0	0	0	0	0
Unfortunately I ended up buying this router after reading the reviews on Amazon.	0	0	0	0	0	0
Lots of people complained about its unreliability however few people mentioned that with the DD-WRT software the router would work fine.	0	0	0	0	0	0
Anyhow...I bought it and initially installed it with the default Linksys firmware.	0	0	0	0	0	0
The router was running super slow via wi-fi.	0	0	0	0	0	0
With direct connect cable speed was OK but via Wi-Fi it was unbelievably slow.	0	0	0	0	0	0
So I decided to upgrade the firmware to DD-WRT.	0	0	0	0	0	0
After installing this firmware the change in speed was dramatic - as good as with direct connection via LAN cable.	0	0	0	0	0	0
Unfortunately the router started dropping connections all the time.	0	0	0	0	0	0
I fiddled with multiple settings based on recommendations I found online however no luck.	0	0	0	0	0	0
This router is a piece of junk and to save your time and money....DO NOT BUY IT.	0	0	0	0	0	0
I personally find the time spent trying to fix this junk more valuable than the $ spent.	0	0	0	0	0	0

This has to be by far the WORST product I ever purchased (next to Belkin) for a router...It drops wireless conections like Iron Man drops bad guys....very lousy range and signal strength...Bring back the antennas...How do you expect to get any range with no external antennas and 1/8th of a watt power??	0	0	0	0	0	0

Heres the explanation: there are 3 versions of this router.	0	0	0	0	0	0
"All of them have suffered from problems with the firmware provided by Linksys to run the router, such as failures to resolve DNS."	0	0	0	0	0	0
"In the case of versions 1 and 3, there have reportedly been improvements in the firmware, their chipsets are based on Broadcom, and version 1 is supported by the 3rd party DD-WRT software program, which is supposed to solve a lot of problems for these routers"	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Version 2, unfortunately, has the Ralink chipset, reduced RAM, has no DD-WRT solution, and as of its latest firmware build cannot resolve DNS for most users."	0	0	0	0	0	0
The best and most common solution for V2 owners seems to be that of downgrading the firmware to build 8.	0	0	0	0	0	0
"I have done this, and my router work fine right now, but there are concerns in the Linksys forums about security risks in this older build, so its not a perfect solution"	0	0	0	0	0	0

Maybe the WRT160N v1 was a decent Wireless-N router.	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Its hard to know, since Linksys now makes only the newer version-2 router, which is awful as a Wireless-N router."	0	0	0	0	0	0
The main problem (and it is a critical one) is that the newer version makes it impossible to both enable the Wide radio band (which delivers the increased bandwidth with wireless-N) and select the channels you want to use (which with the popularity of WiFi and interference arousing from neighboring routers is an absolute necessity).	0	0	0	0	0	0
"The wide radio band is only enabled if you set the options all to auto, which prevents you from selecting the desired channels."	0	0	0	0	0	0
"If you want Wireless-N speeds, youre stuck using channel 1, whether you like it or not"	0	0	0	0	0	0
This is a poor excuse for a router.	0	0	0	0	0	0
Selecting the channels to use has been a baseline feature for wireless routers for almost a decade now.	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had a computor store set up my first router with the laptop for $100.00 including a Belken router- I didnt know diddly beans about routers (Still dont)....BAD Mistake- it quit on me in a few months and knocked my desktop offline too- and never did reach as far as I needed it to...anyway the store insisted it tested fine BUT I couldnt get to work at home and if I connected it it I lost my desktop!	0	0	0	0	0	0
was at Meiers one night and they had this for $50 on sale - decided to try again.....This computor dummy (ME) had NO problems at all installing it and now both computors work online perfectly....Mine is XP and the laptop is Vista....just write down the codes when installing so you dont have to go looking for them to connect other devices like a laptop	0	0	0	0	0	0

I recently had a string of bad luck while trying to replace my ancient B router.	0	0	0	0	0	0
After going through 3 other routers of different brands I finally decided to buy this one.	0	0	0	0	0	0
Routers can have all sorts of problems while setting them up and I think I encountered a lot of them in a short amount of time.	0	0	0	0	0	0
After buying this one I reluctantly started setting it up and was pleasantly surprised to get it up and going in no time!This one also has a lot of extra options that make it the best out there for your money.	0	0	0	0	0	0
"I connected a laptop, a PSP, and a PS3 to my new network with NO problems whatsoever."	0	0	0	0	0	0

"I have my PS3 in a cabinet and could only get about 80% tops with other N routers, but Im always running at 100% with the Linksys."	0	0	0	0	0	0

Security is also a breeze with this beauty.	0	0	0	0	0	0
I couldnt recommend a better router in this price range.	0	0	0	0	0	0

"While this new router looks sleek, I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of its performance."	0	0	0	0	0	0
"The device definitely looks like it had gone the way of the cheap build of Netgear devices, and I worried that it would last as long as the router I was replacing (seems everything is getting disposable these days).Fortunately, my skepticism is wrong"	0	0	0	0	0	0
This router has been a fantastic replacement only making me regret I didnt replace my old router sooner.	0	0	0	0	0	0

The setup of the router is 1000 times better than what I remember with my previous device.	0	0	0	0	0	0
"I remember having a hard time as the previous router required a wired computer, and my ISPs tricky method of sending an IP address that essentially matches the default most routers used made that old router take 8 hours to set-up and a lot of customer support calls, hacking, etc to change the address of the router (a Linksys flaw at that time).Fast forward a few years, and the device and its software essentially self-set itself without needing a direct computer connection."	0	0	0	0	0	0
"The software Linksys provides is likely adequate for most home users, although limits the ability to customize things."	0	0	0	0	0	0

"However, it frequently would time out on eBay, Amazon, Facebook, and other pages that I frequent."	0	0	0	0	0	0
"Really, it timed out on every page I would frequent except for my schools site."	0	0	0	0	0	0
"I figured it was just a glitch in my router, so I exchanged it for the same one."	0	0	0	0	0	0
"That second one worked overnight, but the next day it had similar problems."	0	0	0	0	0	0
