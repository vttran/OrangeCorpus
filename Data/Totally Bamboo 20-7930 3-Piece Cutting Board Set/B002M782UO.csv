1,XX,B002M782UO,4,0,0,9-Apr-14,AZ3CAQCJ2C0TE,Quite Good,Pros: Inexpensive; made out of wood; 3 different sizes in the set; doesn't dull knives; doesn't slide all over the place when using.Cons: Kind of &#34;sheds&#34; splintery bits; have to oil it to keep it from splintering and falling apart; must hand-wash; largest board is still relatively small.
2,XX,B002M782UO,3,0,0,8-Apr-14,AWD9I9BMN5FUM,Okay,"I like having wooden cutting board, but they warped and cracked in the dishwasher. I don't want a cutting board I can't sanitize in the dishwasher."

5,XX,B002M782UO,1,0,0,6-Apr-14,A115VO3YBPMTFA,They work...,"Just didn't like these, they work just require a lot of maintenance for something that shouldn't&#8230;don't be fooled they're kinda junky&#8230;the first time I washed them they made popping sounds for like 6 hours and upon inspection they small bamboo fibers were literally splitting into little hairs..kind of gross&#8230;you don't need the special oil they say you do, but medical grade mineral oil at your drug store or grocery&#8230;it's cheap and it does the same thing, I oil them about once a week. Honestly wish I had just sent them back."
6,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,6-Apr-14,A24A0POE60AVB9,Great,"Yes, just cutting boardsI love them.They are light and vary in size.Getting 3 is a convenience and they are at a good price.Now you can utilize multiples while cooking."
7,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,5-Apr-14,A1BU3A7C7BD31P,look nice,"Have had these cutting boards for several months. They look very nice, and we have not had any problems with them breaking or warping."
8,XX,B002M782UO,1,0,0,5-Apr-14,ATSLZ0D687OX,Don't waste your money!,"It did what it was suppose to until today. I used the middle sized board about 4 times and now its starting to split at the handle. Don't waste your money on this, I've only had this for about 6 weeks."
9,XX,B002M782UO,3,0,0,4-Apr-14,AQPAJ3T6IW5DZ,Good buy.,"A bit light, when attempting to cut on them they may slide. So be carful with how you are slicing. The smallest board slid right off the counter while attempting to slice a tomato. Good product for the price, just may not be the best for use as an actual cutting board."
10,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,7-Jan-14,A3886QUHLG56UH,cutting boards,There is nothing better in the kitchen then Bamboo cutting boards!!  They fit in the dishwasher if you want and clean up easy.  protects counters and keeps food safe.  Love these!!
11,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,7-Jan-14,A38ROKXMSZCCH7,Great set for my needs,I got this for under $10 and love it.  I had used the plastic boards for years and finally gave up on them after having to replace them so often.  I love these boards because they are hard but do not dull my knives.  One piece of advice is to buy some mineral oil at your local pharmacy (walgreens) and rub these boards with the oil as they do not come treated when purchased.
12,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,7-Jan-14,A1SRI09RYES35E,liked them,"I orginally bought these cutting boards because they were on sale but after using them, I would have paid full price. I especially enjoy the small cutting board as it doesn't take up much room and still gives you the ability to cut up veggies with ease."
13,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,7-Jan-14,A30Z64GON78HMV,Great cutting boards,This is a fine set of boards.  All 3 sizes are useful and they are thin so they leave very little footprint on my countertop when stored leaning against the wall.  Easy to clean.
14,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,7-Jan-14,A26DADU2ZQ6SGN,Best Little Cutting Boards In My Kitchen,"Besides the fact that these boards are from Totally Bamboo,  the different sizes and weights of these boards was the reason for buying this set.I had back surgery and could not get to my Totally Bamboo Malibu board and these just seemed to be a better choice right now and I am so glad I bought them. Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store"
15,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,6-Jan-14,AVVIJ7EBPS4EI,Great Environmental Cutting boards,"I really like these cutting boards. A year in of good use and they all look fine. They are easy to clean and I cannot notice any stains on any of them yet. I haven't treated them or used the recommended maintenance and they're still doing well.I have never used these for meat and would be concerned about doing so with such a porous surface, but for veggies and bread these are perfect."
16,XX,B002M782UO,1,0,0,6-Jan-14,AWMG4K2NDNCP8,Need Bamboo Oil?,"These arrived and were smaller than expected.  I measured mine and thought they were about the same, but with the hand hold taken out they are really small.  Also had instructions to soak with bamboo oil.  Who has bamboo oil sitting around?  My wife gave them away before I found out where to get bamboo oil."
17,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,5-Jan-14,A1FOXAXSU02MPO,Best cutting boards,"We have tried many others, but these are the best by far. They last for years and look like new even after heavy use. They don't warp or splinter."

19,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,3-Jan-14,AJIHYOGV46FEY,Love these,Really nice boards.  Light weight and easy to clean and stay nice looking. I would recommend these to anyone. .
20,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,3-Jan-14,A2KZE2TPQ1QO0S,"So far, so good!","I have only used these cutting boards a couple of times, but so far they have held up very well.  They're easy to clean, easy to store and they look really nice.  They are sturdy and provide a nice, flat cutting surface."
21,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,3-Jan-14,A3NYHH6I8C28F8,Great Product!,I was looking and looking everyday for a Lightning Deal that I could get and then these popped up at a great price so I couldn't pass it up. I bought and received them very quickly and they're awesome! I can't wait to get some use out of them!
22,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,2-Jan-14,A27RL8MHMINRIW,the best I ever had,"I ordered a set like this for myself last year,,,loved them so much I got my son and daughter-in-law a set for Christmas!  Their eyes lit up!"
23,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,2-Jan-14,A3RXPJZSGYRTCM,Great cutting boards,"Excellent sizes for everyday use and I love the small one for serving. Bamboo so they're cheap, renewable, and water friendly (more so than most wood, anyway).I have 2 sets and use em both all the time."
24,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,2-Jan-14,A3L6Q3MKETJJY0,Great Christmas Gift,Nice and easy to clean.  Very light and easy to handle.  Like the various sizes for different uses.  Came as described.
25,XX,B002M782UO,1,0,0,1-Jan-14,A2INT1M847U0NN,cute but,"gave it as a gift  mom said it was cute but thinner than expected, she cant use it and that directions said she needed bamboo oil - She cant be bothered &#34;with all that&#34; - As soon as I get it from her I plan to return it  - Hopefully the seller can refund - -I will repost later"
26,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,1-Jan-14,A31Q53JB9GJE5T,Love it!,My daughter is moving out and these are great starters for my daughter and you can't beat the price! Value!
27,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,31-Dec-13,AMDURHPYNYQU5,Great Gift For My Mom!,"These shipped fast as always from Amazon.  Purchased these for my mom who has some arthritis in her hands so I was trying to get something durable, not too heavy and still looks nice on the counter.  This really fit the bill and she really likes them!"
28,XX,B002M782UO,3,0,0,31-Dec-13,A2W0N9ZERSQC44,Have held up well,These cutting boards have held up well for the last year.  Only complaint is the continue to have a glue smell.
29,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,28-Dec-13,A1W0704CQHA7AI,Very durable and you can't beat the price!,"I bought these as a Christmas present for my sister. Our father is a five star chef who cooks all over the world. We grew up in a very nice restaurant learning how to cook from a very young age. Cutting boards have always been a fun thing to buy, and very worth spending large amounts of money on for the larger blocks we traditionally use. However, so many times when we are making finger dinners (cheese, nuts, olives, onions, hot sauce, crackers, etc...) we don't want to use the block boards. Having these three lightweight and very durable boards have been VERY handy and easy to clean and store. Also easy to grab for a quick platter. Very nice cutting boards."
30,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,25-Dec-13,AALTRDVGZ7IQI,nice,"I bought these for my mom, and they are great.  they are about 3/8&#34; thick, so not heavy at all."
31,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,22-Dec-13,A1MPX8JVJONXV7,Great cutting boards~,"They are heavy duty, without being bulky. Very smooth and nice made. The small one in the pack is perfect for sitting pots on."
32,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,19-Dec-13,A1FL1QMKTLA92Q,Totally Bamboo 3-pc Cutting Board Set,I gave them to my stepdaughter for a present last year.  She loves them and uses them all the time.
33,XX,B002M782UO,4,0,0,17-Dec-13,A24TKDOPSNGP4U,Product was broken,"This could be from a combination of things. The item arrived with broken handles. Unfortunately some shipping companies throw boxes on the ground, perhaps bubble wrap may have kept this in tact. It looks like a great item, but I chose a refund as this was an anticipated gift."
34,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,17-Dec-13,A1QD92DIRX6WIN,Nice cutting boards,"These are nice, quick to grab boards for small cutting jobs in the kitchen. Their size and variety allow you to avoid cross contamination issues."
35,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,14-Dec-13,A3A45ANCZ4KWRR,Beautiful,I bought these cutting boards because they were discounted and I needed some for my new apartment. I think these are lovely. It is quite useful that they come in a set of three and they are pretty enough to store in sight in the kitchen.
37,XX,B002M782UO,2,0,2,12-Dec-13,A1CYT5VSN4XCXF,Cheap and made cheap,"Pros:1. Cheap2. Good size (It came with large, medium and small)Cons:1. You would find lots of bamboo debris after dashwashing."
38,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,11-Dec-13,A1AGOQTZCT029D,Will last a good while if properly maintained.,"This is my third time purchasing this product. I got it at a great price for cyber monday ($9.99). The product lasts a while if you hand wash it. If you put it in the dishwasher make sure that rub the wood with olive oil every fifth wash otherwise it tends to warp and then crack in  half. Especially the largest of the three boards, I have never had the small one break on me though, Its always the largest one that goes first then the medium one."
39,XX,B002M782UO,4,1,1,10-Dec-13,A29CJR2LAN3LJ0,Quality product,This product is really great.This is a really inexpensive product that allows you to have a classy looking bamboo cutting board set. This item appears sturdy so far.My one complaint is that other reviewers are correct in that the handle is a bit rough. As one reviewer suggested I may try to rub some oils into the product to soften it.For the price I don't think you can go wrong. This was a lovely product.
40,XX,B002M782UO,1,0,0,9-Dec-13,A7CV9IW821SNI,Waste of money,These cutting boards fell apart at the joints in the handles within a week. I bought a set for us and a set as a gift. Thank goodness I had the chance to try them out first. I'll be returning the set I intended as a gift.
41,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,7-Dec-13,A3NYN9V6W1S9TM,Great Cutting Board,ordered this product twice now! One for me and one for a friend! We both love the product and would buy them again!
42,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,6-Dec-13,A2HBQEJSDN9PR5,thumbs up,I have had these for a few years now and they are only just showing signs of real wear- and I use them all the time! I would happily get another set!
43,XX,B002M782UO,1,0,0,5-Dec-13,ARDVHTCK7WNN8,Poor quality,"I Bought these boards as part amazon lightinig deals. First of all they are relatively small. So if you need a lot of cutting avoid them, I used them for about 4 months total until the big board started breaking down from the joints. Very poor craftsmanship. Avoid"
44,XX,B002M782UO,1,0,0,5-Dec-13,A33E0P4SH55OL,Came warped out of the box,"Super disappointed.  I bought these as a lightning deal last year, and all three came shipped to me already warped. I would have returned them if I did not have to pay for shipping."
45,XX,B002M782UO,2,0,0,5-Dec-13,A3S1SG40YEJHOC,Not everlasting,"These did not last as long as other cutting boards I've had, they eventually became warped. It is nice to have various sizes, though."
46,XX,B002M782UO,3,1,1,4-Dec-13,ACAXV4V8PBCE3,Difficult to cut on,"I bought these because they were bamboo and I had read that using bamboo was good for the environment. These are light and easy to pick up and move around, stay flat/do not warp, but the grain of the bamboo makes them hard to cut on. The surface has just enough ridging to it that it slows down cutting. I prefer a smooth surface where I am not having to fight  to get things cut.I will eventually get rid of these for plastic or some other wood cutting surface that is smoother."
47,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,4-Dec-13,A3LBXTBTG5QE1,"good product, no headaches","I haven't had any problems with these boards and with the abuse they took during our garden season i expected some. I would buy them again, if i ever need too."
48,XX,B002M782UO,1,1,1,3-Dec-13,A2KUK56V5DNZ4X,Poor quality.  Not as described.,"This was one of the worst purchases online.  The cutting boards are grainy, and do hold scents.  It does not provide a smooth cutting surface.  Would not give refund!"
49,XX,B002M782UO,2,0,0,2-Dec-13,A1UFPK8HW2L74Q,Broken in few months,It is broken in few months. All the cuting board got crack in center. Better buy some good cutting board
50,XX,B002M782UO,1,3,3,30-Nov-13,A256FWIURNFGRX,"Pretty, but useless","The cutting boards are very pretty, but functionally useless. The bamboo is untreated, so it peels immediately. As soon as I washed them, they started shedding these little hair-like fibers. It's a shame, since they're a great assortment of sizes and very solid. Unfortunately, they're just not very good quality. I returned them immediately, and would advise against buying them. Spend the extra few bucks and get something better."
51,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,29-Nov-13,A1HSQ0TC3PEOEK,Bamboo boards,"I love these cutting boards and use them every day for cutting a variety of things: bread, meats, cheeses, veggies, fruits.  For example, the small size is perfect for lemons and limes, and the big one works well for chopping kale and other leafy greens."
52,XX,B002M782UO,1,0,0,26-Nov-13,A3I43PYBXWCKNW,Unimpressed...returned for a refund!,"Very poor quality and not very big at all...flimsy and cheap feeling, and rough surface, not smooth...would not recommend! I purchased these because my Kyocera knives cannot be used on any surface except wood or rubber type surfaces, but these are terrible!"
53,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,24-Nov-13,A4LUWNUOR4DDT,"Finally, a bamboo cutting board that doesn't warp or crack (after 5 months)","I love bamboo cutting boards - they look awesome, they don't tend to dull knife blades as bad as some other hard woods, and they are easy to clean (they don't seem to stain as easily as others I've used).I like the three sizes of this set. The smallest, is really too small for any cutting I could think of, but it works well as a small cheese board. The thickness of these is perfect for me. The are light and easy to handle, but just thick enough that I don't think they are going to break anytime soon.After 5 months of frequent use, they haven't warped, split, or broken in any way (that is typically one problem that I have seen with some bamboo cutting boards - these don't seem to have that issue though). One recommendation with these (or any wood cutting board) would be to oil it with either a cutting board oil product (I use &#34;Butcher's Block&#34;) or just mineral oil (much cheaper, and I've heard, just as effective). It can really extend the life of your boards. I tend to get lazy after a few applications, but even 2-3 seems to make a world of difference in reducing warping and cracking of a cutting board.Definitely going to buy from &#34;Totally Bamboo&#34; again."
54,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,20-Nov-13,A1YAYINHENFZ7D,Perfect,"Very pretty wood, very usable sizes, smallest would work to serve fruit cheese and crackers for a small group. You can feel the grain."
55,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,18-Nov-13,A36PCFM0B780D2,Nice looking; useful and handy sizes,Nice looking cutting board set in handy and useful sizes.  I bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law to go along with a kitchen knife set we bought for her.
56,XX,B002M782UO,1,0,0,15-Nov-13,A2TXUFDN8R1M6B,nice set but will break,the wood peels and because it is bamboo it will split completely once there is a break somewhere on it.
57,XX,B002M782UO,1,0,0,14-Nov-13,A195OX02RPBBPE,Don't waste your money,These are junk...I have had then for 2 weeks...the largest board is broken at the handle and warped.  The other 2 are discolored and beginning to warp.  I wish I would have invested in higher quality.
58,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,13-Nov-13,A31DUP99BVTPNL,These boards are beautiful and practicall indestructible. Very useful,"The small piece is an ideal everyday cutting board, cheese board and food tray. The middlel-sized board is ideal for large foods. The large board serves in my shop as a cutting board for thick leather cutting."
59,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,9-Nov-13,A3QG3A7OQ3KLQG,Very durable and attractive.,"Love these cutting boards.  They are so attractive and durable.  The sizes are quite useful.  I hang up the two larger ones, the small one drops easily into a drawer.  I have used them for several months and you cannot even tell they have been used.  Very durable!"
60,XX,B002M782UO,3,1,1,6-Nov-13,A51O22M4A3DY6,Dry Wood,"The boards themselves are fine but they weren't very well conditioned. When they arrived, the wood was really dry around the handles. It's nothing a little mineral oil and beeswax won't fix but I can't imagine that they would hold up very well without being treated."

62,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,3-Nov-13,AMBJJUSCRE153,Best cutting boards ever!,This are excellent cutting boards and have held up exceptionally well.  The hard bamboo hasn't shown signs of even the slightest scratch and they've been very easy to clean.  I wouldn't be surprised if they also have anti-microbial qualities to them.  These are probably the best cutting boards we've ever owned!  These boards were well worth the purchase price which was very reasonable.
63,XX,B002M782UO,2,0,0,29-Oct-13,A2YT2TNJIT9LL0,"Smaller than expected, already cracked and food sticks to them",Although size specifications were posted they were smaller than I had expected. One of them has already begun to crack and food has a tendency to stick to them. Stick with plastic or hardwood.

69,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,6-Oct-13,A26U5LJIFKU06Y,Eccellent Small Cutting Boards,I have several very nice large cutting boards in my kitchen but since I will be 90 years old next April I do not always want to walk the approximately sixty feet from my bedroom to my kitchen to use one of those boards.  These small very excellent quality cutting boards serve me very well in my bedroom where I have a table and eat most of my meals.
70,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,2-Oct-13,AAFGKZONM97UP,they work great at a great price,"they are great for what they are (small cutting boards). have been using them for over 6 months now and haven't had a problem, and for the price if they only last a year i don't much mind. i don't use the smallest one for much of anything, but that is ok. be sure to oil them with mineral oil or another oil you like once a week for a month when you first get them, then just oil it once a month after that. towl them dry when you clean them and store them in a vertical position. they are thin and i bet they would warp pretty easily if you didn't take care. (and when you oil them you don't need much oil, just a drop or three)."
71,XX,B002M782UO,3,1,1,30-Sep-13,A1MQ7OV7OTUOSD,Has splinters coming out,"This bamboo cutting board set is very useful and handy.  I love it.  The only bad thing is that after the first use, it continues to shed tiny splinters.  I am sort of afraid it might be stuck to food that I cut.  I don't think this cutting board is great for its quality."

75,XX,B002M782UO,3,1,1,19-Sep-13,A2V4OPO9LDC8TR,Many mixed pieces,"Im worried it is not very strong, so im taking it extra slow and easy on these.  I wished I had gotten the one with the little grooves on it do the liquid didn't run off the board to the counter top."
76,XX,B002M782UO,1,1,1,18-Sep-13,A2ZTS4D78D8PLO,Inferior quality,"If you wanted quality, look elsewhere. Even with oiling, these thin boards didn't hold up well at all.The best one I've found thus far is a pressed composite board that is very dense and has held up beautifully. If I can find the link I will add it."
77,XX,B002M782UO,1,2,2,17-Sep-13,A2TT6R7C3C4VXI,Very disappointed in these boards,"These boards are about half the thickness of other bamboo boards I have.  They were so lightweight, they slid around on my quartz countertops.  The small board is so small it is unusable -- except maybe for slicing a lemon or a lime.The fault was not Amazon's, it lies with the manufacturer.  I am returning these boards."
78,XX,B002M782UO,1,1,1,12-Sep-13,A2Z7MZP0YSOXFA,not worth the material used to make them,These are great if you are only cutting 1 clove of garlic. They are extremely thin. You get what you pay for.
79,XX,B002M782UO,3,0,0,12-Sep-13,A8Y7WFWFYJTU1,Handle broke and boards warped after time,"They lasted a while and then the handle broke. Thankfully it didn't splinter. Not too sure why it broke because I never dropped it or hit anyone with it. Then after taking the peel off of some oranges, I let it sit in the sink for a day and it warped the board. Maybe wet the board on both sides before cutting things that are super juicy. Also don't let it sit with juice just on one side for the whole day like me."

I know that China is one of the sources of bamboo, but I was really hoping this product was from elsewhere...I really didn't want to sand and then oil treat my new cutting boards.  I don't mind oiling them, as I do with other wooden items I own, but having to finish the product is a little much."

The mid-sized one, which got the most use, badly warped after about 6 months, then completely split in half after about a year. I don't use the cutting boards all that much (maybe 6 times/week) and I always washed by hand in lukewarm water, and always let out to dry--they never sat in water. The little one just split in half today, hence the comment.They look nice at first, but again the quality is awful. If I have to coat them in mineral oil every month, what is the point? I'll just spend $20 more and get some olive wood cutting boards. Which is what I did.I did not have problems with splinters flaking into my food; it wore down a little after a year of use, but nothing I consider abnormal. The real problem was the warping and the splitting apart."

If something is required to use a product, it should be included with the product or made clear prior to purchase.The fibers come off in your food or when you try to wash it, and the smell is really bad.I'm going back to low upkeep plastic."

I really like them.Update: I have had this set for about 8 months now. These are my go to cutting boards in the kitchen. I like them but I should have taken better care of them. I put mine in the dishwasher and have never oiled them. I don't use the smallest one. It just sit in a drawer. It is so small I really don't have a need for it. The two larger ones I use have suffered damage. I believe it is from me putting them through the dishwasher. The large one has warped. The handle has snapped off of both of them. I like them but don't love them. But, they were cheap. It's one of those, you get what you pay for kinda things. If I had hand washed them; I would imagine they would be in better shape. But, once raw chicken touches something...in the dishwasher it goes. I would have to absolutely love something to take the time to hand wash. Not too sure I would buy again."

Although I still use the old one (with a channel around it when I'm carving something large and drippy), I typically reach for these little bamboo cutting boards now. They work so well for crackers and cheese, constructing a sandwich, carving an apple, and so forth. Consider that the set looks great at an informal cocktail party.

I would have liked for the biggest one to have a groove near the edge to hold the juice if I use it to cut or slice a pot roast or other piece of cooked and juicy meat.

She was ecstatic to replace her ancient 2'x3' inch thick boards she'd been using for years.  So you can imagine her disappointment when after two weeks of constant use they began to warp and crack.I have never used bamboo cutting boards before, so I was unaware of the care needed (oiling prior to use, maintenance oiling each month, no dishwasher, etc) because there was NOTHING included in the packaging that said so. I only realized the care requirements after looking back at recent reviews on Amazon to see if anyone else had this problem. So, of course, I never passed that knowledge on to her and now she has three ruined boards that she had to toss."

I did not apply mineral oil to them, just some olive oil - and they're holding up well. They're a bit thinner than expected, but that doesn't impact their performance.I will agree that the smallest cutting board is kind of confusing - I've used it to cut up carrots and salami for myself, but even for a single serving it is small.Overall, I would purchase again."

The set I bought is in a vacation home, so I really don't know how they'll stand up with regular use and washings.  Even so, for the price, you really can't go wrong with this set.  I would definitely recommend this bamboo cutting board set, whether you buy it for your own home or as a gift."

I like the smaller size to take out on the patio next to the grill and the larger ones when making dinner inside! It is easier to clean everything at the end of cooking instead of rinsing one board in between each time! I also like how they are lightweight and easy to store away!

This was a great addition to the home because they are light, durable, and have size options for what you need. I have not placed them in the dishwasher because I do not want them to get damaged by the heat. I hand wash them and it is just as easy to clean because it's a flat surface. I have not needed to oil them at all. I just received them washed them and started putting them to use. They are very handy and so far so good."

137,XX,B002M782UO,3,1,1,24-May-13,AU5003XM604YF,Not what I expected,"The boards are good quality, but when I got them they came with a note that I needed season the boards with mineral oil or some other special stuff that did not come with the boards. It wasn't a big setback, but definitely not what I was expecting. I did not end up seasoning them and they have worked fine, although I admittedly do not use them as frequently because after a year they have started to warp a tiny bit. Otherwise they dry really quickly after washing, which is a big plus for me."
138,XX,B002M782UO,2,1,1,23-May-13,A3FDGAY2F3ADOY,A good deal but not made to last,"I've had these for about 6 months and while they seemed nice at first, they have begun to warp and the handle piece has broken off on all three. They are still usable but not all that attractive anymore. It would have been nice if they had been made to be sturdier, I wouldn't be surprised if they start to split entirely in a few months. In the past I've had both wood a plastic cutting boards last for years and years so in comparison these do not seem worth the money, even if they are inexpensive."
139,XX,B002M782UO,2,1,1,22-May-13,A2S5HCT7Y09BU7,They look nice... but are fraying a lot.,I really liked these out of the package. After one use however they are fraying off pieces of bamboo. This concerns me because it is stained and the fragments are ending up in my food. If I could do it over I would spend more money on better quality.

148,XX,B002M782UO,2,0,0,6-May-13,ALNFHVS3SC4FV,Lacking in quality,"I bought this set during a lightning deal during Christmas time. I was very excited about this set because I got it for such a good deal but I guess the old saying is true that you get what you pay for.The sizes are on the smallish size but I like that. I wanted some small boards for just light chopping and slicing.The bamboo is attractive but one of the boards after just a few months of use, has started completely splitting in two at one of the wood strips in the middle of the board. I am familiar with bamboo care and have not abused this at all. I have never let it sit in water and have never put it in the dishwasher and still, it is completely splitting in two.The size and look is nice but disappointed that one has started cracking."

I've been using the boards everyday for a month and have had no problems.I found even the smallest size board useful (unlike some reviews) - it is a good size for slicing up an apple or orange.

153,XX,B002M782UO,4,0,0,26-Apr-13,AJWXTFR98IHP8,Affordable and effective,"These are nice cutting boards, especially for the value. They look great, are environmentally friendly and quite durable.Bamboo cutting boards are harder than most other woods and much harder than plastics, so they can be harder on your knives, but they show less wear. Even after heavy use these only have a few nicks.Remember to get some kind of wood oil and treat these first. It is very important to treat these cutting boards properly before using them. Once they are treated, you wont be disappointed.They do warp easily if stored upright, so try to find a flat place to store them. I store them underneath my pots rather than leaning against them like I would put a plastic board. They lose half a point for that and half a point for the finish. It's not rough, but it's obviously cheap."

However, after using them for about 3 months or so, the board warps considerably.  It will not longer stay flat on the table and wobbles.  Not only that, the bamboo surface has alot of splinters.  I can no longer use them due to the danger of rocking cutting boards, and having splinters going into my food (imaging eating the food and then have splinters stab your gum....)This happened to all 3 boards, so they all went into the trash can.  Guess I'll stick to either plastic or real hard wood boards instead of these cheaper bamboos."

When she received them, I suggested she treat them with some bamboo oil that I used for mine to ensure they would last longer.A few weeks ago, I went to her house with some friends for dinner, and I noticed the boards were starting to peel. There were little pieces of wood mixed in with the food she was cutting on them.I insisted on trashing them. I am very disappointed, and I do not recommend this product!"

Saw some reviews about bad wear or splintering with extended use, so waited to write my review until I could see for myself. Now, I DO season these with mineral oil, just like the enclosed instructions say to do. I did it when they were new, and I do it again every now and then, especially if they start to look dry at all. They are holding up very nicely. I don't see any unusual wear or splintering. We use these daily and I think they are great."

160,XX,B002M782UO,5,1,1,11-Apr-13,A2I6KBFBFIORH7,Very Nice Cutting Boards,"I bought these boards when Amazon offered them on sale. Our old boards were getting pretty rough, so the offer was timely. These boards are quite nice, exceeding our expectations. They are thin, but not too thin, light and very well made. They are made of laminated bamboo. This material is easier on knife edges than our previous plastic ones yet they are not easily scratched. They must be seasoned with a non-degrading oil, such as mineral oil (not a vegetable oil) before they are used and occasionally thereafter. They must not be cleaned in the dishwasher, but washed by hand with a non-caustic soap and warm water and dried with a dishtowel.They are somewhat more trouble to maintain than plastic or hardwood cutting boards. However, they should last a long time, be easier on our knives, and they are an attractive addition to our kitchen."

168,XX,B002M782UO,2,0,0,31-Mar-13,A3H0WPPP6LLKEK,"Lasted for about 6 months, then they split","We bought these as an affordable and environmental alternative to hardwood cutting boards. We researched how to care for cutting boards and followed those guides by only running warm water over the boards and oiling them regularly. Despite these efforts, the boards have since fallen apart. I am someone that tries to keep my environmental impact as low as I reasonably can, but having to replace these boards every six months is not very economical. Therefore, I cannot recommend these cutting boards unless you are simply buying as a first set, on a limited budget in or just coming out of university. Otherwise, invest in something a bit more expensive, in my opinion."

I wiped the boards down with some water and dried them off with a towel.  When I came back the next morning I noticed that the mid sized cutting board had bowed.  It wouldn't sit flat anymore and had a small crack in it.  I thought that was strange, so I just tried to push it back.  Well, that was a bad idea because the board split right into 2.The larger board is a little warped now as well, but don't get me wrong it is useable. The smaller one seem absolutely fine.I guess you aren't supposed to wipe these down?  Maybe I just didn't follow the instructions.  Some say theirs broke after 6 months, mine broke immediately.Careful folks you might want to get the oil, or this isn't the product you are looking for."

201,XX,B002M782UO,1,0,0,11-Feb-13,A32918SASHEJTD,Cracks and splinters,"These cutting boards seemed decent upon first opening, lightweight and seemingly sturdy.  However, after the first washing, they all split around the handle area and also at the bottom.  They did not split in half, or into unusual pieces, instead just showed visible splitting in the wood.  I assumed over time, the cracking in the wood grain would travel and break them completely into pieces, but never got that far with these boards.  After first use, the wood splintered where all the knife cuts were.  I wasn't doing any major hacking on these boards, simply cutting potatoes with a chef's knife.  Now, when I say splintered, I mean legitimately splintered, with tiny-sized slivers of wood sticking upright from the board.  Since that was after one use and I don't intend to worry about getting slivers in anything I prepare in the future, I ended up buying a different set of cutting boards.  I would NOT recommend this because really...cracking is one thing (annoying but I can deal with it)...slivers of wood in my food is a whole different unwanted ballgame.  Be cautious when using these boards if you already have a set."

I would kind of expect something so tedious to have been done as part of the manufacturing process.  The good news is that 2 months in, they look good and are a little dry, but usable.  Next time, I would probably shell out for a bamboo cutting board that didn't claim to require such extensive treatment.It's also possible that they don't need mineral oil but the company wants me to buy it from them, in which case I would still give them the same star rating for poor sportsmanship..."

First, I had to purchase mineral oil and use it on the boards a couple of times (the manufacturer recommends daily seasoning for a whole week!). Then, every time I use them, I need to pay extra-care not to leave any water on them for more than it's strictly necessary, which I do; I wash and towel them dry as soon as I'm done cutting, but it doesn't seem to be enough, the boards tend to warp nonetheless.In conclusion, better than plastic perhaps, but not ideal."

However, it is really hard to complain about a product like this because it hard to find faults in cutting board.  Love the look and having mutiple cutting boards that are in different sizes is a big bonus. I never thought having 3 would be important but it is awesome.  Great Buy!!!"
232,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,25-Jan-13,AQCD1307TM93R,Great value,"I purchased this set of bamboo cutting boards for much less than what they cost at the local home-goods store.  I was very impressed with my purchase.  The three sizes are great for different purposes. We use the small one to put hot pots under when we want to put them on the table.  The larger two are great for cutting, and I've found that they're much easier to cut on than the plastic cutting boards.  The wood is attractive, strong, and serves the purpose.  One tip--I'd be careful with washing them, and preferably hand wash instead of putting them in the dishwasher.  They're a little delicate, and the finish gets a little bumpy with repeated wash."
233,XX,B002M782UO,4,0,0,24-Jan-13,A19W28UTP0AM0G,Good quality,"Received them and they are very good quality.  I would've like them to be a tab bigger but that's my fault for not looking at the measurements more closely.  One down fall is that they are not dishwasher safe, I hardly ever wash my dishes by hand."

The smallest cutting board is so small I use it to set hot dishes on, instead of a cutting board.  The price was right for the set."

However, despite hand washing only, the largest of the cutting boards started cracking and became warped in less than a month.  The only thing I can think of is that we cut tomatoes on there and then washed it off quickly and let it sit in the sink while we ate dinner.  We have owned several wooden cutting boards over the years and none of them suffered from either cracking or warping.  Maybe this is just a cheap piece of wood (the price WAS low).  Either way, it was a worthless product and we won't purchase any Totally Bamboo products ever again."

They have warped a little bit, but they are really healthy because you don't have to worry about getting that many bacteria within the grains when cutting on these. After a couple of years, the wood has started to fray a little and i guess you could say little splinters have begun to show, but you can easily pull these off and don't hurt that much on the board."

295,XX,B002M782UO,1,0,0,24-Dec-12,A35799T1VQW6UO,poor quality,These are paper thin cutting boards--and small. Even the largest board is fairly useless for cutting vegetables. The boards also have lots of splinters coming out and you do need to oil them before the first use. These are good if you just want to use them to put out cheese and crackers or fruit for parties but they are not functional for actually cutting work. Skip and save your money. I bought them on sale and will use them as my temporary bread board until they are completely destroyed.

321,XX,B002M782UO,4,0,0,2-Dec-12,A19BULUOHYRDYQ,Great gift for a person who is hard to buy for,"My mom mentioned to me earlier this year that she wanted a nice cutting board.  She has had a thick plastic one hanging in the pantry for years and over time it's become dingy looking. It has deep cuts in it, yellowing in the plastic from age and it's just icky to me.  She bleaches it after use but it just doesn't look great from all the years of service.  So this Christmas I picked up a set of these on a lightning deal and after inspecting them I am super happy I did. The boards are really nice.  The various sizes are fantastic. No more will she have to pull out a giant board just to chop a couple veggies.  You can hang all but the smallest one.  I'd rather if all could be hung without taking a drill to it.  My parents will have to decide if the want to blast a hole through it or toss it in a drawer. I suggest the drawer.  Don't know how they would stand up to being drilled. I never had bamboo boards before but have heard about them for years.  After seeing these, I'd buy a set for myself for sure based on looks alone. The boards look really nice on the counter top, much nicer than that old plastic board.  How easy it is to clean will be determined at a later date.  Since it's a gift I thought it may be rather rude to take them out for a drive. So my mom will have to let me know. Last but not least, actually the most important factor that led me to bamboo is my Dad.  He loves his kitchen knives.  He keeps them razor sharp and I have seen him admiring them on more than one occasion. So before even looking at any boards I did research and found that bamboo is supposed to be one of the best woods for chopping because it's easy on the blades.  Something my Mom will appreciate as well but not as much as my Dad.  So not only was the price right I think these boards will fulfill all what my parents or anyone could want out of a simple chopping board.  Style and function at a great price even when it's not on sale."

323,XX,B002M782UO,2,1,1,29-Nov-12,A247DD28851RE6,only lasted a month or two,My wife was really excited when these arrived. Unfortunately where we live it is very humid and these cutting boards got all moldy and mildewy. We ended up throwing them all away and switching back to the regular plastic cutting boards. Maybe these will work for you if you live in a drier climate.
324,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,28-Nov-12,A19HT7YC1UW3D6,Great Product,After using these for a while.  My family loves them.  Now i do not have to take out the big cutting boards from our kitchen to cut a small vegetable.

326,XX,B002M782UO,2,0,0,23-Nov-12,AWMUWTJLAN69I,3-piece set is now a 4-piece set,"I bought this set last year.  Now one of them has split in half-because they are too thin!  They have also warped-probably why one split.  The smaller one's are nice and convenient, but the larger one split.  In reference to what other people are saying about using mineral oil and 'babying' your cutting boards-I totally disagree.  I have owned a 3/4' thick bamboo cutting board for at least 5 years, have never put anything on it, and it has worked flawlessly and it looks like it has hardly been used.  I use it on a daily basis with very sharp knives (can't stand the dull one's) and it has never batted an eye and not worked perfectly.  Here's your clue: you don't see a profile picture of the cutting boards demonstrating their thickness in the item photos do you?!?!  I'd skip them, spend a couple dollars on a thicker one that can do everything, clean up perfectly and then tackle the next item you throw at it."
327,XX,B002M782UO,2,0,0,23-Nov-12,A16P34Z9STF27G,"Not great, just barely ok","These were given as a wedding present. The handles are completely useless and take away from valuable cutting real estate/surface area.  They warp quite easily even though we have washed them and wiped them down to air dry vertically after every use.  We oil them every couple weeks, but they've started splitting apart. Best spend your money on a hardwood, end cut, butcher block and avoid this 'green' board set."
328,XX,B002M782UO,5,1,1,23-Nov-12,AXQO8S7XL46Z2,Excellent.,"I really like these cutting boards. I've had them about a year and they still look brand new. Of course, I never put them in the dishwasher which I don't like but it only takes a couple of seconds to clean them off. The small one is a pretty useless size and I recently put it in our 'goodwill' pile."

You need to put mineral oil on this type of wood cutting board and season it for it to stay in good shape.  I use a plastic cutting board that I can put in the dishwasher for cutting meat and use the wooden bamboo ones for cutting veggies and breads.  These smaller boards are just the ticket for smaller needs.  Highly recommended!
331,XX,B002M782UO,1,0,0,7-Mar-14,AJ86ZXSFZZZX4,Less than 60 days and it breaks,"I bought these with high hopes, I treated with oil to condition and keep in good condition. We hand washed the boards when dirty and here we are less than 60 days after purchase and the wood is cracking and chunks are falling out. The handle has broken out of two of boards. Clean cracks along the seams, just fell out."

333,XX,B002M782UO,2,0,0,5-Mar-14,ACVROWWR1TYL4,Wish I would have read the reviews about curing the wood before using,"After hand washing these boards once, before use, they began to shed hundreds of tiny wood splinters.  I tried wiping away the splinters with a cloth, with a sponge, with water, with my hand, etc.  All I got was a handful of splinters.  I decided immediately that there was no way I was going to cut or prepare food on these boards, so I packaged them back up to return.  I WISH that I would have read the reviews on here that mention a need for curing the boards with oil before using them, but I checked the packaging they arrived in, and there were absolutely no instructions at all.  Maybe this is common knowledge, but I sure didn't know I was supposed to do that.  I'm a staunch instruction reader and follower, and when I opened these, there were none to follow!  This seems a bit careless on the manufacturer's part, as if you do NOT cure the cuttings boards, your food will be full of wood splinters!  Unfortunately I can't really comment on the quality of this product, because I was not able to use it."
334,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,3-Mar-14,A3V7PUAJZ873PX,Very nice!,The three sizes are perfect!  They are of good quality too.  They're really pretty!  I would definitely recommend!  Better than I expected!

337,XX,B002M782UO,4,0,0,26-Feb-14,A1JL70MSIVVLXU,"Sturdy, light, and a joy to use.","When these arrived I was concerned with the thinness of the product. They are about 3/8&#34; thick and made of two thinner layers of bamboo. Time will tell how well they hold up but so far they are a joy to use. I oiled them thoroughly as directed and have been using them for about a month. The different sizes are well suited to tasks around the kitchen and the light weight makes them easy to use and store. They clean easily with just a small amount of soup and warm water.The only shortcoming was the roughness around the edges and especially inside the handles. The manufacturer should do a better job of sanding these surfaces. I got a sliver in a finger when I first used them and decided to sand the surfaces my self. In spite of that one flaw, I would recommend this cutting board set to others."

They haven't warped at all.  Very flat, efficient, and perfect 3 sizes for my house.  Had I been thoughtful at all, they would still be perfect."

341,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,31-Oct-12,A34DL0SYAPR63D,very happy with them,Great cutting boards.  They're thin so they don't take up much space but thick enough to feel durable.  I keep them oiled and they look great.  I didn't check stores for a similar product so I can't say whether they're priced well on Amazon.  But they definitely seem like a good deal for $20.
342,XX,B002M782UO,3,0,0,28-Sep-12,A15ILJJDBMT3Y4,just ok.,"I like the three different sizes - the small one comes especially in handy. But the finish is... odd. They feel almost brittle. I have had them for three months & hand wash them only, and haven't had any issue with breakage or disfigurement, so I can't really complain too terribly much. But I do have a far nicer one (that I spent quite a bit more on) from BB&B."

There are three boards of different sizes.  They are well constructed and solid.  They have a smooth finish and nice rounded edges.  As they are made from bamboo they are an environmentally responsible product.  My wife likes them so well she wants me to get her a set now.

(I guess I should invest in some).  Anyways, I received these boards and loved the price for three different sized ones.  On the other hand, I disliked that they would shred on me after using them and washing them off.  It only happened to one of the ones that I used, so it is not too much of a deal breaker."

I have the mid-sized board hung on the wall, and the small one displayed in the space between the burners on my cook top...they both look great and add style to the kitchen overall. I eat very little meat so I can only speak to how well they work to cut veggies & bread. I've also been using them to sit hot pans on and it hasn't seemed to damage them in the least."

367,XX,B002M782UO,4,2,2,25-Apr-12,A2OADM2SJZKY0K,"Like them, handle cut out limits space","So far I've enjoyed my cutting board set. I like that I have different sizes so if I have a small job, which I usually do, I can just grab the mini and rinse without a lot of fuss.They're attractive and wipe well. Although, I did notice I had to pull the scrubber out after I chopped strawberries because the strawberry juice started to soak into the wood. If I didn't attend to it right away I could foresee it staining. I was under the impression there was a coating to prevent that from happening, but I guess not.Lastly just wanted to point out that although it clearly has handles in the board, just understand that means you really aren't getting the full dimension of the board. So if you were planning to use this for the dimensions described (like rolling out dough or something)you won't have the full capacity due to the handle.I love that they are slimmer than most wood boards so they're easy to use and tuck away again.Overall I'm satisfied with this purchase."
368,XX,B002M782UO,3,1,1,23-Apr-12,A3BONKBH1O53JY,Not too bad,"When i got these i was hoping they would be a little bigger in size, and wider. but it's OK.the small cutting board is pretty tiny :/ and they are seriously smaller than what i thought they'd be."

373,XX,B002M782UO,2,3,3,30-Mar-12,A31LQKKE5IOGX8,"Though not alot of money, IMHO: still not worth it","So, I saw the two piece set for $10 or so, we used plastic cutting boards before, this seemed better than what was at Target, so I gave it a shot and bought them in April '11.. I really really tried, I even got the mineral oil and made sure they were not in the dishwasher (which we did with the other boards).. but now, 4 months after buying them, they look decades old. They are scratched and warped. They still work, they are fine, but I was expecting better. The warp on the big one is annoyingI did the oil thing like 4 times (rub mineral oil on them, both sides, and let them sit overnight), I was expecting a lot better performance, I don't want to have to oil them every month. Maybe for $10 I should have lowered my expectations...For the record, no smell, not flaking or pealing, but this does not seem like bamboo is 'harder than maple'... I keep my hugging to other trees.UPDATE (8/11): I threw out the smaller one, it was too warped to be any good. I bought some of the plastic ones cutting boards as replacements. It was an interesting bamboo experiment, but in the end I am back to those white plastic cutting boards, I can put THOSE in the dishwasher.  anyone want a half bottle of wood oil?***********One-Year Update**************I don't have them any more. 6 months ago, I tossed the small one, some time in the last 6 months the bigger one was deemed worthless.so: in summary: if you want to put a lot of effort into oiling the boards, and keeping them safe from danger (dishwasher), and are ok if they only last a year or less.. they are fine, but that was not what I was looking for."

I didn't expect them to be that great considering the price, but with all the positive reviews, I thought, why not. Sometimes you get lucky. Now that I've used them, I can't understand the positive reviews except to say they are probably by people who don't know cutting boards and maybe don't cook that much. I studied cooking under a prominent chef years ago, and having used a great deal of boards, I know quality. Trust me, this isn't it.I bought these to be a portable, easier to clean alternative to my big, heavy block cutting boards. I had some TruBamboo boards I used to use for this purpose, but they were appropriated by my brother when he moved out of my home after an extended visit. Instead of spending a bit more money and replacing them, I thought I would try these.I was very disappointed. They are very small, very thin, and basically just flimsy. I know the measurements are included and I didn't expect them to be bigger than is stated, but somehow they just seem even smaller when you see how thin they are. I had one crack on me after the first two weeks of light use. Also, even though I oiled them every day for one week before use (as you should do with all wooden boards), they splintered and faded after the first use and hand wash. It just seems like the particular bamboo used in these boards will not take the oil. Or maybe it's something about the type of adhesive they use, or they way they are cured. Whatever the reason, these boards simply do not improve as a result of oiling the way my old TruBamboo boards did.I intend to use these until they finish falling apart and then go back to the TruBamboo. By the look of things, it will not be long."

Even with hand-washing, they started to look worn after about 3 months.  Now, after less than 6 months of use, the large one split apart and the medium one looks like it will split soon.Otherwise, I found the 'handle' to get in the way and food kept falling in the gap.  Wasn't too much of a problem though, I guess."

378,XX,B002M782UO,2,1,2,13-Mar-12,A1LDI7JUL7O9IV,high maintenance,"We bought these about a year ago because they were reasonably priced and good texture for the knives, and we like to have more than 1 cutting board of course. We did not read the instructions, and apparently were not supposed to put them in the dishwasher. The dishwasher is typically the best way to wash dishes because of the ease and safety (super hot water sanitizes). However, the dishwasher might be what ruined our boards. They split in the direction of the wood grain. Given the grain, I don't see why anyone would be able to sufficiently hand/sponge wash these boards. Guess we're going back to plastic! I give it 2 stars because the wood did not appear splintery, so I guess these boards would work if you were very careful with washing them."

382,XX,B002M782UO,4,0,0,4-Mar-12,A3HPPR5X2EUQII,Bamboo Boards,"These cutting boards function well for a good price.  Take a while to dry because the water really seems to seep in to the bamboo.  Also there were lines in the wood where knives had been used after only a few uses.  I have no big complaints about this product thought, I'm really happy to have them."
383,XX,B002M782UO,2,0,0,27-Feb-12,A1203DVVPQOOUG,Wished they last longer,We received these as a wedding gift and we loved them at first.  But they began to bend after being hand washed and dried.  Then they began to split and break apart entirely.  I wished they had lasted longer.
384,XX,B002M782UO,4,1,1,25-Feb-12,A3OSOMXF72UX4W,Nice Cutting Boards,"I bought these cutting boards to augment my collection a bit.  I wanted some versatility with regard to cutting surfaces and size.  I purchased them a little less than a year ago and thus far they have performed wonderfully.  The cutting surface is solid and they clean up nicely.  Nothing has cracked or frayed, but then I don't use them every day and I hand wash my cutting boards as opposed to placing them in the dishwasher.  Usually, washing cutting boards in the dish washer will put significant wear and tear on a set of bamboo cutting boards.  If I had to boil down these boards greatest strengths, it is price and utility.  Shortcomings, the smallest board is not overly useful; I may have used it once or twice.  Due to its size it is difficult to work with - namely just keeping the items that you are cutting on the board itself.  However, I am sure it could be used very effectively as a cheese board or something similar.  Regardless, I have been very happy with this set of cutting boards and give them a four-star recommend."
385,XX,B002M782UO,2,0,1,19-Feb-12,A29XLA3Q3VWRJD,"You know, these really aren't very good.","We've had them for about a year now, and not only are they cracked (which can be forgiven, considering the possibility of improper care)- they feel splintery to the point that I'm uncomfortable cutting food on them because it feels like bits of wood may be getting into whatever I cut.  Not the best-case scenario for a cutting board."

389,XX,B002M782UO,5,1,1,7-Feb-12,A3ENM96L1QJYEZ,Excellent Cutting Boards,"I bought these cutting boards about a year ago. All three sizes have been useful for me from cutting small items to regular food prep. Applying mineral oil and keeping them out of the dishwasher has kept them looking like new.Well, almost new. I cut just fine on the boards, and there is hardly a mark on them. But a friend used them once and left all these knife gouges in one of them. I don't think someone was letting the knife do the work for them.The only bad experience I've had. I dropped one from about four feet high on to a ceramic tile floor. The medium-sized board split into 1/4-3/4 pieces along the grain. I threw out the 1/4 piece and still use the larger one, but it was a little heart-breaking. It's too bad they didn't design a 'cross-grain' band to keep that from happening. A 'gutter' around the edge of the largest one would have been nice, too. But I haven't seen better without a big jump in price.Overall, I think they are a great value and would very much recommend them to most people."

Also, on mine the handles cracked right off, but the whole board hasn't cracked. In the end, these are good for cheese and veggies, but bread, steak or similar knives need to be used on something else."

Wrong!My first hint was when I went to pick it up and got a splinter. I thought it very odd as I've used wooden cutting boards for many years and never gotten a splinter, but I thought it was just a freak thing, so I continued use.Yesterday on my cafe's opening day, by the time it had been washed for the third time, little hair-like splinters were sticking up all over the board! I was mortified because I couldn't help but wonder if they had been going into the food.Needless to say I'm NOT happy at all, and considering that from now on out, I'll be too busy to deal with returns, unsavory products, etc. I'll likely look for a solution somewhere other than Amazon."

401,XX,B002M782UO,4,1,1,19-Dec-11,A4CY48Y3PUTQ3,Bamboo Paradise,"I ordered the 2-board set, with some apprehension, because of the price.  When they were delivered, I was pleasantly surprised.  Because of the strength of bamboo, the boards did not have to be 3' thick.  They are light, but extremely strong.  Additionally, they are not as porous as the oak boards.  The largest board is not particularly big; but, it is big enough for my needs.  I prepared Thanksgiving dinner with their help.  I would highly recommend the set."

I rubbed them down with oil when I first got them and have used them several times since purchasing. I will update once they are a little older, but for now I think they are more than worth the cost. The small one is teeny, but to me is perfect for cheeses."

I wasn't sure if all the bacteria was getting removed during washes.Anyway, ever since I have been using these boards I have had no issues with feeling like I am cutting on a bacterial filled board. I clean them with soap, warm water and a lemon. Even after getting wet and cut up on they still look great.I love them and if they ever break, I will buy another set."

408,XX,B002M782UO,5,221,231,23-Nov-11,A14D4XQXOBBZ8A,care of cutting boards.,"I have a set of these cutting boards.  However most boards need proper care.  Never put them in the dishwasher.  I clean mine with a  qt size spray bottle with 1/2 teaspoon bleach in it. I spray the board then sprinkle my cheapest salt on the board and then scrub rinse with warm water and then dry well with a towel.  After dry once a week I wipe them down with food grade mineral oil on a cloth wash cloth.  Not to worry as they have mineral oil in every grocery store or drug store.  This will keep all of your cutting boards in good shape.  I use certain boards for meat and others for veggies.  I write with a marker on the side so I am never confused which is which.  They will last for years and years.  I have a board that was my Great Grandmothers that I use for veggies only and it still is a good board. I also have a board that I  use for making bread pizza dough an pastries.  This set I  use for fish and one for sandwiches, one for one meat. They say we should do this and that is why I bought this set.  Thinking of getting a few more sets to give as gifts. Hope this helps everyone."
409,XX,B002M782UO,4,8,8,19-Nov-11,A2QANV0ZY9SW75,Worth the Effort!,"I purchased these 2 months ago and am so glad I did!  I was nervous after reading the mixed reviews, and waited to write this until I'd owned and used them for awhile.  The boards come with instructions to oil them 3 times a week for the first month and weekly thereafter so the wood is seasoned.  Not having the suggested mineral oil, I used vegetable oil I had in the cabinet, and a light coating on all 3 boards took about 5 minutes.  Being busy, after the first week I only did it a couple of times a week, and after a couple of weeks that dropped to once a week and then maybe once every other week.  The boards are handy, sturdy, and a pleasure to use. I haven't seen a single problem other reviewers have mentioned. I don't have a dishwasher, so I just wash these off right after use, let them air dry, and put them away. I give a 4 star rating since they do require some special care initially and periodically.  Glad I bought them, if you're wanting to try bamboo boards I think these are good and well worth it."

The smallest one is a bit small for most things, but we have used it! Also, we do not put them in the dishwasher, as they are wood. So ours have held up to hand washing, also - wiping them down, making sure they are dry, NOT soaking them. I'd definitely buy them again."

But as I had read in many of the reviews for bamboo products; I had to purchase mineral oil from a local department store to pre-treat them before I used them. The mineral oil I purchased was just regular OTC stuff and it cost me $2.oo. Not a bad investment, sense I've also used it to restore my older cutting boards as well. I like these bamboo cutting boards because they are light weight. The sizes are conveinent; just right for my needs. I would recomend these, just remember to pre-treat them BEFORE you use them. (pre-treat with mineral oil 2x times before using and then (1)once a week for a month; then once a month there after) If you apply the mineral oil on a regular basis these boards should last you many years."
413,XX,B002M782UO,1,11,12,4-Nov-11,A26RPZT3RXDCBN,Not worth it,"These cutting boards curled the first time I washed them and every time after that. Soon after they started to split.  It is 3 months later and all I have left are bamboo stakes.  They worked well for cutting, but they can't handle washing.  NOT a good buy."
414,XX,B002M782UO,4,0,0,4-Nov-11,AWWGZJFOP2U79,Bamboo 3 piece cutting set,Totally satisfied with this product. Most impressed with the durability of the boards. They clean up well and do not compromise the cutting ability of the knife used.

Stupid bamboo crap. Everywhere. So much crappy crap.If I were a cutting board and smelled this crappy and made the things I helped cut taste as crappy as I smelled, I would freaking kill myself. However, this is not the case. But i do have the power to destroy my crappy cutting boards and pass this extremely useful information to future buyers.Ps. I only gave it 1 star because they made me.

I can't get ahold of anyone about the missing piece yet, because it's only been 4 or 5 days since the product came in, but I will get ahold of someone.  I don't want to have to return the item.

I washed it...and it shed worse. So I did some investigation. You have to cure the wood with mineral oil. When I say have to...I actually mean HAVE TO.  BEFORE USE and often for the first month. Monthly after that. Wood is better for knives, which is why I got them, but be prepared. Use the mineral oil on it....before you use it.Follow up: Over a year later...I've had these for over a year now. They are doing well and holding up well. The first month was a little bit of work...but you can tell when they are starting to dry out and need to be re-oiled, I don't find it to be very high maintenance. I researched and from what I discovered, mineral in the drugstore section is the same things as the expensive ones made for curing bamboo. So I buy the cheap stuff and it works just fine. Just be sure to not leave the board submersed in water(my daughter did that on accident and the board warped, after a couple months it dried out and flattened again), and wipe off the extra oil after curing it."

I placed non-skid buttons on the bottom and then spread the cutting boards strategically around kitchen. After a week, however, they developed a bow; not a minor warp, but a sharp flip up along the edges that gave each board, the largest one in particular, the appearance of a Boston whaler boat. I won't go so far as to say it's dangerous to slice and dice on a warped surface, but for sure doing so requires your full attention."

They're different from wooden boards (remember bamboo is from the grass family) and need to be treated differently. If left soaking in water, they will curl slightly. They will also split (along the grain) after extended use. Why do I recommend them? It's because they clean up quickly, they are thin and can be stacked and they'll last quite a long time. At the price point you can afford replacing them once in awhile."

436,XX,B002M782UO,4,3,3,2-Mar-11,AG6TX1ZJHLMO7,Can not beat the price,My wife has a bamboo cutting board from William & Sonoma and too say it was much more expensive than these three boards is an understatement.  My wife had been advising me that we need more cutting boards as it is easier and quicker for her to use several boards at a time.  I had low expectations for these boards and let me say that I was wrong there was nothing wrong with the boards at all.  However smallest board is really too small and not very practical but the larger size and the medium size get a reagular workout.  We have had the boards now for about 6 months and I have now just noticed they are not holding their shape as much as I would like but for the price I am going to replace them.  The boards are a little thinner than our more expensive boards but that does not effect cutting at all its just a statment on size.  My wife has already ordered a second set.
437,XX,B002M782UO,5,3,3,28-Feb-11,A3EFIHUH9MR1J6,Great product for the price,These are an incredible deal if you love to cook.  Bamboo is also resistant to warping (unlike the expensive Cherry cutting board we bought) and requires minimal maintenance (we wash ours with soap and don't oil it).  You also can't beat the price.
438,XX,B002M782UO,5,5,5,19-Feb-11,A2U6WZ2ZHFDI8T,Nice set,"The large one is good size for cutting up small veggies, them med one is great cheese size and the small one it great for small things like garlic."
439,XX,B002M782UO,4,2,3,3-Feb-11,A3NE9M7KTHN05F,You get what you buy for the price,"I don't think it's even up for argument based on how these cutting boards wouldn't stand the test of time because of their price. They will splinter when cut on and washed a few times (my personal experience as well as based on the reviews here), but I suppose this is normal. The splinters will not get in the way, as long as you're not abusive when using the boards. The two biggest boards are a basic size for cutting on, and the smallest is great for serving sliced fruits or sliced bread. After excessive use, pour a little olive oil and rub it into the grain to maintain its looks...no need for that 'special' oil that's a ridiculous price."
440,XX,B002M782UO,3,0,0,23-Feb-14,ACA4BDET55QRY,kinda flimsy,i've had this for less than a year and one of the boards has cracked.  i guess you get what you pay for.

442,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,23-Feb-14,A2IND7FIV0RQID,"Love these, Love Bamboo","Forget the expensive wood cutting boards, these are reasonably priced and durable. Just make sure to buy the right oil to keep them from warping. They are great for all needs, I can even get a frozen pizza on the largest board, it doesn't look that big but it is. I buy bamboo exclusively, it's inexpensive, strong and beautiful. Yes, buy this, it's a good buy."
443,XX,B002M782UO,4,0,0,21-Feb-14,A3VDYQU50UBPLA,Great Buy,These were a gift for a friend.  She loves them and raves about the convenience of 3 sizes.  The order was inexpensive and arrived early.
444,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,21-Feb-14,A1T01PAGN3CCOV,Love them.,"I was Christmas shopping and these came up on the Black Monday sale.  I had bought a set last year as a gift for my niece, at her request.  She seemed pleased, so I thought I would buy myself a set.  Perfect sizes.  I dislike large cutting boards as they are hard to wash.  And I don't like glass because of the noise.  So the only options I had were plastic or wooden.  Plastic gets cut/scratched up pretty quickly.  I was concerned that these might also and/or absorb smells.  So far they have been great and the only problem with smell I have had was garlic.  Washed it a couple of times and then just allowed to air for a day or so and it was fine."
445,XX,B002M782UO,3,0,0,20-Feb-14,A1SM5K7R7SNC8R,"Fine, but lightweight","These are fine, but lightweight. They are attractive, reasonably stable, lightweight, wash up easily, and haven't warped (so far at least). On the negative side, the largest is quite small, but worse, they scratch easily. My bread knife leaves quite visible gashes. I don't expect these to hold up very long, and whien I replace them, I will get something more substantial."

Also the surface on all 3 are rough now that they have gone through the dishwasher.  Maybe they aren't dishwasher safe.  If that's the case I never would have purchased them, I assume they are."

450,XX,B002M782UO,3,2,2,21-Jan-11,A1TL06JBB4DUCW,"Fine, but don't last too long","I've had these cutting boards for about a year now and they have started to crack. They were great when I only hand washed them and oiled them regularly, but after twice in the dishwasher they warped and began to crack. Also, they are light. It's probably a personal preference but I prefer a heavy cutting board over light ones (the light ones can move sometimes while you're cutting). And I agree with the other reviewers that the small one really is too small for most things."
451,XX,B002M782UO,3,15,16,4-Jan-11,A2NR0F5Z4P83RW,Doesn't hold up as well as expected,"I requested these for Christmas and was excited to get them.  Unfortunately after a few days of use for fruits and veggies they already show lots of wear.  I did not put in the dishwasher, just gave a quick rinse, patted dry with a towel and set in my drying rack to air dry.  Maybe it's the acid from the fruits and veggies that caused the splintering?"
452,XX,B002M782UO,5,4,4,21-Dec-10,A8K5XJSY49AN0,Wonderful!,"Despite not being made in France, I purchased these for my Francophone wife, who is a chef and insists that all things culinary are better from France or Italy. She has used them for months and says they are her favorite boards ever to use - light and easy to maintain. They won her over, and she is quite a stickler for quality in kitchen items. One of her sisters visiting us felt the same and bought a set before returning home. I do the dishes and find these both easier to clean and more long-lasting than standard wooden cutting boards."
453,XX,B002M782UO,2,6,7,18-Dec-10,APF9EHN2F2DGC,FIne while they lasted,"These cutting boards were pretty good. They don't have a lot of surface area, but for a small quick job, they work great. I don't really know why they have the hole for a handle. It just reduced the cutting area by 1/5. All three had warped and split within 6 months of use. These were never put in the dishwasher or treated to hot pans. Not a great investment, but they worked OK for the time they were in one piece."
454,XX,B002M782UO,3,2,2,1-Dec-10,A2K4EKJYG2OBAV,Thinner & smaller than I expected.,"I only actually received 2 cutting boards, not three. It looks the smallest was missing out of my set. Not really pleased with them, they're about half the thickness I would have expected and too small to do any serious chopping on."
455,XX,B002M782UO,4,2,2,1-Nov-10,A2FGNDZXA6YD4D,Good set,"I like them so far.  The only thing I've noticed is that especially at the beginning, I saw bamboo fiber that kept coming up with use...  I think we probably ate some of the bamboo...Other than that, the cutting boards are very light and thin, easy to use.  I've read some reviewers say that the smallest one is useless - I've used it quite a bit, actually, cutting an apple or serving bread on it."
456,XX,B002M782UO,4,2,2,22-Oct-10,A1CUGLS0XFHLXL,does the job,"these bamboo board works and does the job.  they are convenient, cheap, and useful.  the only con, is that when washing, little hair like pieces come off.  not a big deal since it's natural bamboo and small enough that it's not going to cause a splinter.  it's just annoying, and i think the result of any bambo product."

They are easy to clean and do not show knife cut wear easily. They are durable and lightweight. I am VERY pleased with this purchase and would recommend these cutting boards to anyone who has a need for light, durable cutting boards in several sizes and for a bargain price."

A little disappointed, but we'll have to see how the other two sizes hold up."
459,XX,B002M782UO,2,2,3,24-Sep-10,A366SKSB79ZYZG,Not very useful...,The handles on these boards take up way too much of the already way too small cutting space.  I plan on returning these boards as none of them are really useful.
460,XX,B002M782UO,4,0,0,20-Aug-10,A3V4KEEND5UU2F,good cutting boards,The Cutting boards are nice. I have put them in dishwasher multiple times and have not had any problems yet. I didn't think the little one was going to be large enough for anything but to my surprise its perfect for small stuff like cutting up berries for cereal.
461,XX,B002M782UO,5,7,8,9-Aug-10,A3OKRH09CXTDZ5,Nice,"Thinner than expected, but that just makes them lighter and easier to store. They look nice. I like the variety of sizes."

463,XX,B002M782UO,2,97,112,20-Jul-10,AOFIBMXVIVCJ6,Wished these would've lasted longer...,"We bought these and were pretty excited to get them. We are always cutting fresh vegtables and fruit and ended using these daily for a few days. We loved the handles and strudiness. However, after washing them a few times, they began to crack and spilt. Then they even deformed so they didn't lay flat. We ended up having to return them. I do agree with another customer review that the smallest cutting board is too small to really do anything with also."
464,XX,B002M782UO,3,10,12,8-Jun-10,A2YSPRESM13WXE,"Good boards, way too small","It's my fault that I have trouble perceiving size without seeing the product in person.  It's good I got these three boards for $10 or I would probably be upset.The boards are very light weight and so far they've been sturdy (3 months).  Their size is my only complaint.  I'm not sure if the smallest board will ever be used because it feels more like a toy than it does a cutting board.EDIT: The measurements given is accurate: 6 by 8 inches, 8-1/2 by 11 inches, and 9-1/2 by 13 inches. Measure it out and see it for yourself. I only ever use the two larger sizes and IMO they're both very small."
465,XX,B002M782UO,4,8,9,6-Jun-10,A35LT14WG5BX0T,Pretty good deal!,"I got these when they were on special for just under ten bucks, and I have to say it was a pretty good buy!  Though to be honest, the smallest is too small for any practical use.  I honestly don't even know why they make cutting boards THAT tiny.  Who wants to chop veggies or something else on a surface the size of a photograph?But overall, great product, definitely sturdy, easy to wash, and I expect that they will hold up through quite a lot of use."
466,XX,B002M782UO,5,8,10,7-May-10,AYAGACDBOXIYX,Nice Set,Bought this set because of unsliced bread bought at local store. They store in Kitchen drawer when needed. Bamboo is a nice hard serface to cut against. They clean up nice and reoiling retains the new look.
467,XX,B002M782UO,5,16,21,8-Dec-09,A262LRTZT0LK5Q,Great value,"Quality seems fine and three boards for the price can't be beat.  They're not huge, but perfectly usable."

470,XX,B002M782UO,5,0,0,8-Feb-14,A2NU88FUA3RJ3,Useful,"These are thin and as such, very useful in more ways that just as a cutting board.  We keep one next to the stove as a trivet - we have used another one on the table as a bread board.  They stow away easily.  I didn't get rid of my big cutting board but find that I use at least one of these daily."

Once I bought a huge round thick wooden board-very expensive I thought and it split down the middle partway after a fairly short time. After that it was useless since the food fell in the cracks. I did not take it back to the (fancy store) because I am not that kind of customer, but I was so disappointed. It is important with these wooden boards of any kind NOT to soak them in the sink.

It's just a cutting board.That being said, because it is made with bamboo, the surface isn't slippery when cutting - so I don't have to worry about losing a finger if the knife slips.

Mind you, it isn't as if I threw it violently over and over again against the wall or something, I used it to cut a few vegetables.  I thought maybe it was a fluke, but now (a couple months after purchase), the small one is breaking apart.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because they look very nice.  But I'd never buy them again, since they're terrible quality.I cook every day.  I suppose if you cook once or twice a year, this would be a lovely cutting board set for you.
