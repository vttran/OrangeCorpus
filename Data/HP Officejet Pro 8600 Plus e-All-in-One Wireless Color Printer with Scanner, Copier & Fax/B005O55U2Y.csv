2,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,0,0,10-Apr-14,A33FMNDH2M4SLV,Get this Printer!,"Disclaimer: I did not save money and bought this at Staples. Price here is pretty good.6 weeks ago, I cleaned house. 3 HP printers tossed out: none working, all between 6-10 years old. I was left with a 4 year old Lexmark with Wi-Fi. It was &#34;OK&#34; but not great. Hey, it worked [most of the time].2 weeks ago on a Thursday night at 8:50 PM my 16 yo son needed to print his homework, and the Lexmark was spewing Red [&#34;Cyan&#34;] everywhere. Broken. My wife said &#34;Get the HP 8600 Pro Plus&#34;. Why? She has 4 of them in her office, and the entire staff swears by it! [If my wife likes it, it must be a good printer.]Ran to Staples, got this, and by 11 PM had it working.It is sweet. Print is concise, colors are very good. I can print from my droid phone[!], and it has been perfect including the ability to scan to pdf, a must for me.They kill you on the ink [hello: they all do] and you MUST use HP ink cartridges [no more easy inky refills that I am aware]. We use XP, Vista, Win 7 and I have a Surface Pro 2 with Win 8.1 [no CD drive] and HP has all of the Drivers and software needed on their website for download. Nice...This printer is a workhorse and very intuitive. So far it has been the best printer purchase ever, and I've had quite a few.I like this...at least so far.",

It constantly gets &#34;paper jam&#34; errors yet when I remove the back, there is no evidence of a genuine paper jam. After I power cycle the printer, It feeds that piece of paper through (which it couldn't do if there was a real paper jam) and attempts to print on the next page before it too gets a paper jam error. After repeating this drill four or five times I sometimes actually get my printout. This printer is less than a year old. After researching this, I find that this is a widespread problem with this piece of junk and that HP has not owned up to it. DO NOT BUY THIS DEFECTIVE PRINTER!",

While it is wired to my computer and wireless to others in the house.  It as many limitations.  You cannot access much of the information from your computer monitor.  You have to do all the copying from the little screen and much of the faxing.  You can not use your computer at all for any copy jobs (AT ALL).  That all is one from the printers little touch screen and may take up to 5 or 6 touches to do a process.  You cannot view or access your fax log from your monitor - it all has to be done from the printer touch screen.  Now the instructions say that you can have your faxes save to you computer but, it have to be re-installed or set back up almost, on a daily bases. And it looses contact with my computer about twice a week so I have to turn it off and restart it Twice a week.  I figured that if I get the software updates from HP it might improve but it seem to make it worse.  I usually have to start over on the setup of all the functions.  Typical HP.",

Both were easy to set up for wireless printing (from Macs, iPads, and iPhones).  The best thing is that the ink cartridges are HUGE and seem to last forever (at least 2 - 3 months with our printing requirements).  We have had no serious mechanical or electronic issues.  The one warning:  Use HP ink cartridges.  Every time we tried to use an off-brand, or to substitute a re-filled cartridge, we had problems.  Small price to pay for reliability, I think.",
10,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,0,0,14-Feb-14,A1TBP61EFWCSQQ,great printer,Easy wireless setup. Not great for someone who isn't familiar with setting up wireless network components. Print quality is excellent and fast.,

HP quality and performance simply can't be beat.  Setup was quick and simple, and performance is exceptional across the board.  If the ink cartridges last as long as estimated--or anywhere near estimates--I'll be pleased as Punch.  This is the perfect all-in-one solution for the wireless home office.  Highly recommend!",

In spite of hours of efforts I haven't been able to install it on my network of 3 MACS - it works fine wirelessly with them - and a PC - where it doesn't. I've lost hours scouting the Web and the HP support pages without finding a solution. Stay away from this printer! Don't let yourself be fooled by the reviews as I have been.

After it was set up and I stopped by I printed from my Note II without a problem.  By printing on both sides saves you money on printing supplies,
15,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,0,0,11-Feb-14,AXZEF61AK22B5,Prints beautifully,"The only problem is that it sometimes fails to refresh the wireless connection; I have tried turning it off and on, but the only way to refresh seems to be to unplug it - which is not recommended by the manufacturer.Print quality is very good, it doesn't seem to drink ink like some printers - if not for the matter of the wireless, I'd rate it 5!",

19,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,0,0,10-Feb-14,A1C6ZVMZLT22E7,I was pleasantly surprised,"I tend to over-research things before I buy them, and for once I purchased this All-In-One Printer without reading the comments of the people who bought it--on the basis of CNet's recommendation.  After purchasing I happened to read the user's comments on CNet, and they were predominantly negative.  I crossed my fingers that it was due to the tendency for more people who are unhappy with their purchase to post a comment, than people who are happy with it.  Luckily, that seems to be the case!I'm a mac user, and the hardware seems to be wonderful, the printer prints consistently and beautifully, and my only complaint at this point is that I didn't look at the measurements--the unit is &#34;Pro&#34; as in &#34;Office-Sized.&#34;  But I'm really happy with it.  I haven't had it long enough to know if ink is expensive or not, so I can't speak to the unit's economy of use, but the ink cartridges that came with it are still cranking out quality copies several weeks later--a good sign.",

I can go to brick and mortar stores and not be browbeat into a review.In this case I am quite pleased with the product and the delivery.Only the demand for a review is at question.",
21,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,0,0,9-Feb-14,A6VLNKCP3HXWX,Nice Printer,Everything set up easily just as it was supposed to. Even was able to get the cloud printing via an email address to work first time out.  Ink Cartridges for the printer are somewhat expensive but then again seems HP makes more money off its ink then it does the printer itself.  Print quality is good and was even able to find everything I needed on line to add another the printer to another computer.,
22,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,2,9,9-Feb-14,A11LK5POWCGD2U,Why I hate this printer.,"Actually, why you should hate any Hewlett Packard printer.I purchased the Officejet Pro 8600 printer 18-24 months ago and it worked great.  Several months later Apple introduced its new operating system, Mavericks.  HP has not updated it's software to accommodate Mavericks and I have been waiting patiently.  Finally I called HP and they told me they have no plans on doing so, but suggested I purchase another printer from them at a discount.They have no plans on updating the software so they can force you to abandon a perfectly good printer and purchase another one.  Which, I assume, they will not support in a few months when Apple introduces its next operating system.To be fair it does work most of the time when wired to the printer using USB.  It doesn't work using WiFi.To add to my frustration with HP they tell you its time to refill your cartridges long before they are empty, trying to get you throw away an ink cartridge that may be capable of printing hundreds of additional pages,  And, recently I put a brand new HP brand ink cartridge in the printer and it rejected it saying it had expired!!3/8 Update:  And another thing, if you refill one of their ink cartridges the printer will not accept it!!!I hate Hewlett Packard as a company and you should too.",
23,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,0,0,8-Feb-14,A3434L0OWZQUC,Got a defect product but good refund service!!,"The product functions are matched with what I needed.  However, one major function (ADF - auto document feeder) does not work.  This means you could not do a batch copy/scan/fax..  So, decide to return the product.  Then, found out the return process is very simple and actually got full refund..  So, I give a good rating in turn of product and service provided by Amazon.  Will continue to buy product from Amazon in this case!!",
24,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,0,2,8-Feb-14,A7AMWB82PCH9L,Had to send back.,Found that buying used is not the way to go.  Plus it doesn't come withwindows 8 software although it is downloadable.,
25,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,1,1,8-Feb-14,A3M9KDI4CM058H,amazing,"I have been using this printer for the last three months, and I have been pleasantly surprised with how much it does, at such reasonable price. The print/scan/copy quality is quite good. I really like the Apps functionality. I routinely use coloring/arts and crafts apps to print stuff for my kids, who really love this printer too! The duplex printing and scanning works really well too.On the negative side: when the paper supply is low, the printer sometimes will draw more than one page to print a sheet. This obviously messes up the printout. Another slightly negative thing is the accuracy of the touchpad. If you're used to the touch accuracy of and iPhone, you may be annoyed. I'm used to it now though.",
26,XX,B005O55U2Y,3,0,0,8-Feb-14,A3DLBWQREOR8SG,Wireless Not So Much...,"We have had this printer for around a year and a half.  Last June, the wireless connectivity became a huge problem.  Sometimes it would be connected but the computer wouldn't see it.  Other times, it wasn't connected at all.  And occasionally, things printed!  We spent hours researching and troubleshooting, and found a work-around.  Generally, when the printer initially boots (for me, at least), it is connected for about 15 minutes, so I try to keep it shut down unless I need it.  When I do need it and it has been in standby mode for a length of time, I bring it up, shut it off, wait a few minutes, boot it back up, and viola!  The stinkin thing works!I love this printer other than having this problem.  The print quality is great, and it's versatile.  I love being able to print pictures from it, as well as copy and scan.  The wireless problem is a huge 2-star discount though: our initial plan was to get a printer with wireless so we could hide it away somewhere and no have a large chunk of desk space obliterated.  FAIL!  It takes up a good amount of desk space, and if I ever want to print from my phone, I may as well be at the computer, because I have to sit beside it while I do the reboot.On a positive note, at least it works after a year and a half!  Our last one was a Lexmark that died 3 days out of warranty!",
27,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,0,0,7-Feb-14,A3D6CR0ZY7XR0E,Very nice!,"This printer does so much more than I thought a printer could do. I do not see myself using all the features, but it is nice to know I have them. So far this printer has no problems and works great.",
28,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,1,1,6-Feb-14,A34CUSOFPNGOH0,"Huge in size, but exceeds in every way","All the reviews are clear about this being a big printer.  Its look is imposing, but the footprint is barely larger than the Lexmark Pro it replaced. It's tall but that's because it has an awesome Auto Feed, and it was do double-sided scans.  Huge time-saver.  The print speed is incredible in B&W, and not much slower for Color.  The color copy quality is excellent.  Haven't printed photos - but would be surprised if it wasn't at the same quality as the rest of the functions.  Being able to print, fax and email from your mobile devices is such a bonus.",
29,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,0,0,6-Feb-14,A1EGW4KTV1C18K,Legit,works so far. had it for 3 days and has worked just fine. haven't tried the twin side printing yet!,
30,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,1,1,3-Feb-14,A1GAQRT4ZR2CR7,Starts great. Breaks quickly,I was very happy with the 8600 for about a year then it fell apart and HP customer service was horrible. Lines appeared on the scanner and every solution online didn't work. The &#34;pick up motor&#34; failed making the printer inoperable (google &#34;HP 8600 pick up motor&#34; and you'll find enough heartache to avoid buying this machine). This is a one-year printer and then it will need replacing.,
31,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,1,2,1-Feb-14,AIVGHFRE1YCLM,GOOD PRINTER,"I'M A HOME USER THAT TRIES 2 OTHER PRINTERS BEFORE THIS, (which I returned)). AN EPSON WHICH WOULDNT COMMUNICATE WITH MY CP, (after 2 hrs on the phone the teck told me I had a windows issue), AN A BROTHER WHICH WAS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THIS BUT KEPT BLOWING THE 11 AMP ELECTRIC BREAKER. I HAD A FRIEND WITH ME TO HELP SET IT UP AS MY EYESIGHT ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE.AFTER PLUCGGING IT IN THE SMART INSTALL TOOK OVER AND WE BOTH WERE AMAXZED AT HOW THE PRINTER WAS DOING THE ENTRE INSTALL WITHOUT US HAVING TO PUT THE SOFTWARE DISK, (included),IN THE PC TO LOAD. THO ONLY INPUT NEEDED ARE THE PERSONAL SET-UP SETTINGS FOR FAX AND PRINTING. (paper size, orientation, etc), IT SEEMS COMPLICATED TO USE AT FIRST BUT IT' ACTUALLY PRETTY INTUITIVE. JUST A LITTLE HANDS ON AND YOU'RE READY TO GO. I GOT A PAPER JAM ONCE, (which was my fault because I didn't properly align the paper in the adf), BUT IT CLEARED EASILY. JUST LIFT UP THE ADF AS IF YOU WERE SCANNING FROM THE GLASS AND ON THE BOTTOM OF THE ADF IS THE JAMMED PAPER WHICH YOU JUST PULL OUT.FIRST COPY OUT, FROM SLEEP MODE, TAKES ABOUT 12 SECONDS WHICH IS SLOW, ( i had a canon that did it in just over 4 sec), BUT AFTER THAT THEY SHOOT OUT ABOUT EVERY 2 SECONDS. IT IS NOISER THAN MY OLD CANON AND I WOULD RATHER HAVE A ;IGHTER COLOR, (ivory or light gray), BUT MOST NEW PRINTERS ARE DARKER IN COLOR. SOME PEOPLE COMPLAINED THAT IT WAS FLIMSY. I DON' FIND IT THAT WAY. IT'S SOIDLY CONSTRUCTED. I ONLY HAD IT FOR A WEEK AND ALL'S WELL SO FAR.",
32,XX,B005O55U2Y,2,0,0,1-Feb-14,A1JNM224HBUXG9,I'm torn,"It seems to work ok now but the first few days were a painful. The yellow starter cartridge had leaked out in the original packaging. I had it all over me, my clothes and the counter. The next day I purchased a new yellow cartridge. I installed it and then tried to set it up. The setup failed because I wasn't using the startup cartridge. I won't bore you with the rest but getting it going was painful. However, now that we have been able to use it for the last week we really like it. Only issue now is when we try to use eprint it's hit or miss as to if it is 'found'",
33,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,0,0,1-Feb-14,A2ADEKB4LBVW3W,huge step forward,"I had a predecessor printer from HP which is about five years old.  This one is faster, smoother and more capable.  Better in every way I can think of.  I'd have to recommend it.",
34,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,0,0,31-Jan-14,A3E44U3ZA53NC0,Great Quality Printer,"I've had a wide variety of printers and multi-function machines over the years at my office, and this has been the best by a wide margin. If there is any down side, it would be the size (it's simply not a compact, space-saver machine). That said, it's nothing I'd hold against it, as it does exactly what it says and I've had no issues with it at all. It is also very frugal with ink (better than many I've had in the past), and the quality of the scans is excellent (it even makes good use of the file size to generate a good quality scanned image).",
35,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,0,0,30-Jan-14,A2TKPGJ9Y88YKG,THIS IS THE BEST PRINTER I'VE HAD.,The color is very sharp and I love the fact that it connects to the computer wirelessly.  I can have the printer in a separate location from where the computer is in case my desk is getting full.,
36,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,1,1,29-Jan-14,A5WJ8ODDXC3YN,Hidden little gem of a workhorse,"Look up how this printer compares to all the others.  It looked to me like it was right up there in the top 3 of its class in all the various categories.  The wireless feature is so great!I don't like that you have to sign up for a snapfish account in order to use the email printing feature but it really isn't that big of a problem... one more dang password to remember.It's not the smallest in it's class, but it makes up for it's bulk with shear performance and ink conservation.",
37,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,0,0,28-Jan-14,A3L7VM476R4XNN,Great concept low quality,"Looks great and read the online reviews but printing graphic documents like shown in the sample image, come out faded and streaky. Currently too busy to to try to find out if its defective or if they sent bad ink or just the product quality in general since the point of getting it was to save time. Regretting not getting the Canon now.",
38,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,1,1,28-Jan-14,A2OIUHUJPGA8C2,Great AiO printer. WiFi/AirPrint huge plus.,"Easy setup.

FEDEX left it on the front porch (we dont use) which is open it must have been there for three days in the rain. The outer box was soaked, lucky the inside box was not soaked. I do have a sign on the front door to deliver to the rear door.",
41,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,8,8,22-Jan-14,A3I9M26ZVKT335,It's a complicated bipolar printer,"Before buying this printer, take a look to see how old some of the positive reviews are. Then google 'HP Officejet Pro 8600 won't print or scan' and you'll see a tragically long list of results. Then check out the forums with people begging for help with all sorts of advice on doing a hard restart on the modem, fiddling with printer spool resets, links to the print and scan doctor, etc. No easy answers, just links to other pages with more instructions on what you might try.So if you enjoy troubleshooting, plan to put the printer on a big lazy susan (to continually turn it around to pull off the back accessory to pull out crunched paper), don't mind wasting a monumental amount of paper and have a really high threshold for frustration - this is the 'all-in-one' printer for you!Sometimes it will print from your iPad, sometimes it won't. Sometimes it will only work with your computer. Just give yourself a couple of hours to read up on how to potentially troubleshoot the problem or simply enjoy some quiet time while on hold waiting for tech support to answer. However, if you have a Mac, please note that 24/7 support is ONLY available for Windows users. Mac users should schedule all printing problems for 'free' phone support during business hours, Monday-Friday.And if that weren't enough to tempt you, the touchpad control panel was apparently developed with technology from 2004. It's so retro. Since it hardly works, you can instead toggle through each number to get to the right letter to connect to your modem. It'll make you so nostalgic for your old flip phone. And probably for your old printer too.",

44,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,1,2,20-Jan-14,AR7OGPV5412U6,Feature-rich printer. 2 thumbs up!,"First of all, let me say that the only thing that would lower my rating is if I experience the ink consummation issues others have reported. I've only had the printer a couple of days, so, I don't have a feel for that aspect yet.Out-of-the-box, the printer was very simple to set up.  Within minutes, I was printing wirelessly from my Samsung tablet (using HP's eprint app). A few minutes later, and I was able to print using HP's web services, by simply emailing an attachment to the address established and tied to my printer. Very cool.",
45,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,2,2,20-Jan-14,A1RL0AMW0ZU1U,A review from a long time All-In-One user,"I have been a home office worker for several years.  I used the 7600 Series printer for 6 years of hard daily use and it did an excellent job with a few quirks.  It is quite clear that HP was paying attention, because those quirks are gone in the 8600 Series.  Specifically, document feeding is flawless, the paper tray has been completely redesigned and a much needed wireless feature has been added.  For the price I purchased this for on Amazon, it is a great value.If you're new to the HP All-In-One printers, they represent a nearly maintenance free printer that will give you years of great service in all the functions - printer, flat bed and sheet fed scanner, fax - they perform.  If you are a home office worker with limited tech support options, this multi-function device is an ideal choice.",
46,XX,B005O55U2Y,2,2,3,17-Jan-14,A3JRBZUUWAKXC7,DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY DUPLEX LEGAL SIZE PAPER,"The printer itself works fairly well. My issue with it is that, despite what they would lead you to believe based on the description, the duplexer physically does not support any paper size bigger than 8.5x11. Once I began investigating, I found numerous entries on the HP support site stating this to be the case. One example is here: [...]This is tragic as I purchased the printer specifically for auto-duplexing legal pages and this makes it useless for me. Learn from my mistake and if you need legal paper duplexing do not buy this printer.",

I print from different programs, sometimes facebook and always have good results.I plan to test other paper next month and will update",

Set up was easy and the machine is performing as expected.  I highly recommend this machine to anyone with a small business.  The duplex faxing capabilities are great for sending double-sided forms.,

We bought this for our IPad/IPhones since the old 8500 wouldn't work with them.I encountered a MAJOR problem in set up.  I could not download the software/drivers.  I'm docking two stars for this.  That's the bad news.  The good news is HP tech support is fantastic. I called them and they just took over my computer and fixed it.  They said there was a compatibility issue between my ATT u/verse router and the printer.  It took two hours on the phone which is ridiculous, but half that was just waiting on the downloads so I didn't have stay around the whole time.One could probably argue whether it was an HP problem or an ATT problem.  Either way they fixed it.As far as setting up the &#34;I's&#34; for printing, there was no set up.  They take a few seconds to find the printer, and you're printing, super simple.",

53,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,4,4,9-Jan-14,A1ZPEYBRJMUDZQ,The best printer I have owned,"I have owned and thrown away five inkjet printers, including an Officejet, in the last 13 years. Some lasting two years some a little longer. Versions touting as photo printers never delivered truly crisp results. Ink cartridge volumes always left me wanting. Two sided printing required manual flipping without auto feeds for the scanner.I decided to take the jump up to the Officejet for what I hoped was better print quality, more features and much better durablity. Not wanting to shell out the cash for a laserjet, I had high hopes. I have  had this printer for almost two years and decided to write this review because of my experience with it.One word- excellent!Print quality is as good as a laser printer. Colors are vibrant and crisp. Graphics and pictures look like they came from the print shop. And it prints soooo fast! The volume of ink in the cartridges provides loads of prints. The XL cartridges give even more prints. Automatic two-sided prints are a snap and the auto feed does two-sided scanning like a champ.I haven't mentioned the wireless printing and scanning ability. This is the first wireless printer that has delivered flawlessly the whole time. I have to admit that I haven't even touched any of the apps built in to the touch screen (which I love), but I may.This next comment is not HP approved but unlike in the past printers, when using non-oem cartridges they sometimes didn't like them and wouldn't work. But after market ones have been working, just recognize that HP will void the warranty when thier products are not used and the ink level feature doesn't work. But the value of remanufactured cartridges makes it very palatable for me. Two XL black for $15, and I just bought a package with two black XL and a set of XL colors for $24.If you are looking for the best printer for the money, this is it. Now its even less expensive than when I bought it on sale. Considering the longevity I am getting I think this has years to go yet.",
54,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,4,6,8-Jan-14,A3ZWT79NCQL9F,Short-lived,"It was pretty nice while it lasted (approx. I year).  When I needed to replace the included &#34;setup cartridges&#34; after about a year, I spent over $100 on new (genuine, directly from HP) cartridges.  When I installed the new cartridges, the printer would not function.  I was told by HP support the print head was &#34;bad&#34;, and that the only solution was to replace the printer.",
55,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,2,3,8-Jan-14,ATGKFWLWFWVXP,Best Inkjet I Have Ever Owned,"I had a really nice color laser all in one but upgraded to a Mac computer and they didn't get along.  So a shopping I went.  I did all kinds of research and looked at everything laser, inkjet, and many brands.  I decided between this and an Epson.  I went to an office chain and asked what they recommend and this is what they told me to get.I couldn't be happier with this printer!  If you are thinking about a laser because of the cost of printing being cheaper that isn't true with this printer.  The cost per page is the same as a laser, in fact it is cheaper than the color laser all in one I had.  The ink cartridges also don't dry out like they used to.  These cartridges are good for years.  I am amazed at how many pages have been printed on the setup cartridges.  I have had this since September, it is now January and I haven't replaced any cartridges yet.  I have printed a ream and a half worth of pages.  I can't wait to see how long the XL cartridges will last.It was easy to setup on both my Mac, iPad, and PC.  All of the devices installed in seconds!  One thing that really impressed me is that it automatically installs itself on Windows 8.  Print, scan, and copy quality are really good.  It is super fast at printing too.  It is nice and simple to use especially with the touch screen.  I like the duplex printing, copying, and scanning.  Trying to find a duplex scanning printer is a hard task.",

58,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,15,16,5-Jan-14,A15WLRK975HU6G,Former HP R&D Director now an Epson customer,"I'm a retired Inkjet HP R&D Director. My teams developed many ink cartridges over the years. I'm proud of the underlying inkjet technology and believe that it's superior to competitor products. However, my last two All-in-One printers have failed just beyond the warranty period. The touch screen display of my 8600 failed after 15 months. It's an easy replacement - just seven screws but the replacement part is not available. My OfficeJet Pro 7600 needed a new scanner feed paper pick roller. Clearly a user replaceable part but also not available. Support told me to reboot the printer for a clearly mechanical problem - the tackiness of a roller.Like most individuals these days I print only a small amount so overall cost-per-page, where HP excels, is less important in the buying decision. Reliability is number one. HP has cheapened the designs over the years to where reliability has been compromised. Out of warranty support is nonexistent and replacement parts are not available to those of us who are handy. The bottom line is that I have sworn off HP and replaced my failed 8600 with an Epson WF-3540. It's half the price of the 8600 if you can find it on sale and it has good reliability reviews. It has twice the cost per page of the HP but if the Epson reliability is good they will earn the profits from future ink sales. HP - please note that I retired without a buyout so I'm free to speak my mind.",

64,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,7,9,31-Dec-13,ASHDZFKEMRR0,AVOID!!!!,"Absolute POS. HP has once again screwed their customers over, then insult their integrity even more with BS excuses as to why they do things.This printer will not, I repeat.... will NOT... print in black only, if ANY of the 3 color cartridges is empty. Why would a company produce such a STUPID software, that prevents its owners from printing in black only, when the color cartridge(s) are empty? HP 'says&#34; it is to protect the print head and keep ink in it, so even in black printing, you are using your color cartridges, even though you dont know it, and dont want to.Save the BS excuses, HP. Ive been in the computer industry for 20yrs. Ive NEVER had a print head go bad from lack of ink... EVER! And I dont print often. Nope, this is just another way for HP to dip into your pocket, and control how you use your equipment. So, if you are in a bind and need to print a black document, but all 3 of your color cartridges go out (from HP programing their software to use color ink without your consent, even on black only print jobs) then you have to run out and spend $70 to replace your color cartridges.... just to print ONE BLACK INK ONLY PAGE!.Ill NEVER buy another HP product. The only thing they care about is the almighty dollar, and if I do have trouble... I can never talk to someone that speaks freakin English!",

I have not found anything I don't like about it.",
66,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,0,0,31-Dec-13,A238MMVZB6G7LL,"I thought it was good, but it is terrible","I will stick with this from my original review: It is fast and the print quality on normal paper is very good.  The setup is extremely simple, both on the printer and when I added it to my iMac.  It also looks fantastic in the office, and the touch screen controls are easy to use.Then there are these issues:This printer has a feed problem with photo paper when you first start using it.  If you use cheaper, thin photo paper you may not have any issue.  However, the thicker paper will not get picked up by the feed, but never fear the fix is simple.  Open a blank document and print 100 pieces of paper with nothing on them.  This will break the feed wheel in enough to make it work with any paper.  I was about ready to send it back until I read this online.  I do think it is ridiculous that this needs to be done and HP doesn't make it better known.The photo print quality is terrible.  We came from a 6 year old Canon that just wasn't printing as well as it used to, and this new HP is actually ten steps backward!  The quality is terrible.  I even went and bought the HP paper (highest quality) like many internet posts mentioned, and still it is bad.  If you hold it about 6 feet away it is good, but get up close and you will see graininess and other issues that simply aren't there when it is on your computer.  We even tried going through HP customer service (which is also very terrible), thinking that there was an issue.  A print head and two replacement printers later, and it is still identically terrible.  I have now returned everything.If you don't care about picture quality, then this printer is very fast and easy to use, but I would recommend looking at a different printer.",

Good piece of office equipment . . .  but . . .","Okay - I used to have a home office, and I really liked how well this thing does wireless, has a pretty good scanner, prints good quality stuff and all but it was designed so that even if you want to print everything in black, when your yellow or any other color is running low, it will not print.  There is no bypass.  There is no workaround.  There is no way to put a filler in so you can hit that last minute deadline.  You have to pay them extra to keep another yellow cartridge around even when you don't want to do so.  I found this to be extremely aggravating.  Enough so that in a heat of passion I desired to give it one star.  This one error makes less worthy than its competition for an upstart company on a shoestring with tight margins.  This printer will drive your office costs up in an unreasonable way due to how they stick you on the ink.  What's more, their employees are extremely arrogant about it.  I probably wouldn't even be adding this lovely bit of feedback to the internet, except that when I was searching the net for a workaround, I read the comment of one of HP's employees arrogantly talking about how there is no workaround and why their product is superior - essentially inviting the beknighted soul who was up against a deadline to go sit on a tack.  I would like to tell HP that if it were my consultant, I would stop hiring it.  If it were my employee, it would be the first on the chopping block when times got tough, and should it fall to its competitors, I will not be sympathetic.  If you buy this printer, you'll be very happy with it, except for the ink thing. It's one of those products designed to save you from yourself.

It lasted exactly six months beyond the one year warranty period. It spent its entire service life plugged into an uninterruptable power supply- so it never saw a surge or a brownout. Other gear plugged into the same UPS, including an Epson printer, a desktop, and a monitor, still works. Wireless never worked properly due to the fact that a wireless request would not bring the unit online, and it tended to lose it's ip address because it would stop transmitting- causing the wireless router to give it a new address every time it came back up. The E-Print function was useful, and it did work as a wired network printer- but the cartridges did not last as long as I anticipated (burned ink every time you had to recycle power to clear one of the not infrequent &#34;hangs&#34;). It had some great features: the entire print head assembly is easily removed and replaced. It had an integral duplexer that allows two-sided printing. The software allowed it to detect multiple computers in a wired network and choose the destination for a scan manually accomplished at the printer- and the print quality remained good until it stopped due to an illusory &#34;paper jam&#34; issue. I dug into this to find out exactly why it thought a jam existed; It was a failed sensor near the paper tray reporting an obstruction due to a bad photodiode which no longer transmits (I have a technical background which often allows me to fix things to component level). This part is in a chunk of cast plastic- and not easily replaced. The cost of repair would exceed the current value of the machine. I used to love HP... until the likes of Carly Fiorina got their hooks into it, HP gear was very solid indeed.

I've had this printer for close to a year and it has been a constant irritation since purchase.  The print quality is great but with today's technology a $99 print would do just as well.  My issues are simple: 1) the scanning mechanism is horribly noisy in duplex mode & can't scan in duplex unless the sheets are standard or legal size sheets.  Additionally anything that is an 'odd' size needs to be scanned on the glass plate instead of the ADF.  2)  We do a lot of printing in our home office but we only do it once or twice a week.  The print head/nozzle on this machine is ALWAYS clogged and ALWAYS needs cleaning which waste paper & ink.  If you don't print daily don't buy this unit!  Lastly, to save money we purchase none HP ink cartridges and the printer politely reminds us of that regularly.  It would be really great is a company like HP could produce a consumer friendly product that works well instead of designing their machines to maximize their profits.In closing my previous printer, a Canon MP530, was fantastic with none of these issues and we used it even less.  The only reason for replacing it was that the scanning mechanism had gone out after 5 years of great service.",

And, it uses some color ink on EVERY job, regardless if it is B&W or not (wasteful), which means that when you need more black ink, you will have to buy color ink, meaning that you will flush HUNDREDS of dollars down the drain on this printer.So, it will waste color ink on a black-and-white job, when no color is needed.

This is horrible. If one color goes dry, your printer doesn't work.2. Each time you remove or replace a cartridge, it sucks out 10% of the ink in all of your cartridges for an &#34;initialization&#34; process. My Cyan ($35) went dry so my printer was useless. I had plenty of black and at least 10% left in the other colors but the printer wouldn't even allow me to print in grey scale. I bought a replacement cyan but the process of replacing it sucked the magenta ($35) and yellow ($35) dry. I then replaced those one-at-a-time, which sucked the black dry ($35) too. When I started, I had plenty of black ink all I had wanted to do was print a b&w business document. It cost me over $100 just to restore minimum functionality to my 'printer'. I will do better research in the future. This was underhanded on the part of HP to maintain their flow of ink sales and I will not purchase any more of their products.",

Documents flow in and out freely even if they are a reciept taped to a piece of copy paper.  The flat bed can scan a legal document which is also something that is harder to find in an economical desktop unit.  Add double sided copying or scanning and you have all the functionality of a large copier.  The connectivity couldn't be better either as it can connection via LAN, WAN, or USB to any computer on your network.

This printer has 3 MAJOR shortcomings - 1) print quality is sub par, nowhere near laser quality or even near the quality of my other inkjet.  2) There is no envelope feeder so you have to remove the paper from the tray, adjust the tray insert etc just to print an envelope.  I thought this is an 'office' product?  3) I get a line down the middle of all my copies.  Doesn't appear on scans or print jobs, just copies.",

As soon as I replace magenta, the printer said it was out of yellow. I replaced yellow, the printer said it was out of cyan. I replaced cyan, the printer said it was out of black. Back to the store I go...for $40 I buy the black cartridge. Now I have spend over $100 bucks to replace every cartridge...but the printer still wont print. After troubleshooting on my own to no avail, I contact HP support. They tell me it is a hardware issue (print head failure!) and the printer is out of warranty (by one month).

All the setup cartridges (ones installed at time of purchase) have been replaced in the last month with authentic HP cartridges.  The printer/scanner is dead and all I get is printhead failure, reinstall or replace.  I just spend $100 on authentic HP ink cartridges (which is way too much) and now cant even use them.  I cant even use the scanner because I cant clear the error from the panel.  How can this expensive inkjet copier/scanner printhead fail with about 1 year of light use.  HP you disappoint me.  Their support forum recommends to others that have had the same issue to buy a new printer.  Another USA company that is creating crap product and dont care about long term relationship with customers.  I need this machine to work.  If anyone has found a way to resolve this issue please reply (I'm sure to get an answer here faster than on HP forum).  If I had not thrown away the empty Magenta setup cartridge I would have put it back in just to see if the printhead would work again.  Something hinkey about all these printhead failures.

Got in contact with HP and they said it was because it was plugged into a surge protector(apparently one in machine per woman on phone), so connected to power without surge protector.

I called HP Tech Support today and after troubleshooting, found out that it is a hardware issue.  HP can do nothing.  The tech support said that our warranty was 100 days out of date, which means that HP only warrants their product for 6 months.  It's basically junk after a year.

155,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,3,4,8-Sep-13,A1HVOYERDXN441,Fast with great interface,"I have had several printers over the years, and I absolutely love this printer.  The only downside based on my needs is that it is quite large.  What I particularly like compared with previously owned printers:  - goes into sleep mode when not in use, but comes out of sleep mode quickly when job received  - very fast print start time.  The per page print time advertised by printers is meaningless if it takes a full minute or more before the printing starts.  This printer starts printing within a few seconds, even when in sleep mode.  - very fast print including full color, high resolution pictures.  When I printed a page of pictures and it was completed in a few seconds, including time to come out of sleep mode, I thought something had happened to interrupt the printout.  But, when I went to retrieve the page to see what happened, there it was, the full picture.  - printout quality is excellent  - 2-sided copy/scanning easy to use, feeder works well  - initial setup was quick and painless, had no issues using the first time  - tray holds 250 sheets of paper, not constantly running out mid-print  - ink usage is minimal, after printing quite a few pages including pictures, the ink still shows as nearly full, easy to check ink status from printer or computer  - touch screen to control the printer is well laid out, easy to read and responsive to the touch  - useful to print from iphone or email, can send a printout from work and it is waiting for me when I arrive homeBasically the printer is easy to use, fast and has the functionality I most need.  I have not had any performance issues and highly recommend it.",

I purchased it directly from HP.I print a lot of cardstock and graphics as well as text.  I also occasionally print photos.  This printer bungles everything but plain text on plain paper.Pros:this unit is huge and it prints black text okay.Cons:* The print quality for graphic is quite poor compared to anything I've used in the last several years.  Even at the highest quality settings, every graphic has streaks through it and the speckles throughout - something I'm not used to seeing in a printer that claims to be able to print photos.* This does not deal nicely with heavy papers (HP premium photo paper, cardstock or otherwise) - it puts a nice wrinkle at the top/center of every sheet.* Configuration is awkward - want to scan a document to your computer? you need to download and install another HP program/client on your computer and try to get it configured. Funny, but with my previous printers, I easily selected the desired destination folder for scans upon initial setup and then was off and running.  Want to use the e-print feature?  Have fun setting it up.* The USB and memory card slots are of limited functionality.  They can only read jpg files for direct printing (you can't transfer anything to your computer from them).I wish I could get my money back from HP for this.",

158,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,21,23,2-Sep-13,A4CB4HEEFC4CM,What HP doesn't want you to know about this printer,"I have to admit, the cartridges that come with the printer last for a long time, and at first I was very happy with this purchase. But then I learned the hard way that this printer steals your ink in 2 REALLY sneaky ways:1) This printer will not let you print if ANY ONE of the cartridges is empty. Yes, you read that correctly. Despite having 4 independent ink cartridges that you can replace... you cannot actually run out of any ink if you want to keep printing. For example, you have a term paper due and this printer runs out of Magenta. You think, WHEW! No problem, I'm just printing Black and White text... NOT WITH THIS PRINTER! DON'T PLAN ON JUST PRINTING IN BLACK INK!! (SEE 2).2) Even if you select the option to 'Only Print in Black Ink' THIS PRINTER WILL STILL USE YOUR COLOR INK. Just search for 'hp officejet pro 8600 won't print black only' to see what you're in for. (I wish I had searched that... before I had several cartridges of color ink stolen by HP engineers).These 2 points combine to form a nightmarish cycle of needless cartridge purchases and printing 'lockdowns', i.e. times where the printer won't work ... even though it could work.If you run into #1) you can (in a REAL pinch) put tape over the oblong hole of the empty cartridge to trick the printer into thinking it's full. This will void your warranty and could ruin your printer (ink could dry in the printhead). There is no fix for #2.[Updated 11/13/2013 to reflect that unlike previous versions of the HP 8000 series printer, this version does not actively block users from printing after print cartridges digitally 'expire'.)",
159,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,3,4,2-Sep-13,AR5C5BBQ87IS8,HP 8600 Plus combo printer,"I really love this printer! I've had a whole series of HP's over the years. The last one was the 7900, which was beginning to chew up print cartridges so I decided it needed to be replaced. Given how inexpensive the 8600 plus was, I wasn't expecting how much I'd like it. For example, the new method of quoting print speeds had me thinking it was slower than the 7900; instead it was blazing fast in comparison. I had no idea how addictive the automatic double-sided printing (and scanning) would be, especially when coupled with a utility program I've had for years called Clickbook. In a flash, 50 or 60 page manuals are printed as 12-15 page booklets. In the past, I had to go through a user-intensive stage of printing one side, waiting for it to complete, then putting the paper back into the paper tray, and printing the other side. I also frequently use Hallmark's Card Studio greeting card program and again I just send the card to print and it comes out with both sides printed perfectly with no extra effort on my part.The wireless is also a good addition. I could have set up my 7900 that way, but I never did, probably because I'd had problems with other supposedly wireless printers. This one though was easily set-up and works like a charm.",

I cleaned it with a clean cotton cloth & rubbing alcohol and it works great. It was brand new so I don't know why the cartridge dispenser was covered with black ink. But since I cleaned it no problems. Easy to set up. Wireless works great. I installed the printer software on both an XP machine and a Win7 machine even though the two machines are networked (that's a whole other story). I've only had it a month but so far I am extremely pleased. One thing I would say is that the OCR software is not as good as my previous printer, a Lexmark. The Lexmark would render any complex scanned doc in Word w. near 100% perfection. Considerable less so with this OCR software. But that aside the printer is top notch. The touch screen is cool. I don't think you'll be disappointed with this printer. At least I'm not.BTW; that Lexmark was a piece of junk.",

I've found that the print quality is excellent for text and presentation graphics.  Photo quality is also quite good.  Very fast printing.Cons:  Occasionally connection to the printer is lost when transferring photos from an inserted SD card to PC connected via USB.  I have to pull out the card, reinsert it, and reselect the photos to be transferred.  I wish there was a manual feed slot for printing on envelopes, card stock, etc.  Occasionally, scans of documents using the ADF are a little crooked.All in all, I am very impressed and pleased with this printer.

HP sent me a replacement because it was still under warranty.  The replacement was just as bad. So, HP replaced with my current 8600 Plus.  I've had it working since February 2012 and until recently it worked great. Setup out of the box was easy, including setting up the network.  Scanning is a breeze, but wish it were faster.  I love the 2 sided printing and the auto feed top feeder plus the large paper tray.Recently, I began having trouble with color printing.  I have had to repeatedly remove and replace the cartridges, run cartridge alignments and clean printheads.  Today, I think it reached it's limit.  I ran every self test and correction method I could find.  The last instructions I received was that I needed to replace my print heads. OUCH! This is expensive.  When calling HP I learned that the printhead will cost me $120.  For $70 more I can buy an all new 8600 Plus.I have to admit that I am a power user printer.  I run a small insurance business from my home and I go through paper like nobody's business.  So, I'm not surprised that the printheads are shot.I also love that I can order the XL cartridges which are more cost effective AND they last longer.  I have never been able to figure out how to E-Print though.  And I don't have time to mess with trying to set it up so I just let that feature go.  I also love the faxing capability because I can store frequently used fax numbers and just pull them up and hit send.  GREAT feature!  It's also nice to just touch the display to see where ink levels are sitting.  I have printed a few photos on this printer and it does an acceptable job.  But then, I didn't buy it to print photos.Now I'm shopping for another printer and it looks like it's going to be the 8600 Plus AGAIN.  I have no major complaints about this machine, I'm used to the way it works, it's quirks, the print quality and the setup.  So, here I go, biting the bullet again.  I have past computer sales experience and HP has always been the top choice for me in printers.",

Two seconds later will not print (even black and white) because Yellow cartridge is TOTALLY GONE apparently. Go buy $60 worth of the 3 color cartridges (replaced the black a couple weeks ago with no problem at all.) Replace the Yellow. It tells me a cartridge is defective and needs to be replaced-go get a new cartridge. Umm. I just did. Take it in and out about 3 times. Turn the printer off and on about 3 times. OK. Now it tells me the Cyan cartridge is low. OK, got that with the Yellow. Same thing--the cartridge is defective and turn off and on and put in and out and finally OK. Then it still won't won't print...so I think What the Heck? and go ahead and replace the new Blue Cartridge. Prints and everything is fine.I loved this at first, but I so definately would not buy it again. It is the most annoying printer I have ever had.

It had the 2 drawers for paper, which was nice, because every time I want to print an envelope now I have to take all the paper out of this new 8600 and put one or two envelopes in.  Also the paper tray is low to the ground or surface of where the printer sits, so you have to keep the area clear of things cause the drawer has to be completely pulled all the way out.Other than that, it scans (So far..I only scanned two items so far) and prints from my iphone, which is an improvement and one of the reasons for the new printer.  I have the old one upstairs with my tenant.  So I'll see how it goes.  I actually bought two of these, so we'll see.Consumer reports gives this printer an exceptional rating, EXCEPT a BLACK CIRCLE for wasting print cartridge ink during maintenance.

Got right thru to service and they were extremely nice and perhaps helpful. They said HP paper had bar code that computer read although I didn't see any when purchased. I think it has to do with the weight of the photo paper but haven't experimented yet. Both print and photos very very good. Double sided works great.

The printer display leads you easily through the initial setup and provides quick and easy access to all the printer functions.  It is fast, efficient, and both the B&W and color print quality are quite good.  (I don't use this for photo printing I should note, but I am a photographer that makes demands beyond what might reasonably expect from what is essentially an office printer. I have a larger format printer with better user control for color management for that work.)Even for individuals, if one uses the extra large ink cartridges, the savings in ink will quickly pay for any difference in purchase price between this and a  less expensive and less capable printer. The duplexing offers opportunity for further savings in paper costs.",

When I do print something it is in grayscale i.e.; I never print in color, I have no need, however my color ink has to be replaced constantly. It is not cheap!

The second one is no better interns of configuring these features for a Mac. Instructions for configuration refer to menus and settings that don't even appear in the software and the HP customer support was terrible.

I 'm already looking for a different new printer. I just wish I had returned it when I could. I haven't used the feeder much, but it seems everytime I have something really important to print or fax, the paper feeds unevenly and so the copy is lop sided or your 'master' copy is jammed and wrinkled or torn IF and when you get it removed.

I believe that sometimes a product works great and gets great reviews, the manufacter then starts 'cutting corners' trying to save money and ends up with a piece of junk like this.

Or, if you take a (stupid) leap of faith and think it will print correctly, you have to sift thru and find out which pages mis-printed, re-print those, sort thru THOSE to find the misprints, re-print those, and then throw away a couple trees' worth of paper and expensive ink.Piece of CRAP.",

However, at the time of purchase, I did not realize that, on this particular model (as well as other models), HP has inserted a micro chip in each of the printer ink cartridges. What that means is that whenever any cartridge is depleted (color or black ink) the owner of the machine cannot print anything until each of the depleted cartridges is replaced by, of course, an authentic HP printer cartridge. I feel as though I'm being held hostage in my own home/office by HP. Normally, when color cartridges are depleted, I continue to print black and white; just to save a little money. If a good class action attorney reads this review, it might be a good case to consider.",

I've cleaned the print head - twice, through all 3 levels of cleaning and just pouring ink down the drain with the test pages. The next menu solution is to replace the print head. I've got a better idea, I'm going to replace the printer! No more HP anything - and this comes from someone who has used HP everything over many years (15+) and now - nothing but disappointment. Don't waste your money on this unit.",
204,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,3,4,13-Jul-13,A3ODKR1M2G4FEV,Worked until the original ink ran out...,"I bought this printer less than a year ago in October of '12. Initially I was happy with it. It did a good job printing, it was fast, it was wireless, and the ink lasted a long time.  However, when the yellow and black ink ran out I bought a new set of genuine HP ink cartridges. When I installed the two new cartridges, the printer verified that they were genuine HP cartridges (which I bought from Amazon), and proceeded to go through the &#34;preparing&#34; process that the printer goes through when a new cartridge is installed. Immediately at this point the printer froze up with a &#34;Printer Failure&#34; error on the screen. The printer screen had a message stating that &#34;There is a problem with the printer or ink system. Turn printer off, then on. If problem persists, contact HP.&#34; Of course after several attempts of turning the printer off and back on, as directed, as well as taking the cartridges back out and putting them in again, the error message still showed up. I then tried putting the original two cartridges back in, but the error stayed the same. There was no way to reset it. There was not even a message stating that the old cartridges were empty or anything to that effect; just the same &#34;printer failure&#34; message.At this point I was very frustrated. I spent $200 dollars on this printer (plus $112 worth of ink) and got less than a year of use out of it.  Once the original cartridges were used up, the printer is now junk.I Googled the problem and found an HP site to check to see if the printer was still under warranty.  HP indicated on the site that the warranty had expired back in April of this year (just six months after purchase). I filled out a petition form to challenge that expiration date, so we'll see how that goes. If HP will ends up honoring the warranty I'll revise my review to reflect that goodwill gesture. However, even at that point I'm afraid that HP will likely charge me for the shipping, and I'll still be out of a printer for a few weeks. Either way, this has been a very disappointing purchase.As I mentioned before, I was initially happy with this printer, but the final outcome has turned into a disaster. If HP doesn't honor the warranty (for at least a year) I think I'll be done with HP for good.For now I'll have to wait...without a printer................................................Wish me luck.",
205,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,50,54,12-Jul-13,AXN0PI53B0TAA,BUYER BEWARE!!! DO NOT BUY HP OFFICEJET 8600!!!,"So let me first start off with the only good note on this printer, like the other reviews it is extremely easy to setup the wireless printing feature on this printer and the printer itself prints nicely even in draft mode. HOWEVER, this printer is a complete disaster from a user perspective. Unless you have an endless money supply and don't mind stock piling plenty of replacement cartridges.This printer is the last straw for me in purchasing HP Inkjet Printer products. This printer's design clearly shows the number one motivation of HP, revenue over customer satisfaction.There are two completely unacceptable functional designs in this printer.1. Each time you install a new inkjet cartridge the printer goes through a 'printer initializing' process. During this process the program sucks 10% of the remaining ink cartridges installed. So if you replace each of the four cartridges over a one week period without printing a single page each of the remaining cartridges will contain 30% less ink once the last cartridge is installed. This means that you basically have to replace all cartridges at the same time unless you don't mind wasting 30% of your ink.2. The MOST FRUSTRATING PART OF THIS PRINTER is the fact that you CANNOT PRINT unless all cartridges are full.So I am getting ready for a critical meeting in 1 hour, I need to print a multi-million dollar proposal for my top client for this meeting. I know I have plenty of black ink because I installed a new cartridge yesterday. I go to print this important document and the printer WILL NOT PRINT MY BLACK AND WHITE DOCUMENT BECAUSE THE CYAN INK was now out of ink! Now I know for a fact that this Cyan printer cartridge contained at least 10% ink when I installed the new black ink cartridge because a ran the printer report. So now I am panicking and grab another Cyan ink cartridge that I know contained 20% of ink remaining when I replaced it. It once again goes through it 'printer initializing' process and now it won't print my BLACK AND WHITE DOCUMENT because the yellow ink is now gone!!! Keep in mind the yellow ink had a little less than a 1/4 of its ink remaining before I replaced the Black ink cartridge. Now after replacing the Cyan cartridge now the yellow ink gone so I again replace it with a used cartridge that had about 1/4 remaining but after this initializing process now all color ink cartridges are completely empty. Keep in mind, during this time I haven't been able to PRINT a single document since replacing the Black cartridge the previous day. So now I am completely out of three ink cartridges all because I changed out three cartridges.So now I am so frustrated I want to throw the printer out my 10 story office window, if only the window opened. In a last ditch effort I call HP Support to ask how I can bypass the color cartridges to print my black and white document. I am told by support that the printer cannot print without the color cartridges. When I ask why I am told that it is due to the printer's high quality printing. So when I ask how in God's name does a yellow ink cartridge impact the quality of a black and white document, I get crickets chirping from the support person until he asks if I would like to speak with a supervisor. When I say yes, he places me on hold until the system hangs up on me 5 minutes later. I call back, now I immediately ask for a supervisor. The supervisor tells me that is the way the printer is designed. It uses color ink even in black and white documents to ensure 'quality' printing and says he will send me a link to contact the CEO with my comments.Moral of the story, NEVER buy a printer that 'requires' color cartridges to print black and white documents. There is only one reason that color ink is required to print black and white and it is to sell more ink cartridges. This printer is purposefully wasting color inks in order to force the buyer to replace the cartridges as much as possible. Until HP rewrites their printer software to eliminate this wasteful ink usage I think anyone that purchases any of their inkjet printers should have their head examined. By the way I worked for HP in their Enterprise Software division so I am not just some HP hater.",

Poor software/some issues,"Useful functions in small office:+ rare automatic two sided scanning that also keeps pages in right order when done+ rare automatic 2 sided borderless brochure paper printing without leaving any white(recommend hp paper)+ Laser printer like speed+ Larger paper tray and scanner document feeder than most+ Ample copy settings including 2 sided and ID copy(prints 2 ID sides on one page)+ Can share usb drive like a NAS, works well with a few people.+ Can scan and print at the same time.+ XL ink is much cheaper per page than most and needs to be changed less. Also very easy to swap out without pull tabs.+ Printing will stop right before the ink runs out(less ruined prints)and prompt you to replace it before printing the next page.  No more worrying if a color is going to run out when batch printing. Also has the option to print in b/w if out of color.+ Jams a lot less than most. Handles 50 pound paper very well.Annoyances- Software is not laid out in a user friendly way. Many settings you need to dig for.- Having to dig through the menu to get to the black ink only setting. Considering the really low b/w cost per page its annoying its not on the first page. Not to hard but if you have a lot of users they may not use it.- Often feeds a blank page after a printout. Have no clue why, HP has yet to comment on this and how to fix it.- When printing a ink heavy document rarely runs out of a color at the end of the page ruining it but then prompts for the ink to be replaced before continuing.- Not a lot of room to get inside of the printer if needing to clear a jam or other problems. At least they have a light inside like a refrigerator!Overall a good choice for a small office just plan on spending the time to learn the features that are often hidden. Laser printer like costs and speed with benefit of borderless/photo inkjet printing. Really nice for batch printing/scanning with the added bonus of automatic 2 side functionality. Certainly a nice all in one printer that can do more than most.",
209,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,0,0,9-Jul-13,AK8SI0XFYFTW1,Very versatile printer but with a few concerns,"I bought this printer to replace my (now broken) networked Canon laser all-in-one. It is noisier than the Canon and the text quality is less sharp (which is typical of most ink jets). However, the included software is very user friendly and easy to install and set up. Plus, being able to fax, scan, and print double-sided color copies is, of course very useful.I connected this printer with an ethernet cable to my wireless router, and now can access it from any of my PCs or my MacBook Pro or MacMini computers. The installation software makes all these networked connections easily and correctly.I like all the diagnostic tests that are included (e.g. fax setup report, ink supply, fax history, etc.).I do have one issue with the AirPrint feature.  I bought and installed the optional second 250-page paper tray.  When I print from my iPad (4th generation), or my Samsung Galaxy S4, I noticed that it always pulls paper from tray #1.  However, when installing the second tray, HP says to make the default tray #2.  That way, you can put special paper (e.g. photo paper, envelopes, card stock, etc.) in tray #1. So I did the tray configuration as suggested.  When using AirPrint, the printer tried to pull media from tray #1 which contained 4X6 photo paper, so that of course triggered an error (and the printer refused to print some email from my iPad).I will try to figure out how to make AirPrint pull paper from tray #2.I must also mention ink consumption.  The latest Consumer Reports says that this printer is among the worst printers for non-printing ink consumption (i.e. ink used for printer head cleaning and other maintenance functions).  I think this excess consumption can be mitigated by (1) the large size of the ink cartridges and (2) leaving the printer turned on (in sleep mode) all the time.Lastly, I did try printing a few photos.  They turned out pretty good...Which is a great feature of this printer.  I do have a dedicated Canon Pixma Pro-100 photo printer for 'serious'  photo prints, but honestly, the photo prints from the OfficeJet 8600 are very acceptable.",
210,XX,B005O55U2Y,2,3,4,4-Jul-13,A1VPC7FCT2NX6J,NO NO NO -- Don't buy this printer,"I bought this printer to replace a cheap HP all in one printer I have had for five years that has worked fantastically but was having issues due to age and use.  I wanted a more robust printer because I do a lot of printing.  This printer is a joke for the money.  It will not pull the paper through properly to get a straight scan. You have to use the glass tray.  The printing on some pages with lines is obvious that the paper wasn't pulled properly.  The paper tray is flimsy.  I can't get it to print the entire page (footer) without lying to it about the size of paper, whereas it printed fine before on my old cheap printer. I purchased it from Staples and since it has been three weeks, I can't return it so I am stuck with this junk.  I was planning to buy a HP all in one computer, but since I have seen the quality of the printer, I changed my mind and bought a Dell.  What has happened to HP???",

The touch screen is amazingly intuitive for performing simple tasks like copying, scanning, and printing photos from an SD card.The auto document feeder was a big selling point for us on this model, but we were sorely disappointed at how poorly it keeps documents aligned; almost every scanned document is skewed a little bit.  Putting inward pressure on the document guides seemed to help about 90% of the time, but was is an unfortunate chore.  Additionally, we were a bit frustrated that the scanner bed cover is not double-hinged, so scanning thick material like a book is awkward and hard to keep square to the glass (it puts pressure on one side of the book, pushing it a bit).We were also a bit disappointed that the printer does not come with a manual feed tray for one-off printing or thicker materials.  This caused cardstock to jam around the main roller.Our last frustration point is with the output tray -- basic 8.5x11 paper needs the extension pulled out which is incredibly flimsy and has a gravity-assisted popup paper stop.  This stop prevents longer material from coming out of the printer, but was disabled by taping down the paper stop.",

It is impossible for this printer to print in black-ink-only, despite the fact that black-ink-only and high quality grayscale are options you can choose.  Apparently the printer draws ink from the color cartridges as well--with EVERY PRINT--for two reasons, given by an HP representative on their customer support webpage. The first reason is that the ink flow prevents the cartridge from plugging up.  The second reason is to provide a high-quality black print.  So, the entire time you're using it, you're using the much more expensive colored inks, whether you want to or not.  This is supposed to be one of the cheapest printers per page on the market.  Not sure if that's entirely true.2).  This printer WILL NOT PRINT when the color ink cartridges are empty.  WILL NOT.  In fact, if just ONE cartridge is empty you can't.  You can't just keep an empty color cartridge in there and print using just the black ink.  It won't let you.  Not until you replace the color cartridge.  And when does it warn you about this occurring?  WHEN it occurs.  No advanced warning that cartridges are running low.  So there you are, late on a Sunday night, you have a paper due in the morning and you CANNOT print it.  You're screwed.  Thanks, HP.Here's a link to the HP Customer support conversation that was most, hmm, helpful to me in understanding just how deep the crap is that I'm standing in and that HP dishes out.http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printer-All-in-One-Install-Setup-e-g-Windows-8/do-i-have-to-buy-color-ink-cartridges-HP-Officejet-Pro-8600/td-p/1706711",

Before buying, I checked with Consumer Reports and found that this was the highest rated &#34;ink jet&#34; combo printer on their website. I found a back-to-school bundle special offered thru Wal-Mart, and with the Site-To-Store option, I picked up the printer in less than a week and saved quite a bit from the Consumer Reports approximate retail selling price. I really like the fact that the printer has automatic 2-sided printing, a separate 4x6 photo tray, is capable of e-print from my phone, document feeder and flat bed scanning/copying, and also individual ink cartridges. The 7520 does take a little time to set up, but will be well worth it.et-up for home use was a bit of a hassle until I decided to start over with the process. Apparently, I'd opened the fold-out control panel too far. Restowing it and reopening it 'fixed' the issue. Since then I've used some of the machine's capacity, including scanning, copying and printing regularly. Used the ePrint process once without a problem. Nice feature if you don't mind leaving your printer on fulltime. Similarly, you can subscribe to free services and receive regular faxes. Haven't had to replace any ink cartridges yet.

Now my wife's laptop uses it and my PC uses it and both were a snap to setup. It also prints almost as soon as I select a print job unlike my last All-In-One from HP. It is quiet and it is fast. I have also used the double sided copy and 20 some pages plus copied both front and back without a hitch. I have printed color also and it looks great. This is a powerhouse printer for a Mom & Pop office or for your home use. Medium to large offices should go with a much larger version I would think. So far I give this thing a 5 star rating. The one drawback I see is the paper tray. You cannot load glossy paper at the same time you load regular paper. You must load one type or the other and the same goes for envelopes. They have made that process very simple to do so for me that isn't really a drawback but for others it might be.,

Previous HP models allowed you to disable this sleep feature, but this model only lets you extend the period to 15 minutes, and there's no sign that HP is going to fix this. It turns your otherwise fabulous wireless printer into a massive brick that only works when you connect directly. Don't even get me started on how awful trying to get the software installed was, or how it STILL refuses to work on one on my windows 7 laptops. The only solution is to either print constantly, or write a script that runs in the background of your PC that 'pings' your printer every few minutes, which significantly reduces the lifespan of your printer. Even giving it a static IP bound to it's MAC address in my wireless router settings doesn't fix the issue.I chose this printer because it has a good cost-per-page for black and white pages, but given all the headaches I've had thus far just trying to get it to print it all, HP has lost me as a customer. This is a gigantic piece of garbage and I hope I've saved at least 1 person the pain of having to deal with it.",

I needed to print several binders full of color information before a trade show, and also scan a bunch of other documents.  This printer has been great because it's super easy to set up, it prints quickly, the print quality is great for business printing (presentations, spreadsheets, etc), it prints double sided, and it scans double sided.Overall, this is the absolute best home office printer I have ever interacted with and it's surprising to me the quality you can get at home after using only industrial sized office machines for years.  If you need to have a regular printer for every day printing and the occasional large print job, this will be perfect for you.  My large color binders were done in no time last week and looked great, and I think my team was pretty happy with the results.  Also, the cost per page of ink is not too bad.I think this printer is not for you if you print very rarely (go with something cheaper and smaller) or if you have a mini print shop and are printing more than 200 pages daily...

You cannot print ANYTHING if any of the print cartridges are empty!  I've attempted to print in draft mode, black only and I STILL can't print!  The manual has a section for 'how to print with one or more depleted ink cartridges' and all it says is that you must replace them!  Yes, the ink consumption is not bad, probably slightly better than most other printers, but if you are caught on a saturday night and want to print out those movie tickets you purchased online, but don't have a spare yellow lying around, you can't print them!The scanner is set to the lowest resolution possible, and it STILL takes 6 minutes to scan 5 pages! (one side only!)  This is simply NOT acceptable!  The auto feed is fairly limited in the number of pages that can be scanned at one time.  If you have more than 6-8 pages, the document feeder has a tendency to skew the pages and rip the edges as they are fed through.  That's a problem for me.  If I'm taking the (extremely) long time to scan a document, its probably important to me and I don't want it shredded by the time its finished.My boss thought he was doing me a favor when he picked up a newer version of this model for me to use at work.  He was so excited about it, I didn't have the heart to tell him that he'd wasted the money.  These are absolute junk!!  The print quality is standard; not great but not bad either.

However, my unit typically has problems picking up photo paper or card stock (both HP-brand, no less). I would think twice about buying this model if you intend to print pictures or homemade greeting cards.* Envelope printing is a train wreck. Just forget it. Even standard #10 business envelopes require such a wide left margin that the printed envelope looks terrible. HP needs to improve its drivers, but that will likely never happen, of course. My solution? I have to keep an old HP DeskJet 6940 connected to use as a dedicated envelope printer. Thanks so much, HP.* If you want to use the printer with Linux, good luck. I have had little success, even with the latest hplip download. It's fine for printing standard 8.5 x 11 pages. Forget scanning, and scan-to-computer isn't even an option.

We replaced the ink and it happened again within days. We called HP, they sent us a replacement print head. After installing it, the same problem kept occurring. They then sent us a whole new unit (but would not, of course, reimburse the cost of the many ink cartridges we had gone through). New unit arrived, worked for a little while, then ink began to magically run out again (only the yellow). At this point, we would replace the ink, then we finally gave up on the printer and only used it for black/white copying and document printing. A year after having the new unit with minimal usage, we tried to print a picture and magically, the yellow cartridge was once again empty! Even though we hadn't used it. We are now done with HP products forever. This has been a nightmare. 3 printers in a row of the same make/model that don't work. Obviously, there are some serious issues with this model. If you actually own one that works, consider yourself one of the lucky!",
259,XX,B005O55U2Y,2,0,0,13-May-13,A1IJV9VWEN71TE,So disappointed,"I purchased this from Costco this weekend (not Amazon).I'm so disappointed. I have an Etsy shop that I need clear vibrant prints for. I could never sell what comes out of this printer. The colors are very flat/muted/not crisp. I would not even use this for fliers as it is not a professional quality. If HP is going to have a Office printer with color you'd think they would make one that prints professional quality. The B&W printer prints a crisper black. And forget printing photos!!! I tried adjusting the colors in my graphics, I tried adjusting the settings (I even printed on 'best' quality. with his resolution).I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because it is fast and didn't have problems feeding the photo paper.",
260,XX,B005O55U2Y,2,1,1,12-May-13,A2F9J2BA7IGPVM,Will not print custom size paper,This printer and apparently other newer HP printers only allow you to print preset sizes. You can create your own custom size within Word for Mac for instance but the HP print dialog box greys out the custom sizes and does not allow you to print them.  I spent 4 hours looking in HPs forums for an answer then spent an hour on the phone with HP and never got a solution. I later found posts from HP employees saying their printers don't support custom sizes.  What a waste of time.,

I like that the scanner bed allows for legal size paper, and that it has two sizes (regular and XL cartridges). I like to use the XL cartridges so I don't have to change the ink cartridges as often.The only &#34;negative&#34; comment is that the FAX speed dial - which I used a lot - only allows for scrolling thru the list and there is no faster alternative as with the HP 8500, but am getting used to it - so it bothers me less and less",

Dealing with the HP tech support was an absolute nightmare with repeated calls and each new tech making you go through the same maddening checklist. FINALLY got someone who knew what they were doing and they will replace it because of some modem malfunction in the fax part. I even had to pay for the phone company to come out and check the line (which is a dedicated line specifically for the fax) even though I insisted that we plugged in my regular phone and it worked perfectly. It was still under warranty but I will only get a 'refurbished' replacement that they said 'should work like new.' The phone guy said not to plug the phone line from the machine back into the line because it might damage the line. However, the tech and tech supervisors refused to replace the machine until they performed the exact steps the prior techs performed and said they were sorry but could not pay for another service call as well. What a joke!!!!! Two service calls equals the price of a new machine and now I get a 'refurbished' machine for all of my expense and trouble. I hope this is only a fluke thing, but you should be aware of how hard it is to deal with tech support with issues with your machine.",

I really like the onscreen touchpad and the ease of use.  It has the capability of double-siding, which is pretty cool.  One thing that may be a downside is the cost of ink.  Will have to see how this weighs out with my older HP's.  It came with a trial pack, and so far I've printed off a ream of paper (500 pages)... and I also use the fast or draft mode to save on ink too.  I also like the wireless option with my various computers on the network.  And you can print from your smart phone.  So, a pretty decent printer!",

A great price, what the printer said it could do, and some positive review research made me decide to give it a go.  I am very happy I did!  I easily set it up for wireless printing for my PC, iPad and Windows Surface table PC. Hard wired printing is faster, and another option. Being able to fax, scan and copy are great. The auxiliary USB and SDHC ports are very useful.  The ink has lasted very well, and replacement ink is the cheapest of all the major brands.

Large individual cartridges.Definitely one of my favorite functionality is Scan-to-email and Print-to-email. No need to install the full HP software suite on your computer to benefit from the scanning function; all you need is a ISP-provided email account, and you will use their SMTP server to email to yourself documents that you scan, just like you would on a $15,000 copier.Touch screen is nice, not the fastest, but functional enough to use for regular tasks.WiFi setup can be troublesome, but most of the time, manually entering the SSID instead of selecting it from the list solves the problem.Hefty size, but considering it is wireless, you don't need to have it right next to your computer.",

279,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,9,10,10-Apr-13,A1DW6OO38WSSVB,Cannot print at all when one ink cartridge runs out,I am very disappointed to find out that this printer 'is engineered to stop functioning and request ink when a cartridge is low' (per HP support).  You cannot print in black and white nor in greyscale.  When you run out of just one color cartridge you are dead in the water until you buy a new one.What is even worse is the user's guide says you CAN print in greyscale when a cartridge is out.  This was a VERY IMPORTANT point in my buying decision since I mostly print black and white.  However after going through the HP support forums it is now very obvious the user guide is intentionally misleading and incorrect.Very poor engineering decision IMHO.,

282,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,0,0,5-Apr-13,A250WAF08HY1QE,"Good, but no better than 8500 Officejet Pro","If I could get a new 8500 Pro series, which has given us over 96,000 full prints thus far, only on its second print head - I would trade in my new 8600 Pro Plus hands down. We still use our 8500 Pro and love it more than our 8600 so far.This review is to add some insight into the networking issues with the new 8600 series. We are an all apple computer office, with exception to our router being linksys e4000. If we have to power down our router, the 8600 printer all the sudden starts going super slow motion, in that 10 prints in the que will take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour to print. This is definitely an HP issue with networking and mac computers. To resolve this issue, we have to shut off the HP 8600, remove the printer on each machine, power back on the printer, then read it to each computer. I am not a networking guy, so I'm sure there is an explanation for this bug or phenomenon, but the 8500 has never ever had that problem. In fact the 8500 has well over 96,000 prints and is just like it was new. We only now print to the 8600 when we have to.So besides the networking issue with the 8600 series and apple computer (not sure on windows machines), the only other real complaint is the awkward paper loading tray. The 8500 gives you a nice upward slant to EASILY put paper in. The 8600 is a straight only pull out tray, cumbersome at best - poor design on that part for sure.The only reason we bought an 8600 is because the 8500 was no longer available new, and we were waiting for HP to ship our new print heads for the 8500.So, long story short, the 8500 is still our best printer, while the 8600 has issues, is now the lesser of our two printers and it seems that HP cheated on the ink supply with the 8600 as we are filling them more often the the 8500 and we print more with the 8500 at the same resolutions, dpi, quality, paper, etc.HP must have some way they are pinching pennies putting on a new shell with a few bells and whistles for the 8600 series, as we find it no better than 8500 and we are happy still in our 3rd year with the 8500 at the 96,000 + prints it just keeps on going.",

The directions supplied by HP for installation are NOT accurate, and once again HP refuses to accept that fact.

I am just now about to replace the ink cartridges after owning it for over a year.  I would recommend this machine to anyone who's looking for a printer that does everything.  One of my favorite features is the duplex (front/back) printing.  It will even allow you to choose black ink only if some of the color inks are out.  You can get a great deal on ink cartridges, too, at the HP Home website as they send you coupons, and if you're signed up with Ebates, you get money back there, too.

Wow! starter cartridges worked for a good while. We don't print a massive amount though. Now the printer works awesome in all ways.... But the printer is now not working. Printhead failure or printer failure. Either way HP is sending me a Re- Certified machine???? Hmmm I had to go through service tech, hardware supervisor, then corporate complaint. I was treated fair but I'm an IT professional and will not accept any guff from telephone call center types. They told me I would receive a re-conditioned unit, I asked them what that is.... a refurbished unit?? They said no they do not repair them anymore, not cost effective. The re-conditioned unit is a new printer that was sold to a retailer or wholesaler that was returned new for credit. They stated its the law that unit cannot be sold as new again..... Hmmm I will have to look into that..... The jury is still out but HP corp complaints division stated they would get the printer to me in by Tuesday and its Friday at 4 pm now, so we will see. He also stated I would have a full 2 year warranty on the re-conditioned machine. Their definition: re-conditioned is a product returned for credit new but has been tested and certified and reboxed in a plain box and utilized  for warranty. I hope HP doesn't let me down on this.",

289,XX,B005O55U2Y,2,2,5,25-Mar-13,AP45IMO1GFY2W,Very FRUSTRATING,"I have owned this troublesome printer for a less than a month.  I have contacted Customer Support (and I use the term support generously) 5 times.1)  The printer cannot stay installed for more than a week to 10 days.  When I go to my handy dandy HP assistant, it is not there, the option to install is there... only it will not completely install.  Four times HP has remotely uninstalled, downloaded the full featured drivers from their website and reinstalled.  Each time they state the last tech support person must have only installed the basic drivers.  The printer will work fine... for a while.  2)  Then the printer started stalling in the middle of printing and randomly spitting out blank pages at the end of the print.  I called HP for the third or fourth time.  When I went into my HP assitant to explain the other things that I had done to solve these problems, my assitant was gone AGAIN.  Then I had to explain to Robin that I am NOT a fool.  I did NOT click on some setup.exe file, I clicked on the very same icon that I always use to find my ink levels etc.  This has been the most troublesome printer that I have ever owned.  And if I did not already have $500 in ink to use up, that thing would already be returned to the store!  Do not purchase this printer, it is not worth the headache!  And if you are wondering why I would have $500 in ink, that is also a pain in the but with this printer.  Even if what you are printing is all black ink and you have a full black cartridge, it will not print properly if one of the color ones are empty.  So when it tricked me by working for 10 straight days I purchased 2 XL of each color and black ink.  I foolishly opened them and put them in the sealed container I use to store my extra ink because the boxes do not fit neatly into that space.  As for Customer Support... well that's just a joke.  They are always experiencing 'higher than normal calls at this time' well I can see why!!!!  I did accidentally get their online chat support one time, I wish it was more clear how to do that directly.  I clicked on it while registering the printer.  I actually got the tech support for icloud and he transfered me. It is very difficult to speak to someone with a language barrier on the phone!  I wish that they had a direct online chat support.  It must exist, but when I attempt to go through their website, it does not recognize 'HP Officeject Pro 8600 Plus'.  Their option to 'search my device' did not work.  Perhaps that is because the thing will not remain installed.Oh, and the quality is not great.  I can only print graphs and such on 'draft' because on normal they get smeared by the third page.  I then have to through the cleaning process that eats up a lot of ink.  I purchased this computer specifically to print out pie charts and graphic presentations.  I had an HP Photosmart 4700 and upgraded because I wanted better quality on my projects, specifically the colors.  I should have stayed with it.  The 8600 does not print on cardstock well.  I've followed all of the tips, and I can nurse it along to make a copy, but it is crushed at the top.  I have also found that the ADF will crush the original, so I have to do that manually.  The ONLY thing that I have found this printer to be able to do that it says it will with any regularity is the dual sided automatic copy.  That is amazing and the only reason it got two stars.",

I struggled with this multiple times until I found a work around solution someone shared online.Btw I was using Windows 7 Pro 64 bit and  (Word 2010-- in Office Professional 32-bit) and this HP 8600 Plus with the single slide in tray.How I printed a single number 10 envelope on my HP 8600 Plus printer...-Using a regular new document not produced under the every nonfunctional Mailings -heading--Use landscape orientation under the Page Layout, then in the Size option and choose Envelope# 10-Type in your Return address and To address like you want to see it printed on the envelope.-When I asked to print, a message came up that the copy was 'outside the margins' so I had to adjust the left edge of the return address a bit to line up on the envelope. The message `outside the margins' still comes up but it printed ok.  Return address is not as high as I would have preferred but it is still ok.Note that you have to take all your standard size paper out of the tray and load with some #10 envelopes. Tighten the tabs, that will hold the envelopes face down in the middle of the tray.After you print be sure and reload your paper tray with regular paper.What a pain!Another thing is that you had better have the expensive backup ink cartridges (both the three color ones and black one) on hand quickly after you get a notice that your ink is low because when the ink runs out it stops abruptly.  That is a pain too. Other than these things so far after 6 months of pretty heavy use I've been pleased with this printer. I have always had HP printers because I was pleased with their service. Sadly my service experiences with this printer have not been good, Multiple times I was kept on the line for extremely long times while foreign service reps seemed to be reading me useless rhetoric.  One call was setting up my fax and I made multiple calls trying to print these single envelopes.If you can set the printer to print front and back sides of your paper to save on paper and you can also set to print with black ink only to save on the color ink cartridges.There are things I wish I understood better like do I have to change out all the colors when one of the colors runs out? If anyone knows let me know and please if you know an easier way to print envelopes let me know. Any other tips appreciated too.Hope this helps someone else.",

294,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,0,0,16-Mar-13,A28YD4NMUEXV47,Great printer except for envelopes,"Very pleased with this HP Officejet Pro 8600 Plus printer.  Biggest shortcoming is in printing envelopes.  Fortunately, I have an old HP Deskjet that I can use to print envelopes. Windows 7 does not allow me to change printers for envelopes.  I must first start the regular print process for full sheet printing, change printers, cancel the printing, print the envelopes with the old printer, and then change the printer choice back to the 8600 plus. This takes about the same time as removing the paper from the 8600 paper tray, putting in the envelopes, printing them, and then replacing the paper in the tray. But, I can do it all from the keyboard if the envelopes are already loaded in the old printer. Although the 8600 is much faster than the old printer, the old printer prints envelopes with reasonable speed. I had trouble with envelopes because I was placing the envelopes on the right side of the tray as I did on my old HP printer. If the envelope is placed in the middle of the tray, it can be placed on top of the paper in the tray, and it works fine.  If you have a stack of envelopes, you can take the paper out, and keep the stack of envelopes in the middle of the tray by moving in the width adjustments. I have decided to give the 8600 Plus 5 stars. XL print cartridges are quite expensive, but they print so many pages that the cost per page is the cheapest of any printer that I know of. I like the wireless feature, as I can print from my cell phone and another network computer. Setup was easy. It had to be for an 86 year old who is not too computer savvy.",
295,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,0,0,15-Mar-13,A3FCC8GUATNX66,Great all in one printer - scanning software lacks features of some of the older HP models,"This is a great all-in-one printer. I purchased it with the double side printing option. It has worked well with no jams to date. The feeder also works well. Setup was a bit complicated, but made easy by the online, on screen help. Considering all the features, it was a breeze. The software for scanning on my old C7280 was much better. It allowed for scanning multiple photos and self identified each one, storing as a separate file. It also auto-cropped a single picture. The software for this 8600 doesn't appear to have these features. The scan resolution is a bit difficult to change and also doesn't have as many choices as the C7280. I'm going to attempt to load the software back on from the C7280 and see if it will recognize and use the 8600. If you're not doing a lot of photo scanning, then this wouldn't be a big deal. The copy feature is simple, as it should be. I haven't faxed through it yet. Like most, faxing is not seldom needed in our more digital world. Just scan your docs and email them.

I print out about a hundred pages of articles per week.  This printer makes double-sided printing a snap.  It prints fairly quickly.  It also makes nice copies.  I find the scanner much less user-friendly, but I rarely need to use it so I don't care much.  I've never used the fax portion.Setting it up was a snap since it's wireless.  You basically just push a button and it talks to your computer and they figure it out for you.

You just send an email with your document as an attachment, from anywhere and any computer, and it prints.  Initial setup of the machine was really easy.It's not small, and it's kinda loud, but those are really the only things I could say about it that aren't 100% positive.  I did have an issue where a double-sided document I printed wasn't exactly lined up on the back side (the top got cut off) but I'm not sure if that was the printer's issue or mine.I haven't tried printing any high-quality photos on photo paper, so I can't say anything about how well it does that.

Reading the HP website confirmed this. I had requested a return slip from the seller (which they supplied) when a friend told me there was a link to a new istall that supported the printer on another part of the HP site. An example, I found two completely different HP web pages with instructions for setting up the wireless printing connection for the printer. One did not result in the correct setup.

I'll just print in black only.  However, I started getting these stupid pop-up messages on my computer saying I need to order more Magenta ink online from HP.  These windows would pop-up repeatedly through out the day, even if I haven't printed in a week.  For two weeks, I never printed in anything other than Black.  Then today when I booted up my computer, I get a message saying that I need to install new ink NOW! and my printer will be unable to function until I get new magenta ink. Keep in mind that I just want to print in black.So, here it is in a nutshell.  HP puts spyware on your computer to track your ink usage.  I didn't buy Magenta ink fast enough (within about two weeks) for their liking so their Nazi software disabled my printer--holding it hostage until I buy magenta.  It was working fine until their software decided that NO you can't just print in black only.  You need to give HP more money now or else!I had important papers to print for a meeting tomorrow so I was forced to go get the Magenta to break my printer out of jail.  As soon as I installed the Magenta, I could print my important papers in black once again.  I even got an annoying pop-up thanking me for purchasing Genuine Magenta Ink from HP.This is all a scam.  Those ink cartridges are expensive and HP wants you to buy as many as possible.  Buy two sets and you could just buy a new printer for the cost.  Thats how they make their money.  So they put this software in there to keep track of how long ago your ran out of magenta.  After a certain period of time, they just disable the printer to force you do buy it from them--even if you don't need friggen magenta.All I have to say is this: F-you HP.  Never again.Don't buy this product from these scam artists.  Don't financially support companies that do these kind of shady practices and install invasive spyware on your computer, keeping track of your behavior, just so they and nickle and dime you to death.",

Good quality printing, the scanner and copier were easy to use and worked well. I occasionally used the fax, and that seemed to be fine. Everything was great until one day the printer stopped working. It turns on, but every print job results in messages about a paper jam, and removing the back paper feeder and following a seemingly endless set of instructions.That would be o.k. occasionally; printers jam, right ? But following the instructions never actually achieves anything. So I went to the HP support site and entered a plea for help. Three weeks later I have not had a response, which I find very disappointing.Up until then I really liked the printer; it's in my home 'office' and I print work and personal documents, it printed from our iPads, my Mac and Windows laptops. The ability to scan to a PDF on my personal computer was helpful. If only the printer were more reliable (i.e. it still worked) I'd be one happy camper.As it is, I give it one star because a) it doesn't work and b) HP's support is dreadful.Next stop, back to the shop and hope that they are interested enough to help.",

I attempted to purchase the part on-line but could not find it anywhere. I talked with 4 people at HP and an HP rep at Best Buy.  HP had the printhead for $100 but did not recommend purchase because they could not guarantee it would fix the problem.  The best they could offer was to have me buy the SAME printer again but this time they agreed to give me a 2 year warranty.  Spending another $220 for the same printer after only one year, even with a 2 year warranty this time, is ridiculous.  If I have to buy another printer, it won't be HP as they don't stand behind their products. And the customer service was terrible.  I could barely understand 2/4 people I spoke with on the phone.  when I mentioned this to the HP Best Buy rep, he said next time I should ask for their Canada division.

324,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,1,2,19-Feb-13,A36FVWI5DCE8E5,"So far, so good","I have read both positive and negative reviews on this site and others.  So far, I am on the 'very happy' side.  Some people knock the quality but quite frankly for the price I paid at a local store the performance is, to this point, exceeding my expectations.  Some people didn't like that you had to remove paper to put in special paper, envelopes, etc.  Again, for this price range I do not see that as a standard expectation.  I LOVE the auto-two-sided print option.  Most of my work is as a consultant and my primary clients are at a distance so most of what I print for work is for my own review and use so being able to conveniently and quickly set this printer up to print two-to a page, double sided as the default was very welcome.  My last printer, a very lousy Lexmark product not only required manually flipping the paper but also wasted paper by printing out an extra sheet after a '2-sided' print request on how to flip and reinsert the paper to get a book print setup final product...EVERY time...was very inefficient and much slower than this machine.  I also keep my print quality defaulted to low-quality as most of my stuff is for draft...still is very clear and easy to read.  I will use it for photos and graphics to a point but primarily wanted a straight-up work printer with high functionality, efficiency, and ease of use so for me, this is a great printer. I don't currently need much of the wireless capability but expect that to change so am glad this machine has this feature.

The real cost of printing is the cost of ink cartridges, not the printer.  Unfortunately, this printer uses colored ink even when you're printing black & white.  You can't turn the color ink usage off.  The rationale is that using color ink improves black and white print quality, and keeps the ink flowing smoothly.  Once one of your color cartridges is depleted the printer just flat stops printing--black & white, or in any color--until you replace the depleted color cartridge.  And, the color ink cartridges are very pricey.  Bleeding down the color ink every time you print black & white seems like a major design flaw to me, and they certainly don't tell you about it up front.  I do most of my printing in black & white and use color very rarely because of the cost.  I need a printer that's economical to operate, so I'll be replacing this one.",

As of about 2 weeks ago (March, 2014) it's quit working altogether.I've had issues on and off with it since I bought it. The main problem was that it would randomly give me a &#34;Paper Jam&#34; error message when there was no paper jam to be found. I would contact HP Support and they would walk me through whatever steps and it would usually resolve the issue.A few weeks ago, it gave me that stupid message out of nowhere, I went through all the steps HP Support had previously walked me through, and none of them worked. I unplugged it, left it for about 3 days, and then plugged it in again and...IT WORKED! Well, for about 1 minute. After printing one page, it gave me a &#34;Load Paper&#34; error message. I checked, and the tray had plenty of paper in it. I fiddled with it for a bit, and it began feeding the paper only to jam (for real this time). I cleared the jam and tried again. I could hear the paper feeding, then the crunching of it being wrinkled in the feeder. Another actual paper jam.So now, I'm getting a load paper error when there is an actual paper jam and a tray full of paper. I have no idea how to fix it, it's out of warranty and I'm stuck with a $220 machine and another $170 worth of XL ink cartridges that are all totally useless.I've contacted HP support about this (again) and hopefully will get somewhere with them this time.If you want to buy this machine, go for it, just be prepared to have weekly or monthly conversations with HP Support, and put back the $ to buy another one when warranty expires.",

I had a little trouble setting up the web apps, I called HP support they referred me once to a higher level of support. the guy advised to add HP's DNS servers to the settings on the Printer and wallah the web apps connected and worked great. The last time I utilized HP support about 5 years ago, I was very disappointed with the crappy service, but this was nice. I recommend the Printer. PS: iPrint WORKS GREAT WITH MY APPLE PRODUCTS, A VERY BIG PLUS!!!",

350,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,0,0,7-Feb-13,A2CGY3TPBDJQXA,Exceeded my expectations,"Other home network printers I have purchased (won't name names) have been noisy, unreliable, cannot handle large print jobs without chewing up paper, go through ink cartridges like crazy, and are difficult to load paper into.  This printer is QUIET (not one of my &#34;must haves&#34; but definitely a PLUS), prints 2 sided without a lot of extra effort, feeds paper flawlessly.  I have yet to run out of ink, but it seems to be stingy on ink usage and pricing cartridges at the local office supply store, they are ~25% less expensive than the ones I had been buying.We had 2 older network printers and both are GONE!  Highly recommend the HP Officejet Pro!",
351,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,3,4,7-Feb-13,A2SR9M2CWC2OCP,Just what we needed,"This year, we purchased two rental properties and found ourselves going through mounds of paper just in the purchase process and then another mound of paper in lease signing and correspondence. Our old printer started to strain under the increased demand, it wasn't designed to handle that much usage. I spent a couple of days researching printers: reading reviews and articles. Most printers had similar features but we needed three key features: wireless connection, sheet feeder for copying/scanning and duplex printing. Those features limited our choices of printers and forced us to spend quite a bit more. After going through reviews I chose this printer over a similar Cannon model. Sorry, but I don't have my notes to recall what the key factor but I suspect it was purely price.The printer was easy to install and works flawlessly in wireless mode. I haven't attempted to use it from my ancient Macbook which I use for casual use. We only print from our PC based desktop computers both running Windows 7.I enjoy scanning with this printer, previous scanners and multifunction printers required so much more back and forth to scan in a document, with this printer you can scan directly into your computer from the printer control panel. If your computer is in the other room, you can bring the document to the scanner, put it in the sheet feeder, start the scan and it will automatically go to your computer back to your desk. This little device has saved me a lot of time scanning in lengthy documents.Many of the reviews stated that the sheet feeder for copying and scanning is fickle but I only have problems with it when putting previously folded documents through the sheet feeder. If I take a moment to flatten the creases before I attempt to feed it through, they feed just fine. Papers that have never been folded or otherwise mangled buzz through the sheet feeder for copying or scanning with ease, much better than I expected. I haven't tried to sheet feed odd sized documents, just several regular paper sized documents.The printer goes in and out of sleep mode with ease also. It turns itself back on and readies itself after power outages also. When you need to print, there is not a lengthy pause for it to wake up and start printing. When I need to scan, similar quick response. Only one blue light remains lit in sleep mode, so I assume its power drain is minimal in sleep mode.I use online deposit function with my bank. My bank and the scanner function of this printer got along fine from their first date and have a rock solid relationship. I didn't have to do anything, they just found each other, shook hands, and exchanged data from my first attempt. I was expecting to have to do something but I guess they were made for each other.Overall, I'm very happy with this printer. We found a slightly better deal on another site than Amazon, otherwise we would have preferred to buy it here. We've had it for since Mid December 2012.I'm a frequent Amazon purchaser and prefer to put my reviews here. I will most likely update this review next winter.",

353,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,1,2,5-Feb-13,A2OZDCVI28W2ZR,Excellent Printer,"I bought this printer about a month ago and so far everything works great. The only thing I have been unable to get to work is the 'scan to (computer) folder' option on the keypad, but I can still scan to computer so that is not a big issue. Since I own a HP computer I know that calling their tech support is time consuming and useless. After seeing all the negative reviews I was very reluctant to buy the printer. After finally deciding to do it anyway, I purchased it from Best Buy rather than on line, and bought the 2 year extended warranty. This way if anything goes wrong, they will replace it with a new one instead of a refurbised one from HP, and if the model has been discontinued they will replace it with the newer model. I rarely buy these warranties, but in this case I considered a good investment.",

I print a lot of scripts. But I also liked the idea of having access to color, and the reviews were positive. It has not disappointed. Text pages come out quickly and quietly, and are crisp. Ink usage is acceptable. After several reams I'm still on my starter black cartridge. Touchscreen interface is easy to use, PC driver is fine, and scanner is quick and easy. I have had no problems with the wireless connection. Photos are pretty nice, too, not quite as vibrant or sharp as what you could get with a photo printer, but just fine for casual use.

After 4 different printers in 2 weeks (each one lasted less than 3 days before problems arose), we have given up on HP for our business. We quit buying HP printers a few years ago because of quality problems. We let ourselves be talked back into trying their new 'top of the line' 8600. The first one had scanning/faxing problems after about 2 days (a line down the middle of the page). The second printer had the same exact problem. The third printer could not successfully set up because of print head issues and the forth started squeaking loudly after about 2 days. 4 new printers, four bad fails...Needless to say we are looking into other printers and definitely NOT HP. To their credit they replaced them as they failed, but holy cow... 4 for 4 ! We stopped the loss there when they offered to send the 5th printer out. HP quality used to be the best, but our experience the last few years puts them way down the list. A few years ago I wouldn't look at any other brand for a printer. Now I will no longer look at HP.",

I print about 1 color page for every 500 or 1000 black and white pages, yet it continually uses color ink to keep the print head clean. So for me the cost of printing a color copy is about $20 and B & W costs have just went up exponentially.  Totally worthless piece of crap design flaw. I REFUSE to buy color ink I won't use just to be able to print black and white copies. Tomorrow, I will replace it with a faster lazer Brother with a toner cost of about 1/5 of this inkjet.

If I were to order another, I could cut my start up time down to five minutes--it's that easy! The first time to print, I used my iPad. It was amazing! The print quality is clear and crisp. I keep the printer in another room from my modem and it has not problem with the wireless connection. I have only used the print feature in this all-in-one, but so far, I feel it is money well spent.

I have had the printer a few years now and every time I have to refill the paper, I just think that the designer should be reassigned.  Sure, it is pretty but not functional.  You cant see how much paper you have.  It clanks and is clumsy when you pull in out.  It gets caught up when inserted or removed.  When I shift to envelop it is like playing with a cheap toy manufacturer in Taiwan.  The printer itself is good and the touch screen is so far doing well.  Hope HP does a better job with the paper tray next time and heck, while their at it, has all manufacturing moved back to the United States.  Paper Tray gets a '0' and printer itself gets a '5'",

When the printer goes into sleep mode, it disables the wireless connection. You can not send a print job and have the printer wake up. This is a major flaw.

The scanner feeder works well too, and is a bonus when scanning multiple pages.We bought this printer to replace another inkjet all-in-one because ink was costing us $$$$.  We originally planned to buy a color laser all-in-one, but after shopping around and comparing all the costs (replacing toner + imager vs. ink) and checking reviews, we chose this model.  We were not sure if we were getting back &#34;into the ink business&#34; again.  We have been very pleasantly surprised, and are still running the original ink cartridges.

My work had nice laserjets but I wanted to wait to get an all-in-one printer until my other one died.  Now, I really wonder why I was torturing myself!There is no need to have a separate scanner or copier when you've got this printer.  It prints/scans/copies in duplex mode and you don't even have to be next to it or connected directly.  Printing is pretty fast compared to other, similar models.  Scanning is high quality; however, it works a little better on the flatbed than using the autofeed (sometimes comes out crooked with the autofeed).  I like the ability to print remotely from my work or mobile device.  Setup was a cinch and, while it is large, it doesn't seem to take up that much space (compact on all ends without anything extending outward from the base figure).I am completely content.  I haven't had any problems yet except for a few jams when I fed paper to scan into the autofeed that had rips on some of the edges---my fault, nothing to gripe about the printer.",

Looked at the reviews, and decided to purchase this one. Shipped in a big box, arrived on time and in once piece. Uber-easy to set up, just follow the quick-start guide and you're done in just a few minutes. Took me longer to unpack than it did to get it up and running. The ability to copy/fax/print/scan 14 inch legal size pages is WONDERFUL. The print quality, either for documents or photos is very good. The front control is simple to understand and use. The single tray holds about 200 + sheets of paper, which is good. Bought it for a good price (on sale) on Amazon. What's not to like. The ink that it shipped with lasted about 2 months, and I'm a fairly heavy user. Just be prepared to spend about $100. for the replacement XL size cartridges, all 4 of them.

The problem is with the automatic feeder, it starts the pages off, but then the rollers sit there spinning while the page is stuck and so the scanner is still scanning and you end up with a stretched out copy on your scan. I contactacted support and they tell me the warrenty has expired. So all they have to do is take a long time to ship it and your warrenty expires, because they use the date when the order was placed, not when it arrives or even when it was shipped.

Problems:  1. the touch screen is not always responsive.  Takes a delicate touch that seems to vary.  2.  If touch screen isn't responding, there is no way to access any of the features or functions.  3.  Feeder from the paper tray doesn't function well.  Even with optimally loaded 20-24 lb. papers it will jam frequently. Often does not feed envelopes or labels, just 'ignores' them. Plus, it has a really, really hard time with card stock (anything from 60-85 lb. is nearly impossible to print on, so forget about greeting cards or photos).  On previous models you could manually assist the feed to get it to take heavier paper.  On this model you cannot access the paper tray during printing, so you have no way to 'help' the feed.  Result, lots of paper jams, lots of wasted paper and lots of cursing.  4. The display frequently says there is a missing ink cartridge (when they are full and properly loaded), but there is only one way to access the cartridges, and that is by opening the front panel, but that does not work.  The only way to access the cartridges is if a cartridge is truly empty, then opening the panel works.  But for dealing with these frequent erroneous messages there is no way to resume function except to reboot the printer, which is a time-consuming process.  Result:  more cursing.  Sometimes that doesn't work either and you have to reboot your computer, too. 5. Printing of multiple pages of a single document is fast, BUT uploading to the printer is not.  There is a long delay in scanning a copy and in printing from computer. If you want to copy or print one or two copies of anything, which I do stacks of frequently, this makes the process SLOW. I  We have owned HP MFPs for over 20 years, and have an old HP LaserJet 2300 PC L6 that is still functioning perfectly after many years.

395,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,1,1,11-Dec-12,A3C1PA0CPAJUXC,Please stop me before I buy HP wireless printers again,"So I always seem to buy into HP printers because of their price point and features.  I do hope I never do this again. The printers always seem to work for awhile and then suddenly, for no reason, the wireless connections stop working. This time, the printer stopped working with all the MACs in the house.  It does work with the Windows OS after restarting the router.  I did get HP Total Care support and I've gotten very nice and very helpful technicians, but once they cannot resolve the problem (after hours of troubleshooting and time I will never, ever get back), they deny it's their problem and send you to places like your router vendor (who won't talk with you), your internet service provider who just laughs that HP says it's a router problem, and Apple Support whom unless you bought the printer from them and have Apple Care, won't talk to you.  Even though I bought the extended warranty,  I actually had an HP corporate case manager who told me he wasn't technical, tell me it couldn't possibly be a problem with the printer and he refused to swap out the printer.  Ah, technology.",
396,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,5,6,11-Dec-12,AG7DD2B3QML3L,Great features...if it doesn't break on you!,"I bought this printer because my mother uses a similar one for her business.  Yes, quite a few of them have broken down on her, but when they work they are great.  She buys the extended no-questions-asked warranty from Office Depot which she has had to use many times.  I figured that it comes with a one-year warranty, so as long as it would last the year, I would be happy.  Less than 6 months later, the printer ink carriage is immobile and nothing will work on the printer now, not even the scan feature.  I haven't even printed one full ream of paper yet or changed the ink!  I don't understand how a company can make such a great featured product with the same weak point, year after year.  Yes, this was the same thing that always broke for my mother, too.The main reason why I give this product a one-star rating is because I went to HP's website to fill out the warranty information and they said that my warranty expired after 84 days of purchasing/registering the printer!  Nowhere close to the full one-year from my purchase date.  It still isn't even a year since the printer was manufactured!  (They tell you its 'birthdate'.)  You have to pay to talk to tech support if you are out of warranty, so I then filled out a questionnaire about why I claim that my printer is still under warranty when they say otherwise.  They claim to have a 24-hour response time.  I'm still waiting 10 days later, and there is no response.  Thus the one-star review.  Hopefully this gets HP's attention.",

I have a lot of knowledge of routers and networking but this one hascaused me a lot of hassle. The whole point of wireless printing is lost with this.

It is flaky as can be.  About a third of the time it doesn't work on wifi -- but it is a nice feature thought.  Your level of productivity is probably higher if you went to a shop to scan in your documents.  Perhaps you should have an Epson scanner on the side.  But, then, why buy this?  I suggest you look elsewhere -- seriously.  I've had a lot of HP failures and wish that Apple would get back into printers or I'll move over to another brand.....Added a tad later.  I actually don't know if any manufacturer has a better printer.  They may all be difficult with Apple Macs.",

I performs well--I have used the fax, scan and copy functions.  Faxing seems slow as the pages have to scan in and their are pauses between sheets but it does work well.  However, on the downside it took 10 hours to install this machine.  We could not get the wireless hookup to work.  We called the chat helpdesk--agent in India--after 2 1/2 hours, he had totally wasted my time.  I called and spoke to an agent in the Phillippines--much more knowledgeable who also took 2 1/2 hours and finally  connected the machine via an ethernet cable and it worked.  Why it took 5 hours to get to this & why it could not be connected wireless still remains a mystery.  Now that it is working, we like the machine.  We do suggest not using agents in India.",
404,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,0,0,5-Dec-12,A38B5HTDS05TJ1,Pain to print envelopes,"I've had this printer for about 3 months now in my small business office with daily use, printing maybe 20-50 sheets per day.I am satisfied except for one thing, printing envelopes or any time you need to change paper types.  You have to slide out the paper tray in the front and remove all existing paper, then replace it with whatever you're printing on, then do the reverse to switch back to copy paper.  This may not sound like much but to print one envelope it creates quite the hassle instead of allowing you to place the envelope on top of the stack of copy paper (like the previous HP model I owned), or having a separate slot for envelope feeding.  Like most printers, it gets a little finicky when trying to print on one single sheet in the feeder tray, it takes a few trys to get it to grab the paper/envelope.",
405,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,0,0,4-Dec-12,ARFXSHUN74OY5,Good value,I have had this printer for about a month and I have been pleased thus far. I use the scanning function on a daily basis. It is not as fast as a dedicated scanner but it is still efficient (don't expect it to scan 20 pages in a minute) The auto feed function allows you to do other things while the scanning is taking place. The set up process was user friendly. The main negative is the price of the ink.,
406,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,7,8,3-Dec-12,A3MDIB90DYL9NH,Not happy with this printer!,"I bought this multifunction printer a year ago.  It works fine for printing in black and white and color.  I have only recently begun using it for scanning and trying to print photos.  Before using this printer while I had an older HP multifunction machine, I would typically scan documents in the range of 25-50 pages, save them as PDFs, and email them without a problem.  With this printer, when I scan the documents the PDF files that are created are so huge that they are unable to be emailed due to their size.  I spoke with HP customer service and was given no explanation or help, even when trying to tell them my old HP machines didn't have this problem.  Documents scanned in color, by the way, are a fraction of the size of black and white scans and can be emailed easily.  Scanning with this machine is *extremely* slow.  Also, in regard to trying to print photos on photo paper, forget it.  The paper feed will not pick up photo paper.  I have tried HP photo paper and other brands to no avail.  This will be the last HP machine I ever purchase.",

If you just want to copy and scan thing and dont care about the quality, then no problems. BUT if you are serious about what you scan and want control over the scans, you need a dedicated scanner. I have a canon scanner for serious scanning.  I cannot speak about the fax function since i dont use it. My one irritation is you have to push the paper output tray closed to access the paper tray when empty or want to change paper type. It also doesnt like heavy weight paper.",

Criminal Activity by HP to get you to buy more super expensive cartridges which print 150 pages or less (on default) Default ink settings are NOT on Economy, again to rip you off forcing you to buy more ink, if you change default to economy ink printing it will automatically revert to INK Drink settings Again to force you to buy more ink! So unless you change the settings to economy or draft EACH time you print you will run out of ink in like 150 pages! HP Sends Criminal updates to your Printer tell U Buy Cartridges! Cartridges are very very expensive....These problems were corrected by me when I uninstalled all the bloat ware HP software, BUT only AFTER I uninstalled and used generic drivers instead AND BLOCKED the Printer from Communicating with HP !

410,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,65,69,29-Nov-12,A399KOCFFQQVPY,Useless as a scanner,"I bought the HP Officejet Pro 8600 Premium (the same as the 8600 but with two paper trays)because it had an automated document feeder that could hold 50 pages.  I was using a Fujitsu Scan Snap 1500, which holds less than 20 pages, and was hoping to reduce scanning time. I also thought I could save money buying an all-in-one machine.  Big mistake. This scanner is EXTREMELY slow.  The product specs say it scans at 'up to 11 ppm.'  That is only true if you scan at 75 dpi in black and white, which leaves you with a scan that is barely legible even when scanning simple black and white typed pages.  If you scan at 200 dpi - which is ok quality, but not great - you get 3 pages per minute!  If you want to scan at a higher quality dpi, the document feeder can not be used.  Instead, you have to manually place each page on the glass, go through the cumbersome scan process with every single page.  For comparison, my Fujitsu scans 20 ppm at 600 dpi.  If you are looking for a scanner, just buy the Fujitsu and buy a separate printer!  If you do decide to buy this printer, note the 14 day return policy and test it out the day you get it or you will be stuck with it!",

418,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,3,3,16-Nov-12,A1C7BVGIMX57J2,Outstanding HP product,"PROS:We run a small business and I am also the department head of a government agency.  I handle all the IT for both our business and my government agency.  I tried several printers, and recently read the CNET reviews about the HP OfficeJet Pro 8600.  This model comes in three versions, the 8600, 8600 Plus and 8600 Premium.  I went with the premium as it best fit our needs.  It works great.  It was an cinch to set up.  It took me longer to unwrap the printer from the packaging then to actually set it up on wifi.  The enclosed CD gives you the drivers that I had to install on our Macs OS 10.7 and 10.8 and our Windows 7 Pro computers.  The CD install ran smooth and I completed the first install in about 10 mintues with the remaining installs taking no more than 5 mintues.  You can also obtain the HP 8600 drivers from hp.com/support.I highly recommend this all-in-once device.  It's own web access is especially nice and the applications that HP added to this device is a techy fun, but also great for beginners.The touch screen menu display is vividly clear, easy to understand and easy to read, (even without reading glasses).  I usually read the entire manual on every item I purchase, but I found the 8600 Plus so easy to operate that I didn't read the manual to perform the set up operations.  It also helps that HP programmed into the 8600  complete step-by-step instructional video to help you set up the printer.  As soon as you plug it in and turn it on, you get instant help.If you need a fast printing, high quality device that is easy to set up and operate, this is your device.  This device is superb for personal use, in home office use or small business use.CONS:The only con I have to report is the 8600 takes up a lot of space.  If you are short on space to put your printer, this is not the device you want.  It will take up the entire shelf of most medium to large computer equipment cabinets.  It requires a space at least 18' wide and 12' long.  The 8600 stands a little over 12' high with the extended ADF on top.  That's the only CON I have to report.",

422,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,3,3,10-Nov-12,A10P5LYBOSE58I,Inkjet and good? YES!,"I for one would never have thought it possible that I would write a positive five star review about any inkjet printer. Probably the only two printers I have owned in my lifetime that I could recommend with 5 stars was the Panasonic 1080i dot matrix, which I used with my Commodore 64, and my HP LaserJet P2015dn. What do I like about this printer?Pros:1) Very low ink usage. I am very surprised on how frugal it is with ink. Yes, the cartridges are expensive, but for an inkjet printer, they last far longer than any inkjet I have ever had before. This is without doubt the main attraction of this printer.2) The wireless setup is far easier than anything I have ever experienced before. The printer has a very nice touch pad screen that walks you through the process painlessly. You need absolutely no technical expertise to set it up.3) The software is great. What I need is a good OCR system to scan in pages of books I've read. The included OCR software is very good. I scan to .rtf format, crop to what I need, and paste my completed text into WordPad. I had a problem with Word because sometimes it would create a two column document when I didn't want it to. WordPad didn't allow the formatting for two columns, and so that solved my issue. It is very rarely that I need to correct the spelling due to poor OCR.4) The touch pad on the printer is one of its nicest features. Perform functions like scanning or copying or checking ink levels with ease.5) I do mostly duplex printing of brochures and booklets. Probably I've made 150 sixteen page booklets, and 300 tri-fold brochures. Both have a mix of color pictures and black text. I'm using 28 lb. paper and have never had a jam or problem so far. I'm on my 3rd ream of paper, and have replaced all the cartridges once. This may sound bad, but it's way better than I've experienced in the past. If I need to copy anything, it takes about 30 seconds for the first page.6) Usually this doesn't matter to me, but I like how it looks. (I'm beginning to feel like a HP salesman.)Cons:1) It's large. better check the dimensions of your printer space before getting it. Fairly tall as well.2) No third party cartridges available. Usually I order refilled cartridges. I tried this, and to my disappointment none are available. I'm sure HP is doing all they can to keep the ink purchases for themselves. That's the real problem with companies these days, they're so profit driven that customers are treated like lemmings.3) The printer is always asking me if I want to update the software? I don't, and wish it would quit asking.4) We don't have a landline, so I don't use the fax. Not really a con.All in all, I highly recommend this printer.",
423,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,1,1,6-Nov-12,A5M5AJ0YUSGNK,Great Product...worth every penny!,We love this item.  It's does everything and than some.  My son loves the Disney app and the whole family enjoys the daily crossword puzzle app as well.  I would recommend this product in a hearbeat!,
424,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,2,3,5-Nov-12,A23X0QV7Q3SPCX,No problems and great product,"This is the fourth HP multifunction all-in-one printer I've bought over the past few years, including the 6500A, L7780, and 8500.  All of them are still in service and I have never had a problem with any of them.  I am not disappointed by this latest model.  The printer seems rugged enough and well-designed.  I like the fact that the power cord plugs directly into the printer without a power brick.  The print quality and speed seem great.Set up couldn't be easier.  I connected it to our wired Ethernet network, turned it on, and followed the on-screen instructions that are shown through animation.  I think some people complaining about the printer not functioning the way they want may be taking shortcuts during the setup process.  (I have not tried the Wifi setup, as I don't need it.)I can easily access all the features of this device through other PCs and devices on our local network, and can easily print directly from my iPhone and iPad!  The printer actually automatically shows up as a printer on these devices.  Using the hp e-print feature (where you assign an e-mail address to the printer), you can print anything to the printer by e-mailing it.  You can also control exactly who is allowed to e-mail print jobs to the printer.  I recommend restricting it so you won't have to worry about the printer getting a lot of spam mail that could cost you a lot in ink and paper.If I run into any problems with this device, I'll update my review.

One of the best things about HP is that they were compatible with Windows 8 from day one and even had an app in the Windows store to access the scan feature for both documents and photos.  I absolutely loved the fact that it was not necessary to install separate drivers, which made printing from my wife's Surface tablet equally easy.The print quality is solid and it's extremely fast (as fast as the old Canon 4150 laser printer it replaced.)  The large-capacity print cartridges are a boon and I doubt that I'll need to replace them for literally a year or more due to the moderate use my family gets from the printer.

Print latency is longer than described, not a deal breaker, but annoying when combined with other annoyances.3. Inks run out too quickly and you cannot select a black only print mode.4. Color inks are too expensive.For a company that is supposed to dominate the printer business, this was a huge disappointment, they should be able to do better.At first I thought that I had a lemon, bet then I kept running into more disturbing features.  This is disappointing by design.My advice is to look elsewhere.",

I couldn't be happier with this printer.  It prints extremely fast... faster than my old laser printer!  Also being able to scan directly to a network drive, computer, or send it to e-mail is a great feature to have.  All in all this printer really does it all.  I'm surprised that it is currently only at 3.5 stars because to me this is the best most fully featured printer I've ever owned.  Before buying this I tested out many printers at Best Buy and looked up a lot of reviews on Amazon.  This printer just stood out amongst the rest of them with all the features it has.Pros:- iOS compatibility- Scan to network drive- Scan to e-mail- Fast sheet feeder for scanning- very fast!- small office workhorse- network printing, no fuss software setupCons:- proto printing isn't the best but that's not really what this printer is for...- beware on windows to only enable ink level warnings during print otherwise the software may be a resource hog...Conclusion:This is by far the best printer I've ever owned.  It does everything I need it to do and does it well.  There is no comparison between this printer and the entry level printers on the market.  You could easily spend more on a high end business printer but at the price point, I don't think you can beat this printer.",

I bought this All-in-one because my wife found our existing scanner and fax set up too difficult for her to use. The 8600 Plus is mind-numbingly simple to use. Insert papers in document feeder, follow instructions on screen. As to the set up, I had read the reviews saying that it was difficult. I would say the set up of the product was VERY simple, with one exception. I did not need any wires (other than the plug) to get the printer and scanner working. My wife could have set this up herself with one exception, the scan to network folder. I actually had to used the included software from my desktop to set up the network folder (on a WIFI enabled NAS). Other than that, all setup was done by following the prompts on the all-in-one's front screen. As an aside, although I bought this for my wife, I have literally scanned hundreds of pages already, emptying my file cabinet of old paper records. This thing works very, very well. I was a bit annoyed that my wife wanted me to replace a perfectly good scanner and printer with something 'easier', but I am now sold. It is fast, accurate and simple to use.",

I bought a 6210 back then for me and one for my wife. Hers still works fine after eight years. These things are workhorses. I used a non-HP print cartridge in mine that exploded, causing the paper to stick and the printer to jam. It was a big mess inside and I decided it was time to consider buying a new printer instead of cleaning up the mess.  I felt guilty given what a reliable printer the 6210 had been.Based on Amazon reviews, which I always check and value, I would never have gone with an HP.  However, I asked my computer guru what he would pick and he strongly recommended the 8600. Based on his staunch support and my prior experience with HP printers, I went with the HP.My daughter also has an HP C3100 purchased in 2006, which she has never had trouble with. She told me the other day she lets other students print on her HP when theirs break down.While my prior experience was good in terms of basic printing and reliability, I always felt the HP software was a bit difficult. The scanning process was always a pain, for example.I just finished setting up the 8600. It was a breeze. The way it's packed and the way the instructions are set up it was a pleasure. Within an hour it was all set up and I had sent a fax, scanned a document, copied a document (in color) and printed a document - all via a wireless connection that took two minutes to set up.The print speed, scan speed and fax speed are lightning fast.The old problem of difficult software no longer exists. The software on the PC is easy to use and the new control panel on the printer is like the menu on a smart phone - very easy to navigate and use.The WebPrint feature is also easy to use. Anything you can email to your personal  @hpeprint.com address can print. So devices that don't have easy print solutions - phones, tablets - now do.Time will tell how reliable the printer is, how economical it is and if it will be a reliable workhorse like its predecessors. But the first hour, which I always dread, was a pleasure.",

I experienced 3 significant problems with it:1. The color tone was disappointing. Reds looked brown. Technical assistance advised to install new ink cartridges in place of the set-up cartridges. The new cartridges definitely improved the color, but still not perfect. Can't understand why the ink in the set-up cartridges would be different.2. Whenever I printed a color image, about 3 to 4 one-half inch wide significantly dark bars would appear on across the image horizontally in normal print. In 'best' quality print, the bars would disappear. After spending 3 hours with the technical assistant we gave up. Technical assistant acknowledged a problem.3. I could not get the printer to feed 110 lb. card stock.I returned the above printer, & tried the HP Officejet Pro 8600 plus e-all-in-one N911g. This is essentially the same printer as above only with one tray. This printer printed about 4 to 5 faint black lines horizontally across the image about 3 points thick evenly spaced across the image in normal print. In 'best' quality print, the lines would disappear. I spent about an hour with technical assistant. Technical assistant sent to me a new print head assembly which seemed appropriate. The new print head made absolutely no change. This one too would not feed cardstock. I have returned this one as well.Simple black & white printing was just fine with both printers. All other features seemed to work.I'm using a brand new Dell laptop with Windows 7 Home Premium OS, & loaded HP's drivers from their CD.Based upon this experience I'm purchasing a different brand of printer.Seems like HP's quality has deteriorated dramatically.I have an 8 year old HP G85 all-in-one that still works very well, but it's incompatible with Windows 7 unfortunately, & HP does not have an updated driver for it.",

458,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,2,3,22-Sep-12,A25MWRUUFW9U6R,A few improvements would help this printer,"MEETING EXPECTATIONS:(1) I ordered this printer in December, 2011. It arrived promptly, set up easily, including wireless for PC users.(2) It had good life in the print cartridges printing a few pages/week use for each of four people(9 months). The setup cartridges made it through the summer, just two have needed to be replaced to date.(3) I'm very happy with the fax feature - it works well, can be set up to allow another answering machine to pick up, and will accept manual prompt to receive fax. It has caller ID onscreen, too.(4) Standby feature conserves electric wtihout making printer unavailable.  DISAPPOINTMENTS:(1) This printer cannot handle cardstock. I can understand two-sided printing might be difficult on cardstock, but for one-sided applications, this should be possible.(2) This printer is TOO smart. My old HP printer would crank away with a low or empty cartridge - the finished product would show it. Now, I want to print in black and white, but since my yellow ink cartridge is empty, NOTHING will print. HP, are you desperate to sell more ink?! Let us mess up our printouts if we want to! LOL! There is a black-cartridge only option to select - but it only works when the color cartridges are working.(3) The helpful color touch screen also looks for many ways to encourage you to print apps. It should be possible to preview pages on-screen without ALWAYS needing to print it, sight unseen (wasting both ink & paper).  LEARNING THE HARD WAY:(1) Contacting '24 hour HP support' means a self-guided help menu. DO NOT count on it addressing your particular issue (why does the printer say replace cartridge when it is full), or easily being able to get a question answered except through submitting 'in-warranty' claims.(2) I replaced the Black setup cartridge with the 950XL cartridge. Then the yellow cartridge ran out. Then (I haven't gotten a yellow cartridge yet)the printer told me the black cartridge must be replaced (after one week's use). TURNED THE PRINTER OFF AND THEN BACK ON. NOW it knows the black cartridge is full. (As in 'reboot it!')(3) When it says 'replace a cartridge soon' - as my yellow one - it means you might be able to print only ONE more page before the printer will not print ANYTHING (in any color or even using black cartridge only). I didn't want to stockpile ink and have it become 'old', but do need to have it in advance or live without printing until getting more.  SUMMARY:Over all a decent, capable printer, but HP, why not tweak it into a wonderful printer?!",

So unless you want to feed a pile of documents by hand, stay away from this and buy another brand such as Epson that keeps their word.

There is a 'low ink' warning, about 50 pages before the end, and then, when the end comes, it just stops printing - a very satisfactory solution to this issue, it seems to me.Copying is generally good, with reliable paper handling.Faxing: I have not had any of the difficulties reported by earlier reviewers (but then my use of the fax function is limited to only 2 or 3 times a month).2-sided printing is easy and reliable.Two irritations:It does not handle thicker, heavier (than 20#) paper well, or even at all - heavy weight photo paper from Costco will not work.Most disappointing: the simple task of printing an envelope is freighted with difficulties.  Instead of simply choosing the size of the envelope in Word, you have to go into the 8600 setup and change the size of the paper!  Incredibly stupid. I fail to understand why HP cannot correct this with a software update, but so far it has stubbornly refused to even recognize that this is an issue.All in all, a good, perhaps even very good, multi-function printer, but with a couple of surprising negatives.",

466,XX,B005O55U2Y,3,14,16,1-Sep-12,AACCSNDE8T7ON,"Beware of Wireless""""","I bought this about a year ago, and since then, every two weeks, the printer goes nuts and stops talking to the rest of the network. You go to print or scan, and the device (PC or iPad) tells you it can't find the printer. You check the printer, and it thinks it's online with a valid IP address, but the printer can't be found. So, I call HP for help, and here's what they told me. 'It's your network; reboot your network and all your devices.' Ok, but after the first 5 or 6 times, I finally explain to them that of the dozen or so devices on my network - a couple of desktops, a couple of laptops, some tablets, smartphones, a cell phone microcell, and other devices - the ONLY device that seems to have a problem staying connected to the network is the printer. And to shut down the network and reassign IP addresses to the machines just because the printer can't handle it is stupid.So, I talk to HP Tech Support some more. They tell me to call my ISP, who doesn't work with internal networks. Finally, the guy from HP tells me that the default settings for my router can't just be default, that the HP only works with Channel 6 or some crap like that. He said it was one of those things that is not in the manual, but should have been told to me during my first tech support call.But then, sure enough, two weeks later, the printer goes nuts and goes offline again. It won't connect back up. Finally, at that point, the woman at HP says I should just connect it via USB. She says the wireless card is weak and can't go very far, and she wants to know how far from my router it is. I explain it's about a foot away from the router. She says again I should put in the USB slot, and I ask her what her definition of 'wireless' is.Finally, several weeks ago, I got a guy from HP who told me quite honestly that their wireless cards suck and that they can't stay connected. He said this was a known and common problem and that HP recommends that their printers are connected via a wire. 'If your printer is only a foot away from the router, why don't you connect it up via a wire?' he asked. Because I only have four ports, and they are taken by my devices that ONLY work via a wire. 'Well, I have one and had the same problems you do, so I connected it via a wire. Find a device you don't use, and connect this one in that place, and you can have the printer work ALL THE TIME!' I asked him why they marketed the printer as 'wireless' when they have these wireless issues? He said because HP has the best printers in the world. I threatened to dump this printer and get an alternative made by another company, and he said 'Good luck, HP makes the best. You'll be back to HP.' Kind of a flippant answer, but there you go. Oh, and he made the hard sell on additional coverage of tech support since mine is almost up. I told him before I gave HP another dime, I'd go with a competitor.I've spent about 16 hours total on the phone with tech support trying to make the wireless work, and I've finally given up and just gone wired.Anyway, it's been a couple of weeks now, and the WIRED HP printer is working just fine. Does all it's supposed to do, but I did have to go out and buy an additional 5 port switch, some wire, and plug in one more device into my already overflowing chain of surge protectors. Thanks for the useless 'wireless' feature, HP!By the way, I found that Canon makes a competing product, the PIXMA MX432. If this one goes nuts and decides he doesn't want to play nice with the rest of the network - again - I'm buying that one. Yeah, HP, you heard that - I WON'T be back!",

I'm  not thrilled about getting a refurbished unit as a replacement, but they will still honor the original warranty, so as long as I don't have any additional problems, I'll be happy.I use this printer for my home-based business, which means that my teenage kids also use it for their school projects.  It replaced a trusty Brother MFC 7840w that was an absolute workhorse.  The only reason I replaced my trusty Brother MFC laser printer was because I was getting tired of the 10 pm runs to Kinkos to get color copies made for their school projects.The wife LOVES the Airprint capability - we are a 100% Mac household, with 4 iPhones, 2 iPads, an iMac, and 3 MacBooks, but the wife never uses a 'real' computer anymore now that she can print everything she wants from the iPad or iPhone.There are a TON of features on this printer - some useful, some gimmicky.  One neat feature is the ability to print the Sunday comics automatically (and lots of other things if you want).  You go online and configure the automatic printing apps you want installed on the printer, then schedule them to print the content you want and the time you want it.  You can easily get carried away (which I am sure is what HP wants so they can sell more ink!) but my 12 year old loves waking up every Sunday morning to his favorite comics, all printed in color.I have not had any paper handling issues, but other than printing double-sided, I'm not really stressing this thing much.  The construction is cheap plastic for the most part, but the 'bronze-brown' color is more pleasing to me than the old 'putty' colors that HP used to use on their office machines.As far as connectivity, access from the network, and set of software tools, I have been THRILLED with this unit.  HP really got it right with respect to being easy to setup and use in a Mac environment.  I can scan from any computer on the network, and even scan directly from the unit itself and choose the computer destination for the scanned files, INCLUDING my Synology Diskstation NAS (where I archive all my important documents).Hopefully, I will not be plagued by hardware problems that other reviewers have complained about, but my experience with the HP tech support was very, very good.",

DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER.  The customer service experience was worse than terrible, tech support was incompetent until I got to a supervisor after repeatedly begging for one, and it took me 2 hours and 10 minutes to get to the end of the process.",
472,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,1,1,16-Aug-12,A3T1LX9BZ4MT76,What a printer!,"Thanks HP and thanks Amazon.  Great price...timely shipping...arrived without a scratch.  Hook up took all of about 30 minutes from the time I started unpacking to fully set up.  Chose to go wireless and had zero problems..truly plug and play.  My local network includes both XP and Windows 7 home and windows 7 pro.  I have sense connected the printer to the desk top XP machine to avoid IP conflicts with my windows 7 pro.  Quiet, fast, prints both sides automatically.  Really glad I made the purchase!",
473,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,6,7,12-Aug-12,A22LLMU06SMTGF,Works Nicely,"After doing my due diligence and criss-crossing the web looking for a replacement for my Canon MP500 that up and quit, I finally settled on the Officejet Pro 8600 Plus.  Here is my experience.1. Out of the box - easy to get out and put together.  Either read the papers or carefully go over the device (my preference) and pull off all the tape and remove any cardboard or foam spacers.  Plugged it in and powered it up.2. After hitting the power button (on the front - bonus) and opening the front access panel, waited a minute for it to settle down and leave the print head where I could stick in the ink cartridges.3. Next I went through the configuration on the printer LCD touch screen (I never read any printed documentation, not necessary).  While no iPhone, the touch screen is responsive enough to be quite usable...even while typing the WPA password (wireless set-up was painless) on the QUERTY on-screen keyboard.  I finished the configuration without issue.  It concludes by printing out a page on how to customize ePrint.4. Tried out iPrint/AirPrint from iPhone.  Worked great.  Even duplex!  It does pause briefly between front and back printing to let ink dry.5. Went online and customized ePrint.  Why not have a more friendly email address for my printer?  Sent a test email with a Word attachment.  Came out nicely.6. Installed the full HP print/scan suite on an iMac (did full suite install since this is the machine we will be scanning from..more on that later).  No issues.  Just told it to skip initial printer set-up since I had already completed it using the LCD.  Printed without issue.7. Installed the printer via auto-discovery on a Mac laptop.  Used Apple supplied drivers.  Printed without issue.8. Installed the printer on a Win 7 laptop.  Downloaded the drivers from HP.  Printed without issue.  (Do be careful to uncheck installing all the crapware on Windows. eg. Bing toolbar)9. Time for some Scanning.  Brought up HP Scan on the iMac.  Stuck some pages in the document feeder and told it to go.  Check.10. Copy using document feeder worked as expected too.It is hard to ding a product that does what it should.  Print and scan quality is good.  Things I have yet to try: Initiate scan from printer to computer, Scan from printer to Google, send a fax.My only complaint so far is the HP Scan software is limited.  Seems like there used to be a HP Scan Pro application... will look at 3rd party solutions too.Very pleased thus far.  Will update later.Update 8/30/2012:Still not a fan of the supplied HP Scan software on the Mac; however, am very happy that I was able to use the available Mac Automator Scan action to create a 'Scan to Evernote' button I could put on the dock.  The other good news is that it is well supported by many third party scanning apps for the Mac.  VueScan works well but has quirky interface.  ScanDrop is a new app with promise, still many bugs it seems.Surprised at how much I use the ePrint (send/forward email with attachment to email address HP provides) to print a Word Doc or PDF email attachment.Very pleased with printing and ink use thus far.Update 4/14/2013:Two things to report.  First, after about 2200 pages, the automatic document feeder (ADF) broke.  It jammed, my wife cleared the jam and then it would simply not feed.Good news is that customer service was excellent; picked up the phone almost immediately and after about 45 mins. on the phone (went thru their troubleshooting steps), they declared the ADF unit unusable and sent me a replacement printer via FedEx overnight.  While an inconvenience, I was pleased with how HP handled everything.Second, I finally sent a fax!  While feeling slightly nostalgic, the fax was sent (over a Vonage VoIP phone line) just fine.  I will likely never use it again....but it works!I'm very happy with the print quality and ink use.",
474,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,1,9,12-Aug-12,AGS3TT2IXQ9C7,Save your money!,"AMAZON IS THE BEST BUY!  The store named Best Buy claims to have a 30 return policy. I bought an HP printer from the so-called Best Buy store and I soon ran out of ink.  I also had a terrible time with the HP printer.  The HP printer had very little ink, it took forever too get the printer to start, it made a lot of noise when compared to other Brand named printers, it took a long time to print let alone shut down and it printed a test page that used up a great amount of INK without me directing it to.  The HP printer also has very little INK that comes with the HP printer and when I purchased extra regular INK cartridges I ran out very soon. I found this out with HP printers; very little INK.  If you buy a regular HP ink cartridge you are buying what I call a sample HP INK cartridge since it runs out of ink quickly.  If you think about it the HP cartridges that show 2.5 times more INK are the same size as the regular cartridges.  You then have to ask, 'how much ink do they really put in the regular OVER priced HP INK cartridges'?  I considered myself cheated when I bought the regular sized cartridge.  My personal opinion is that the HP 2.5 times more INK cartridges run out after printing only about 50% more than the regular overpriced HP INK cartridges while you end up paying a lot more.The only good thing about my experience with the Best Buy store is that I was able to try out the HP INK supply and the printers' performance!  I could suggest doing the same but I won't.  I will state that I wasn't shy returning the HP printer to the Best Buy store because I was not afraid of this chain store and I was not satisfied with the performance of the HP Printer.  Best Buy says you have 30 days to return the HP Printer you should have 30 days but this is a misnomer!  I tried the HP printer I bought from the Best Buy store and I didn't like its performance.  The Best Buy store states that you can return it within 30 days for a full refund if you don't like its performance.  I took the Best Buy store for their word and I returned the HP printer to the Best Buy store after 25 days of use.  The Best Buy store would not take the return without me signing a statement stating that I would not return anything I buy until after a 90-day period from the time I returned the HP Printer.  I should have told them to F off and accept my return without signing their statement.  The Best Buy store also wants a photo ID from everyone when they return something.  If the item is being charged back to your credit card then you should not have too give them any ID!  This amounts too invasion of privacy (Big Brother).  AMAZON IS THE BEST BUY!  AMAZON DOES NOT ASK FOR A PHOTO ID!My opinion is that the Best Buy store is not the BEST BUY! I believe Amazon is the BEST BUY!MY OPINION IS THAT Amazon does have the BEST BUY.  Amazon is not like the so-called Best Buy store.  It is my opinion that Amazon ALWAYS gives you the BEST BUY.  I will stay committed to Amazon and quit buying from the so-called Best Buy store.  Amazon has fantastic delivery, great service, in most states no tax, in most cases free shipping, extended warranties are available and Amazon will take care of any problems immediately, unlike the so-called Best Buy store!",
475,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,0,0,11-Aug-12,A2W2YJ4LV9CVPC,Consistently the Best Electronic Product I've Owned,"I'm a tech person (software engineer). I also care deeply about usability, simplicity, stability. I have owned many printer/scanner thinggies over the years. But nobody has come close to HP's OfficeJet line. I owned a 7300 for 8 years. Fantastic workhorse. Did it all. Now I just bought the new 8600 - not so much because I really needed it (the 7300 was still kicking butt).This one goes a step further in putting all other multi-purpose printer things to shame. Excellent quality. Amazing speed. The cleanest, most brain-dead simple installation and setup across Windows, Mac OS, and iPhone/iPad. I can't find anything this machine doesn't do (except, maybe, that the envelop feeding is a little clumsier than it used to be - yet still perfectly usable).Oh - and did I mention that it's $207 on Amazon?! Everyone knows that HP gets you with the ink-jet cartridges. That's true and nothing that they tell you changes that. Cartridges are obscenely expensive. But taken all together, it's still an impossibly amazing device for the price.Alex",
476,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,0,0,8-Aug-12,A1Q4JQZHICXCDU,Easy Wireless Set up,"I just bought my HP 8600 Plus all in one yesterday and set it up today for the first time.  I will likely update this review later, but given some reviews that talk about it being difficult to set up, I wanted to say how easy it was to set up wirelessly on my home network, which is DSL.  The printer set up on a home network is done directly from the printer display and all I had to do was follow the prompts.  I then set it up as instructed on our computers, with the CD provided. I was able to set up a work laptop with Windows XP, my personal laptop with Windows 7, and my son set up his desktop pc which I believe is also Windows XP.  The pc side set up was done easily and fairly quickly on all 3. I answered all questions when prompted and sailed right thru the set up.So far I have not got around to faxing.  The fax feature is something we will only use once in a while if needed, but it put an HP 8600 fax queue right on my work laptop (which I accidentally tried to use to print, and could not figure out why it was asking me for a fax number at first, lol.  You have to use the 8600 Network queue, duh).I bought mine at Staples on sale because I just didn't want to buy something so big off Amazon.  But don't buy the Staples protection plan if you purchase it there.  I did but will be going in to cancel that and get my money back because they actually described a different plan than the one they sold me.  I did buy my ink on Amazon today, much cheaper than Staples had, and a 4 pack of the XL cartridges also.____________________It has now been over 3 months, and I still love my printer.  Scanning is a breeze and so is copying.  I still have not got around to checking out all the other features available.  I don't print a lot of things, maybe not every day, but I print and copy whatever I want; sometimes for work at home days also.  I have almost gone thru 1 ream of paper at this point.  I've never had an issue with it at all, and I am still using the 'sample' ink cartridges that came with it, which Staples told me would only print 20 or so pages.  At this rate, the new set of ink I bought will be outdated before I get to use it!  I do like the copy feature choice of using black or color ink also._____________________1-1/2 years now and still no issues with this printer.  Faxing is a breeze with it also. just make sure you use a 2 line telephone cord.",
477,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,0,0,8-Aug-12,A2HFVRV50E0KC8,So far awesome printer,"configuring this printer on my windows 7 platform was beyond easy...HP really made things simple; HP has animations to setup the printer, trays and paper feed, all covered in the animations. Wireless setup from the dvd (printer driver install) was done with one click. I was surprise that HP acquire my network settings without asking me for my 128 character password. I printed a few pages, even created an email account with my printer to receive documents via email, awesome feature.  So far so good.",
478,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,0,0,6-Aug-12,A1TH3U6GV2SK2H,Hp stands behind there product,The wireless is nothing but problems for me but that may just be my network. The fax stopped working and HP sent out a replacement right away. Overall Im happy with it.,
479,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,1,1,6-Aug-12,A39Q5DD51FS11J,"A+ Printer, A+ Software","There aren't many products I buy that I can truly say after several months of ownership that I'm ecstatic about but this is one.  I started looking at printers while walking through Walmart and noticed that you can get a printer for about the cost of replacement ink cartridges these days so I dove into printer reviews and settled on this one in spite of the much higher price.This printer delivers like a workhorse.  It is solidly built, the touch screen is awesome, the wireless capabilities are priceless, the separate ink cartridges are a great advantage, the paper tray holds much more paper than my last one did (250 sheets), it is FAST and crisp, and ALL controls are easy to understand.I have learned though that you can have a great printer and still want to throw it against the wall if the software isn't robust and easy to use.  The software shines in little ways that I never would have considered possible.  For instance there is a particular document that I make copies of fairly regularly.  I have set up a 'profile' for this document so that just by selecting this profile the printer remembers that it's a duplex project (and all the other settings) AND the directory to store it in!  I've never seen anything like it.  It makes electronic filing SOOOOOO easy!  I can scan directly into a multi-page PDF - I never could do that before.I have connected XP, Vista, and Win 7 machines to it wirelessly without any problems.  I have never used the ePrint features (can't imagine why I would ever want to) so I can't comment on it.  I've seen reviews of people complaining about the fax options but I've had no problems.  I've faxed long documents flawlessly and received faxes that are clear.  It took me a while to find it but I was able to turn off the fax speaker through the settings (and I really appreciate this feature).One minor issue and one wish - the issue is that on one occasion I had a paper jamb and had absolutely no way to salvage the jammed paper that was coiled onto the roller except to cut it out with a razor.  A little more help with stuck paper would be helpful.  The wish is that there could be a paper level monitor similar to the ink level monitor, but I get that you have to draw the line somewhere!If you are like me and you consider it worth it to spend a little extra for features and functionality that make a HUGE difference in the user experience then I can't recommend this printer any higher.  The only thing that could make me happier would be to add to this review that it is still performing like this after ten years!============================================================2013-Jan .....  Fatal Printer Error after 9 months of use============================================================The printer stopped working.  Was getting paper jamb errors when there was no paper to be found, followed up by 'printer failure' message related to the ink system ( I had just replaced the first print cartridge since I've owned the printer).  To HP's credit their customer service dept was available very late night and walked me through several tests, then when they determined that the printer was no longer salvageable they told me they would send me a new one (although it's going to be a refurbished one; not sure how much I like that but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for now).  Incidentally it was virtually impossible to find a phone number on their site for customer support.  Like all companies now days they try every way they possibly can to make you resolve your issue without an actual conversation with a person, but I called their sales number and they patched me over to customer support ;)I plan to write an update after this gets resolved but I'm giving them credit for sending a replacement and an easy way for me to return the existing printer.  Oh, and they are also sending new ink cartridges - nice touch!  For now I'll leave this as a 5-Star review because other than this I really like this printer.  Subject to revision of course...",
480,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,71,77,4-Aug-12,A3EUW1XPPHWQRF,May or May NOT be Wireless,"I have used this printer for 3 months and all of a sudden the wireless capability stopped working.  The printer shows all the correct settings and says it is connected but shows up offline on the computer.  Have reset everything possible multiple times and printer will not connect wirelessly.  Have uninstalled HP software and re-installed.  Even reset the whole home network.  Other wireless notebooks and other wireless printer all work fine - only this printer will not work.  In searching for solutions on internet I have found numerous complaints about this same issue since December 2011 - at least 8 months now and still no fix from HP for this issue.  When the printer works, the color docs are beautiful but I have had more problems with this printer in just 3 months than all the other printers I've owned for about 20 years put together.The other issue I had with this printer is that 1/2' to 3/4' space is added to all my document margins on the left side of every page and doc is cut off on right side of page.  There is no fix for this problem either - seems to be a printer diver issue.HP Support has no fix for either of these issues and does not seem to be in any hurry to find a solution.  Avoid purchasing this printer until there is a new driver.  Otherwise the wireless feature may fail at any time and document margins change on their own without regard to your software program settings.  If HP could correct those issues, this would be an excellent printer.  Without a driver update, this printer is totally worthless.",
481,XX,B005O55U2Y,2,3,3,2-Aug-12,A1SYMH8YEJ8JLH,Far from reaching expectations!,"I purchased this all-in-one printer to replace my 6-year old Canon printer when the print head went bad.  I had owned an HP printer prior to the Canon, and at the time swore that I would never purchase one again, but I didn't follow my instincts and chose this printer for its wireless capabilities, fast printing, high dpi scanning, memory stick ports and positive user reviews.  4 months in, I'm ready to dump it!Pros:  Wireless was really easy to setup, along with mobile printing.  Works great.  I love the ability to scan directly to any pc connected to the printer. Printing is fast once it starts, but it can sometimes take up to 90 seconds to receive the print signal.  Adjustable scan quality gives greater control when scanning photos.Now the cons:Scanning photos is a pain!  I used to be able to lay 4 to 6 photos out on the scan bed of my Canon (and my old HP for that matter!) and it would scan, separate and crop them automatically.  This one does not.  It will only give you the full scan and leave all the time-consuming editing to you.  I tried feeding the pictures through the ADF, but it only cut off part of the picture and left a permanent line down the face of the photo from the feeder.  Plus, the scan interface (pc) is not very user friendly and does not make it easy to scan several pictures in a row.  It's easier to do that from the scanner control pad, but you cannot access the dpi settings from there.  VERY frustrating!The ADF doesn't work very well.  If you need to feed more than a few pages at a time, plan on doing it in small batches.  It does not 'catch' the papers well and requires force-feeding to start.  More than a few pages and it will grab 2-3 at a time and jam up.  I've tried cleaning the roller but that didn't help.Another issue I have had is that I use Remote Desktop Connection for work, and I cannot print to this printer unless it is connected directly to my pc by usb.  Customer support is minimal.  From what I could see on the support forums, there are many others who experience this issue with no way to resolve it.  When I contacted them by phone, I was told that there was no solution due to the lack of driver support.  I had to purchase a separate cheap printer just for work, making this printer even more expensive!The memory card slots are basically useless.  They are designed only to print from, but I cannot transfer the files on the card to my pc.Although it does have duplex printing, it only has one paper tray to feed from.  This makes it difficult for specialty paper like checks and forms and re-using paper.I often experience lock-ups with this printer, where I have to unplug it for a few minutes to get it back up.My issues may not be important to most users of this printer - if you want something that will just print wirelessly, this is a great printer for that, but priced much higher than most average printers that will do that job well.  I paid the extra for this printer because of its special features and was very disappointed.",

If you are smarter than I and you are already reading this: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRINTER.The printer does not feed photo paper.  I am using the expensive, 5 of 5 star HP Premium Plus paper.  Does not work.  I will not be bothering with little tweaks like rubbing my shirt on the roller wheels to make them less slick or taping paper to get it to print, rather: I will simply be returning it.  The printer fails to perform one of it's primary functions of printing photos.If you don't care about printing photos at all (in which case why did you buy an inkjet printer?) the printer works great.  Wireless setup was very easy.  Prints from iPad using the HP ePrint app.  I have always liked HP products and never considered buying anything else.  I had always used them myself and recommended them to customers when I worked at Staples and Best Buy.  That just changed.

485,XX,B005O55U2Y,2,0,3,28-Jul-12,A2SAJ7X5CGBR3V,Disappointed,"I got this all-in-one for my home office to replace an old HP inkjet. From the second I started unpacking it, I was frustrated. It was very heavy. There were so many pieces of tape hidden throughout the device. The trays felt light cheap plastic. You have to attach the duplex printer cartridge, which sticks out quite far in the back of the machine. You also have to make room for the output tray, which also takes a lot of room. The large size dwarfed my office and felt like a large black box was crowding the room. Wireless setup was difficult and it should have been a snap. I ended up needing a USB cable to set up my 'wireless' service. How dumb. Of course, it didn't come with the USB cable, so I had to go and spend more money. The interface was lovely, but seemed to take awhile to boot up each time. It also took too many keystrokes to perform some basic tasks. Once it was up and running, I expected to be home free... Immediately the printer hung and I had to reboot. Then paper jam errors appeared when there was no jam. Then the duplex printing didn't work. Troubleshooting software was no help. The ability to print via email was cool, though. As was the fact that all 4 print cartridges were not 'starter' versions. I didn't need or want to pay for the fax feature. So, I returned it for a much smaller Epson printer for half the price.",

487,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,2,3,26-Jul-12,A2I3S3GZHL99UG,Works fine now that I figured out the install,Great printer. Works great with XP. The software is a little clunky compared to the HP 1536dnf I recently used. Which is a shame because the 8600 is a much better piece of hardware. There is no seperate icon for scanning or faxing with the 8600 as there is in the 1536. You have to load the 'main' menu which seems to recompile itself everytime you use it. I found the scan icon in the program files and copied it to the desktop so that I don't have to go through so many steps to scan. I have not been able to fax using the print function (I tried it out) and have not bothered yet because I have a fax modem in the computer with seperate software for faxing. Faxes fine when faxing directly from the 8600.The printer was very sensitive to the power strip. I had to adjust the prongs to make it work. An HP laser printer at work burned out because it does not like a power strip and wants to be plugged into the wall. My usage is much less so for me I doubt the power stip will be an issue.Don't bother to install the software using the disk from HP on windows 7 or 8. Download the software from the internet and you will be fine.,

491,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,1,1,25-Jul-12,A3NTUO8EA80TCJ,Best All-In-One Printer I've Found,"I have had the previous model (8500 Pro) and the the Epson 837 all-in-one. This review will be in comparison to those models. Despite the Epson receiving great reviews, I find that the HP's are consistently better. Both HP's have been really solid overall, and particularly when it comes to the functions that really matter in an all-in-one. That is, scanning, copying (flatbed or feed-style, and dual sided), network reliability and ease-of-use, and of course printing quality and speed. The HP is excellent in each of these categories, and also has a much more intuitive interface than the Epson. Conversely, the Epson has been very annoying to use. Trying to setup any network features beyond the most basic has been a real pain. Additionally, it prints too slowly and the feed-mechanism just plain sucks. They decided to go with form over function. You really need a printer that is a little larger in order to gain some necessary functionality. The HP 8600 is the perfect blend of form and function in my opinion.Now, I got the new 8600 model only because I wanted to be able to print from my iPad. To my surprise, this printer also provided a significant improvement above my already-great 8500 in almost every way. The printer works so well, and all of the network functions have been so easy to set up, that I am almost in disbelief. Every aspect of my previous printer that I thought was great before, has been improved in this model. The double-sided copying and printing is a lot better and faster than it was before. On top of each of the categories I mentioned in the paragraph above, this printer also has a better screen, more network functionality, and the printer is a bit sleeker as well.One last thing I'd like to mention is that this printer has a great feature that I have been hard pressed to find in any other printer on the market--the ability to forward incoming faxes to your email or computer. I haven't started using this feature yet, but I've always been annoyed that I couldn't do this in the past. I think the benefits of having all your incoming faxes automatically converted to a digital format and sent to your inbox are pretty clear. Good job HP.",

The quality of the printer when printing documents is great.  The issue is that it will not print envelopes in MS Word 2007.

Amazon should list all of the 'known problem' so that you can make an educated decision about if you want to buy this product.  We are very dissatisfied with this purchase!,

I did a ton of research on Amazon comparing it to many other all-in-ones before buying this one. I'm a pretty tech savvy person and generally able to handle all my home IT needs. However, this printer has never worked well since I purchased it just over 30 days ago. My computer often cannot find either the printer or scanner on the network whether I am connected by wire or wireless. It has been overall an extremely frustrating experience that has wasted so much of my time. I'm so frustrated that I just logged on to Amazon to figure out how to return this thing, but unfortunately it doesn't look returnable. So I am resorting to writing a rare review (for me) on Amazon.I advise anyone not to buy this printer. I can't imagine other printers would be harder to configure. I have actually installed and re-installed the printer drivers / setup / configuration multiple times. I should give it one star instead of two, but as I said I really want to like this printer.",

Setting it up on a wireless system was another matter with the D-Link wireless router.  It took a technical rep using a special program to allow him to operate my computer and lap top over a two day period to get the thing to function properly.  Fortunately for me the tech support person hung in there until we got almost everything working.  He had to use our lap top which was set up wireless in order to get my computer and new HP unit to function wirelessly.  The computer had not been hooked up wireless before I got this new printer as the old HP All-in-One was not capable of wireless operation.  I later found out that the new unit would not fax wirelessly and I had to hook up a phone line to the unit to get it to fax.  It all works now.  It is nice to be able to print from my wife's lap top using the wireless capability of this unit.Phil,

It's makes a lot of noise, even when it hasn't started printing.2. It's constantly doing some sort of system check, or maintenance--so if  you want to print something tomorrow, you better start the print today!3. It's constantly reporting incorrect ink levels--I can't even remember how many new ink cartridges I threw away because the machine said they were empty--I've put brand new ones in there and they report them as 'ink getting low'4. It wastes lots of ink.5. It will quit printing in the middle of a job, and is very spotty on printing the jobs it has. It takes so long to start printing that you think the job didn't go through, so you print again--then its not unusual to get multiple copies the following day.6. The sheet feeder is already broken. I actually have to buy another printer now--FYI...I have almost $200 worth of ink for this printer, and it's unlikely I can return it--I ordered it online a few months ago.7. The printer is bulky, and heavy--yet has surprisingly cheap plastic parts--like the paper tray cover that falls off all the time.I actually started disliking this printer almost immediately. I would have returned it, but I bought it online, and it would have cost a fortune to return it. There's more complaints, but I'm tired of wasting anymore time on it.BE WARNED!HP, if you're reading this, you can replace my printer, and a little goodwill can go a long way with me.",
501,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,8,9,13-Jun-12,A1Q0NL2TYGFOTG,Excellent Printer,"The printer arrived earlier than promised by Amazon.  I have used this printer in my home for a month, linked to a PC running Windows 7, and am completely satisfied.  I mostly print short documents, but also copy and scan.  I no longer fax, so I cannot comment about that.  Wireless set up is straight forward, easy and went smoothly, using their wizard.  Quality of printing is excellent, and colors appear true.  I bought this printer to replace a broken HP Office Jet 6500.  It is much faster, quieter, and prints higher quality documents.  Printing on two sides of the paper is fun, works well, and saves money.  So far ink usage appears to be reasonable.  I like the touch screen for inputing instructions, and prompts seem easy to understand.  Of all the printers that I have owned over the years, this one (so far) seems to be the best.  I hope that it is reliable.",
502,XX,B005O55U2Y,2,6,7,13-Jun-12,AN2SD00NH6SN,Not as good as I hoped,"Purchased this printer in December 2011 for my office (I'm a solo attorney). I wanted one that could scan, copy, and print and fit into my budget. Generally, the printer has been working fine, but there are two main problems that still annoy me.1. The built-in HP scanning software results in very large pdf files. I often need to scan documents that are 25+ pages, and when I do that just by pushing the buttons on the front of the printer or by using the scan utility that comes with the printer, the scans are often way too big to email or upload. After much searching on the web, the only solution I've found is a workaround--I downloaded a free pdf utility (PDFill is the one I use) and use that program's 'scan to pdf' functionality. This results in manageable pdf file sizes. This may not be a big deal if you're only going to scan one or two pages. I have read that this is a common problem with HP scanning software, so I will not be buying HP for my next multi-function printer.2. About 30% of the time when I try to print regular #10 envelopes from Word, the printer says 'paper mismatch' and won't print. Other times the envelopes print fine. I can't see that I'm doing anything different between the times it works and the times it doesn't. Shutting the printer off and on again doesn't fix it when it decides there is a paper mismatch, nor does taking the envelopes out of the tray and replacing them a thousand times. This is really annoying when it happens, but it doesn't happen all the time. Fortunately, most of what I do is by email, so I don't often have to print envelopes.Otherwise, the printer is fine. I've printed or copied about 2500 pages since I bought it and the quality and speed are both acceptable. I've printed color photos on regular paper and they look very good. I've scanned color photos and they turn out fine for my purposes (attaching them to a report or something). The price was certainly better than other options. But I can't recommend it due to the two issues mentioned above.",

507,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,12,12,2-Jun-12,A1HQLIRG22R5KY,"Fantastic printer, love it!","First I want to write a little comparison review. I recently purchased an Epson 845 WorkForce, based on price and many glowing reviews. What a mistake! The Epson Touchpanel was HORRIBLE! On the Epson, the touchpanel was like looking at a blur, which is totally useless if you want to print pictures, not to mention, Epson's touchpanel looks like an embarrassingly amateurish design, as if it was designed with 1990's technology, UGLY and unintuitive, you literally had to look at a key to find other settings, also the Epson was slow to copy and print. I sent that crappy printer back to Staples. It always amazes me that people will give excellent reviews to a horrendous product just because they saved a few dollars, which is the case for the Epson 845.I now purchased the HP OfficeJet Pro 8600 Plus, and I'm in awe of it's touchpanel. So incredibly intuitive, easily navigated, offers a whole host of features that are intuitively presented. Plus, HP's touch panel is crystal clear, so when you need to print one picture from many of the same shot, you can easily distinguish which one of the pictures is the better of the group.The HP 8600 print speed is blazing fast, also incredibly fast copy speeds via the automatic document feeder. Print quality is absolutely gorgeous! Software setup was simple and fast. I did download the software from their web site rather than install from the CD.Oh, and this printer is unbelievably QUIET. Seriously, the quietest inkjet I've ever experienced. I've owned a few inkjets in my time, and some of them sound like Geppetto's workshop on a busy day. I was stunned when I printed my first page, and the noise was so low, especially compared to other inkjets I've owned.The HP OfficeJet Pro 8600 Plus, also offers an incredible amount of features via wired and wireless networking. I have my printer connected via ethernet, and I can access its settings page via IP address, and it's astonishing the amount of information and settings offered.One problem I've experienced so far, though it may have been improper settings on my part. The 8600 was having problems grabbing heavy stock paper. I had HP's Advanced Photo paper in the printer, and it wouldn't grab the paper to feed it through. I searched around for a solution, and others have complained about this as well. Some say it's a hardware issue, others claim software, others say to ensure you choose a tray output upon submitting a print job. For me, the fix for the problem seemed to be choosing a paper tray. I noticed a second paper tray was listed in my print settings, so before I sent the print job, I ensured Paper Tray 1 was selected. After that, it grabbed the HP Paper with no problems.One other complaint, though this seems to be the trend amongst all inkjet manufactures. NO MANUAL FEED! Why remove one of the best, time saving, and most convenient feature? Why?! I've always used a manual feed for when I just need to print one job on photo paper, or just print a couple of labels, or print one envelope. PLEASE! BRING BACK A MANUAL FEED!!!!!Overall, compared to its competitors, the HP is a little more expensive, but the quality of engineering and design is leaps and bounds ahead of the rest.",

520,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,10,11,9-May-12,A24A3L26U3U378,I'm Happily Surprised,"I bought an 8600 Plus about a month ago after a lot of research, to replace an office Canon MP830 that had given great service as a printer/copier/scanner/fax. I'm very pleased with the 8600 Plus so far. I'll mention just a few things:I've been impressed by the usefulness of the touch-screen. It's definitely a new-generation user interface, compared with the Canon. The HP also uses sound tones to indicate certain events/functions; the Canon had nothing comparable.The WiFi capability made it easy to connect the 8600 with office computers via my wireless router, with setup through the touch screen. (I've had to re-set IP addresses a couple of times, but that hasn't been a major difficulty.)This HP is FAST, and does a great job printing quality text and graphics - no drop in quality from the Canon. I've also printed one photo (on photo paper); it printed quickly and looks great - no bands or unevenness, and excellent color.My biggest surprise is discovering this printer is an ink miser. I'd been wary of HP printers, due to their ink-hog reputation a few years back. The 8600 is using much LESS ink than the Canon it replaced. My ink costs will drop considerably if this continues - I'm still on the first set of tanks, after a lot of printing.I've scanned several documents to PDF, and have found the process easier than with the Canon MP830.My one disappointment is that, as purchased, the 8600 Plus loads paper only through a cassette. The Canon MP830 offered both open-feed (from the back) and cassette options, allowing me to choose two paper types from the software interface. That's a minor irritant, but I mention it because I assumed the 8600 would have an open-feed capability.SIX-MONTH UPDATE: The printer is still running well. I finally replaced the first set of ink tanks over the past month or so, and installed double-quantity tanks ('XL' in product numbers) to last even longer. Print quality is excellent - no banding or running at all. No jamming. I've done a lot of double-sided printing with no errors. The IP-address update issue I noted above is still with me - every couple of weeks I need to update the printer's IP address in order for it to print. I think that's an issue with my wireless router, however. In all, I'm very pleased.",
521,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,2,3,8-May-12,A39JPS9DAMAPY9,All-in-one that does it all.,"UPDATE: the USB port on the front of the printer is powered even when the printer is in standby/sleep mode; nice for charging charging other devices.This printer really does it all.  One of the best features that I didn't realize the scanner had was the ability to scan directly to a network share so you don't even need to have your computer on if you have a NAS.The scanner supports FULL duplex scanning, it automatically flips the pages to scan both sides as well as flipping it back so that the pages don't end up upside down after being scanned.Nice touchscreen display to setup the printer and change settings etc.  The touchscreen could be more accurate but it gets the job done.The printer is a bit on the slow side but considering the price it does well, just don't expect it to be fast.As long as it holds up over time I think that it's a great printer with a big plus on the scanning side doing automatic double sided scanning to a network share, great feature!",
522,XX,B005O55U2Y,3,2,6,6-May-12,AGB7UQZMVHNUJ,Neither the best nor the worst,"This arrived with a huge book, but that was deceptive - only 20 pages were in English, the rest were recaps in other languages. Although it claimed to be a Getting Started Guide, it left out information I would have found useful, like how to set the clock on the screen. Also, although this printer can be used with a USB cable or wireless, it doesn't include a USB cable. Luckily, I had an extra one around. For the price, you'd think they could spare a cable which the box itself calls 'essential'! Set-up was relatively easy, with a few quirks. For example, the identification of outlets on the back of the printer are simply bas-relief black on black. Anyone who doesn't have excellent lighting and even better eyesight might be confused - as I was, since this printer is for home use and I didn't have a spotlight to aim at it. I'm a little dismayed at how large it is, but more important, I think the feeder tray on the top should have been detachable. Anyone (even a curious cat) can break it - it bent alarmingly when I just touched it. I haven't owned this long enough to see whether other problems arise such as were described in other reviews, but I'm worried about the possibility that it won't print only black if any color cartridge is out of ink, as several people have mentioned. Even on sale, this ink is incredibly expensive. This printer was very well regarded on the Consumer Reports website, which is why I purchased it for home use. My sister also purchased it, for business use, and I'm interested in seeing how it holds up for both purposes.",
523,XX,B005O55U2Y,3,8,9,5-May-12,AFV5EGSYRKH1R,Not bad...not great,"On the plus side, it's fairly fast and for an inkjet reasonably quiet.  The setup was fair - be careful when you first insert the ink cartridges. If you put the cartridges in wrong they'll jam and they'll jam in a part of the printer where you can't readily reach them to fix it.My biggest gripe is that envelope printing - which I do a fair bit of - is a major pain in the butt. Unlike my last OfficeJet where you just put the envelope in on top of the paper at the right place and alignment, here you have to REMOVE all of the paper, put the envelope in and adjust the guides. Then it feeds the envelope through BLANK on the first pass...so I guess I need to stick a second envelope or a sheet of paper on top.All in all, my OfficeJet 6500 seemed better for paper handling, but I do like the speed and features of the 8600Plus.",

When that HP 4 finally died on us a few years back, the officejet 7410xi became the all purpose workhorse printer for us.  We loved it because of all the features and that it was a wireless printer.  Starting about 3 or 4 months ago, that printer started acting up where it would not print or the computer cannot find it on the network or it would stop printing in the middle of a print.  If these problems occur on only one computer then I might incline to believe that there was an issue with that one machine.  The similar problem cropped up on several machines.  I went so far as to connect it via USB to my gaming rig and the problem persisted.  Often, the only way to remedy it was to uninstall the printer driver and reinstall it again.  My wife finally got so fed up of having me resolve the printer issue for her that she insisted I looked into buying a replacement.Not sure how other people shops for electronic, I normally take several weeks of researching and reading up on people comments and publications review on several similar items, weighed the pros and cons, narrow down the list of possible choices, go back and read some more before I finally make a purchase.  That brings me to the HP Officejet Pro 8600 Plus.  I picked it over the Officejet Pro 8600 e because it's faster and holds more paper.  I didn't go with the Premium model because I did not need the second tray.  I can always buy a second tray later down the road if I really need it.  Another thing was that Amazon had the Pro model cheaper than Costco with free shipping and no sales tax.  For the money, it costs a bit more than the e model but less than the Premium.  Comparing the 8600 to other all in one such as the Epson lines, I ultimately decided that the 8600 Plus was a better buy in term of quality and cheaper per page printing cost.  I'm sure Epson fans out there will no doubt scream bloody murder over my personal assessment, but hey, when it comes to opinion, to each his own.The printer arrived yesterday via UPS and the packaging was in excellent condition.  Kudos to UPS for improving their delivery service and ensuring that the package arrived in one piece.  The content was neatly packaged and organized.  Several people commented that the 8600 was a fairly hefty printer.  I was a bit worried as to where I would put it due to its size.  When I unpacked it, I found that the length of the 8600 was about the same as the 7410xi while the width was smaller and the height was shorter than the 7410xi.  I have a small book case next to my desk, and the printer sits on top of it.  After I plugged in the printer and powered it up, the touch screen LCD display walked me through on setting it up.  If people took their time and not rush through the on-screen setup, the fat finger problem of selecting something other than what you wanted would not be an issue.  Connecting the ink cartridge to the printer was very easy.  As soon as I opened the front panel, the ink tray slide over and I just had to push in the corresponding color cartridge to the corresponding ink tray.  As soon as I closed the front panel, the printer took a few seconds to recalibrate the ink cartrige and print out a calibration page.Setting up the printer wireless was not so smooth.  Before I go on, the 8600 allows you to connect to the printer via wireless, ethernet (CAT 5 cable) or USB.  I opted for the wireless.  Once I assigned the printer to my home network, and obtained the IP address; by all indications, it is part of my home network and therefore my gaming computer running on Windows 7 64 bit should be able to recognize it on the network.  To my surprise, it didn't.  After a few futile attempts of trying to figure out why it was still not showing up, I opened up the Getting Started Guide.  It looked like HP knew of this and put the instruction to resolve it at the beginning of the Setup Wireless section.  Following the simple instruction, I powered off the wireless router, powered off the printer and even my gaming machine.  Then I powered up the router, printer and gaming computer.  Reinstalled the printer driver and it went through smoothly this time.  Guys, it's a good idea to crack open the guide every now and then even if you're a techie.  If I had done that first, I would not have run into snafu like I did and wasted about 20 minutes of my time.Next,having my ipad with me, I decided to test out the airprint feature.  WOW!  It works!  I then tested the airprint on my wife iPhone 4s, it too works.  My wife loves it, no longer does she have to open up email on her laptop in order for her to print it out.  I set up the eprint feature and enabled it so that my wife can print her google documents directly from the Chrome browser.  No longer does she have to either email the google doc to her home email address then print it, or having to save the google doc on her local computer directory, open it, then print.The printer is extremely quiet.  My wife could always tell when the 7410xi was printing even when she was up on the second floor.  The 8600 noise level is more like a whisper.Printing quality, excellent.  My wife bought 'HP Everyday Copy and Print' paper because it was on sale and like I said, the quality was excellent.  We also have high quality paper, but there was not a need for us to print on it.  I haven't print photos yet so I can't say for certain how photos look.  I can say that color printing using the HP paper that I mentioned produced a good color document result.  Ability to print 2 sided, awesome!  The same goes when making copies.I scanned photos and documents with great results.  You could either use the scan tool from the computer or from the printer touch screen.  The printer touch screen allows you to scan with the output going to the computer of your choice in your home network, memory device, network folder or email.I have not set up the fax feature so I cannot comment on it.Overall, I am extremely please with the HP Pro 8600 Plus.  I love the features, the beautiful, wide and brightly lit LCD touchscreen, and the results it produced.  It is definitely a worthy replacement to our old Officejet 7410xi.  If you're in a market for an all in one color inkjet printer, you can't go wrong with this one.  The Officejet Pro 8600 Plus deserves a 5 star rating from me.",
528,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,2,3,16-Apr-12,A2QT6HCE3LXFD6,Truly Great Printer,"I've owned HP Printers for years.  The last two have not been good.  Horrible software, complex setup, long delays waiting to print and noisy.  I finally decided I had had enough of HP.  I researched for three weeks and ultimately tested my finalists in the store for speed, print quality and set up.  Despite my original intention .... I chose the HP Officejet Pro 8600.  It is AWESOME. Finally, HP got it right.  Brain dead simple set up that works time and again.  Lightweight software.  Fast quiet printing.  And the scanner is so simple to use - drops the scans right onto my computer.  Well done HP.  I liked it so much I bought a second for my office at work.  I highly recommend this product.  HP really got it right.",

I needed a fax machine occasionally and got tired of going to the Post Office or Library to fax something . Copy and Scans great from any room in the house.

530,XX,B005O55U2Y,3,2,5,11-Apr-12,A2BD05F1J198AF,Printer problems,"I got the HP office jet Pro 8600 Plus e-all-in-on Wireless. I got it in last night and was excited to finally get a good printer. Well unpacking and installing everything was easy. The problem I ran into was when you first turn it on and the printer starts the alignment it would start to eat paper. I turned it off and check to make sure that I got all the packing tape or anything that might be blocking the paper. I did not see anything so I thought I might have put in to much paper, so I took out the paper to where only half was in the tray slot. I tried it again and still eat paper. I then called up HP support to see if they can help. HP was sort of helpful, the tech had me take off the back part that allows 2 side print and I was watching how the paper was coming through. I spotted right off why the paper was getting eaten. Seems a small white plastic paper guide was pushed in where all the others where not pushed in. So I pulled the guide out and tried the test print again. It worked after that. But it does make a noise that I am not used to and worry that there might be other problems right now it is working fine just makes a noise that I dont like. I will give it a week and see if anything else goes wrong.",

532,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,2,3,9-Apr-12,A2COIE8HG0K75Y,All-in-one for the e-world,"I purchased the Officejet 8600 Pro Plus about two weeks ago with amazing results.  I installed it in a closet downstairs and is only connected through my wi-fi network.  I have 4 computers that it serves and 3 mobile devices (2 smartphones and an iPad).  Setup was a breeze.....I love that touchpad!It prints fast and great but my primary use for this device was for the scanning.  The ability to scan to any of my computers, scan to e-mail, scan to USB device, or scan to SD Card has made document storage for me a hassle free process.  Hpeprint makes it just so easy to print any document from any device connected to the internet and an e-mail account.I cannot speak for the fax function because in my personal and business use I have not had the need to send or receive faxes.  I also do not have a landline.  I suspect this is still a popular legacy service in our mobile society?  Pretty hard to get a fax quote on a smartphone.The unit is quite large and a bit on the heavy side.  You will need a good size footprint.  The wifi reciever on the unit is very strong (goes through two floors and into a closed closet).  So far no errors and clean prints.  Very fast shipping from Amazon.",
533,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,6,9,8-Apr-12,A17DZ7YEFWAM1I,HP officejet 8600 two-tray pro plus--A frustrating boondoggle,"I second a prior review in the following, also my exact experience: 'I was really, really, really looking for an all-in-one that could print legal sized paper and print envelopes easily. This does neither. It does have a legal sized flatbed for the scanner which led me to think that it could print legal sized paper. No such luck. Printing envelopes one at a time is possible but only if you remove the paper tray, remove all the paper in the tray, insert the envelope (or envelopes), print, remove the paper tray, re-insert the paper and re-insert the paper tray. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible.'Furthermore, I was doubly sucked in and ordered a second tray for printing legal and envelopes.  I spent hours with tech support, which I had no trouble reaching, trying to get one of the two trays to print only envelopes and the other only letter size.  I have stamps.com and called them and they said that they get a lot of calls on the 8600 and helped me download the software for the 6500 which actually works for the stamps.com printing of envelopes, but only on the Stamps.com site-thank you Stamps.com tech support.But, back to the HP software nightmare. I now have envelopes in tray 1, letter size in tray 2.  However, when doing diagnostics or print head cleaning etc. the HP automatically, despite the settings, defaults to tray 1 with the envelopes.  Can I tell you how very difficult it is to use this printer with the temperamental software. Furthermore, I must hand reset the printer each time to pick up from tray 2.  Furthermore, I try to save ink by printing in greyscale and all black, but the HP keeps resetting to use all the colors. I can't help to think that HP is now using some cut-rate outfit in Shanghai to lower labor costs and boost the bottom line for the Packard family, but not please the customer.  Perhaps they can get away with this for a while, but I would not buy stock in this company as they are headed for the exit is this is an indicator of their quality control.",
534,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,4,5,1-Apr-12,A2BLZE8DW2LTFU,Very happy with this printer,"My HP 7100 was showing its age -- the worst thing about it was that the auto document feeder would feed a page or 2 and then get hung up -- so it was time for a new one.I did a lot of research, and like others have said, narrowed it down to this one and the Epson Workforce 845. The reviews of the Epson pointed out flimsier construction, higher cost of ink, and a couple of other things that didn't sound like a good fit for me. So I went with HP 8600 Plus and am very pleased with it.The box it comes in is pretty big, but at 64 I was able to get it into my car, out of my car into the house, remove the old one, unpack this one and lift it up onto the printer stand. Set up was a breeze on my Mac equipment, all the bells and whistles work perfectly, and eprint is pretty cool.Many reviewers say they can't get the 8600 Plus to load card stock. This worried me a lot so I just tried it. It didn't load the card stock when I put a sheet in the tray on top of regular paper, but when I took out the regular paper and loaded the card stock, it printed fine. I selected card stock when printing and had no trouble.I love the auto document feeder. I made a pdf out of about 40 pages and not one jam or glitch. The fax function is better than the old models, too. With the 7100 I couldn't leave the phone line plugged into it -- it thought every call was a fax no matter how I tweaked the settings. This one allows for my answering machine and hasn't once mistaken a voice call for a fax.All in all, I love it -- this all-in-one is worth every penny!",

It arrived perfectly, took it out of the box, plugged it in, followed directions to a T.  That's when the issues started.  It says something is wrong with the printer, the touch display doesn't work properly, and it is officially getting returned.  I guess I have one of the defective ones.  I really wanted this to be the right printer, but now I have to go back to the drawing board.",
536,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,3,3,29-Mar-12,A1WWVTKKSXY4HL,HP tech support phone number,"Just received my printer, want to say this while it is fresh on my mind. I could not find a tech support phone number (if you need tech support) in the instructions/setup papers etc., so I am listing the number here because I had a difficult time finding it. HP Customer Care for Home: 800-474-6836, for business 800-334-5144. The support was decent but not fantastic. There are limits on what a person can do from China (or Indonesia or wherever) but she was courteous and understood me although I had a wee bit of difficulty understanding her. Make sure the duplexer, which you will have to insert into the rear, is clicked all the way in on both sides. My paper wouldn't feed until I got that right. The printer also initially said my ink was leaking somewhere, but it wasn't, and it took a printer restart to help it overcome that hurdle. When any print job or command gets bogged down on this printer (fax failure, ink leaking, photo print from software besides HP), it seems the only way to resolve the issue is to turn it off and then on again. Otherwise, so far, so good except couldn't get the fax to work even with the tech support lady. I will post again later if this printer turns out to be a disappointment.",

Ridiculously easy to set up.  Just make sure you lion users go to [...] an get the drivers there, not the CD.Also, really easy to print from my iPad!Also, if you scan a lot.

He informed me that over time I would save money because the ink cartridges for canon were so much more expensive when you considered how many pages per cartridge you can print.Then when I got it home I couldn't believe how awesome it was.  It's sleek and has a cool little touch screen pad.  But what's more is that I can set up an email and email the printer things to print off.  It's fabulous!  It was super easy to set up and I haven't had any problems with it since I purchased it.Favorite Features:Wireless PrintingEasy Set upTwo Sided Print (seriously this is awesome)Easy Load TrayThe ONLY reason that it doesn't have five stars is that it has been super noisy when two side printing.

540,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,0,0,27-Mar-12,A31DWOO7RTH11E,Great machine but HPNetworkCommunicator.exe just a bit annoying,"I was needing a color multi-function printer for scanning, printing and copying for home use. Faxing was not a requirement but ethernet connectivity was. After comparing various models in local stores and on-line, I bought the HP 8600 Plus. Amazon offered a better price than any local store and, as it turned out, shipping was faster than I expected.Setup of the printer was a breeze. It was straightforward with nothing out of the ordinary. Ink cartridge installation was simple. Replacement when the time comes should be also. Separate color ink cartridges is the way to go and is an added plus.Now after one month, I've used all of the 8600 features without problems (except faxing as it is not connected to any phone line). My in-home network is not wireless enabled, hence my ethernet connectivity requirement. Connectivity to my primary computer (Windows 7 64-bit) was established with ease once the printer was plugged into its local network switch and was on my network.After installing, connecting and using the HP 8600 Plus for several hours, I started noticing that my mouse pointer kept getting 'grabbed' every 15 seconds or so. The culprit turned out to be the recently installed 'HPNetworkCommunicator.exe' in 'Program Files/HP/HP Officejet Pro 8600/bin'. Apparently whether the printer is on, off, or in standby/sleep mode, HP's computer software checks its network connectivity and grabs or freezes the mouse pointer when doing so.I circumvented the issue by renaming the '.exe' to '.exeORIG' whenever I wasn't using the printer for network printing or for scanning documents to the computer. Scanning to other devices and copying work fine without that exe running - it's only needed for the desktop and printer to communicate. Whenever I need my computer to 'see' the printer again, I just rename the '.exeORIG' back to '.exe' and everything works as it should. When completed, I again rename it back to '.exeORIG' to avoid the constant interruptions.I don't know if that HP software issue is unique to ethernet connectivity, Windows 7 or if it exists with other installations of the printer and software. Regardless for something that should run in the background without impact, the 'HPNetworkCommunicator.exe' is much too disruptive while working with mouse-oriented programs on the computer.Despite the aggravation - since the rename 'fix' works for me - I give the HP8600 plus 4 stars. It does everything I need it to do - scanning photos or documents into jpg or pdf, one-sided or double-sided color printing and copying.",
541,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,10,11,21-Mar-12,A27KE9FL663AES,First printer I ever bought that I'm actually happy with.,"HISTORYI finally got frustrated enough with my gigantic Brother MFC6490CW that I decided to replace it.  I'd originally abandoned my loyalty to HP printers, and switched to Brother, due to the bloated and intrusive software I had to use with my old OfficeJet 6110.  Unfortunately, the Brother had unreliable communications.  So it's back to HP.DEMOGRAPHICSMy wife and I both work from home so we really do need a fast, reliable, affordable, all-in-one type of printer that can work with multiple platforms such as Windows 7, Windows XP, OS X, and iOS.  We don't do a lot of photo or color printing so while it's something that's nice to have, it doesn't have to be top notch.  If we really need to print a photo we just take the file to Target or Walgreens, and if we need to create pretty, color brochures, we go to Kinko's.  This is a productivity oriented printer so if you need perfect color prints, you won't be happy with the results here.SETUP & INSTALLThe touchscreen interface is really quite nice; I'm not sure why everyone complains about it.  It's not a capacitive touchscreen like your smartphone (I'm guessing it's a resistive touchscreen) so it requires a little more force to activate than your smartphone.  This is hardly a big deal.  I'm not typing an essay on the thing, I just need it to respond to a few inputs now and then.  Because it's a touchscreen, it's able to dynamically change during setup to make setup intuitive.  No more guessing which button you need to press to do something.  It also has neat little videos that play on the screen during setup to show you how to do something, like install the ink cartridges, or any accessories.Following the recommendations of online reviews I read, I downloaded the software online rather than use the provided CD.  The software installed without a hitch on the Windows machines, found the printer, and was ready to go.  The software the Mac almost went in without a hitch, but for some reason the 'scan to computer' function wasn't available.  I re-ran the setup wizard and it magically appeared.So once that's all done, you are ready to go.  There's a lot of tweaking that you can still do though so if things aren't perfect, don't be disappointed.PERFORMANCEThe print quality is acceptable.  If you want to print photos for framing, don't buy this printer.  If you want to print fancy brochures, don't buy this printer.  This is an office printer.  It's actually in the name, 'OfficeJet'.  If you want a photo printer, HP has a solution for that and they call it 'PhotoSmart'.  Marketing people are so clever aren't they?  Anyway, the print quality is good enough for an office environment where you plan on printing document to share with colleagues, clients, or collaborators.  Also, this printer is fast, or at least faster than any other printer we've had in the office.  The only downside to fast is that you have to keep the output tray extended or your documents will be strewn all over the floor.FEATURESThe whole HP ePrint thing is new to me so you'll have to forgive me for getting excited about something that might be old hat.  My work PC (Windows XP) uses a VPN to connect to HQ and some underlying IT settings mean that once I hook up to the VPN, I can no longer print to my network connected printer, including this one.  With HP ePrint, however, I now have a clever workaround now!  For one thing, if I'm using Google Chrome as a browser and want to print something from there, I can use Google Cloud Print to send the document to my printer.  Setup of the HP ePrint feature is easy and free.  Unfortunately if I want to print something like a Word Document, I have to e-mail that document to my printer's e-mail address.  This isn't especially difficult, but it means I now have a bunch of large documents cluttering up my SENT folder.  The printer can handle most common documents types such as Word, PDF, text, etc...  The advantage here is that I can print to the device from any device with e-mail anywhere in the world.  Just send the file as an attachment to YOUR_ADDRESS@hpeprint.com and you're done.We don't send or receive many faxes so we don't have a dedicated fax line, but when we do need to send or receive a document, it's really nice if it just works.  Having to unplug and swap phone cables isn't a lot of fun and we don't have a lot of time to stand next to the printer waiting to see if an incoming call is a fax so we can press the RECEIVE button.  Many of the printers we've used before claim to have the ability to intercept incoming fax calls, but we've never had one work right.  This is the first exception.  Simply tell the printer what your phone/fax configuration and it adjusts its behavior to work.  In our case we have an answering machine.  The printer listens in on the call after the answering machine answers.  If it hears the beep beep beep of an incoming fax, it intercepts the call and receives the fax.  We have it setup to just store incoming faxes as a PDF document on our server rather than print them, but you can also have it send the faxes to you as an e-mail.Scanning is where we had the most pain with our old Brother.  The software would work maybe 75% of the time and no amount of troubleshooting could ever change that; it just depended on luck.  With the HP, those days seem to be over.  Scans, whether initiated from the printer or our workstations, go through without a hitch.  The nice part about scanning on this thing is that you have many options about how to handle your scan.  When operating the scan from the printer you can send it to your computer, a mapped network drive, an e-mail recipient, or an SD card.  You can also specify whether to save the file as a PDF, JPG, or TIFF.  You can have an address book stored on the printer for the purposes of e-mail documents, but alas you have to manually enter it; I've not found a way to import an address book.BOTTOM LINEI'm happy with the printer.  The price, features, and quality of print are exactly what we were looking for.  The quality of construction and the quality of the software are what I would expect from something in this price range.  The printer is a bit large, but again, it's an office printer.  Don't buy this for someone living in a dorm room; they will hate you.  This printer has restored my faith in HP printers and I'm seriously considering buying a PhotoSmart printer so we can avoid those very occasional trips to Target or Kinko's.",

Don't know how to fix so bought what I thought would do same.  The 8600 Pro is nice and set up easy and does all normal functions well.  I have the 8600A premier at work and thought this would be similar (only without the 2nd paper drawer that is broken already).  To my surprise:  this 8600 Pro won't feed heavy paper! You can't see the paper tray without pulling it out.  How do you feed an envelope?  You open tray pull out paper, put in envelop, adjust the guides and close and pray.  No bypass, no opportunity to just stick it in like the 7310 or like the 8600A Premier.  What a pain.  After seeing this feed I can't wait to be annoyed printing pictures!  Let me go do that and come back...not same paper size options...yup...tray out, 2 hands to load photo paper and be careful as guides are flimsy...funny, won't print borderless either!  But, actually gives paper options that say 'thick plain paper'.  Wonder why it will feed photo paper but not thick paper.  Got photos printed but don't match my album which is all borderless.  Scanner and faxing are great though so I guess I'll just be annoyed every time I want thick paper or photos.  HP should not make so many models.  Just perfect existing ones!",

I've owned 5-6 multifunctional all-in-one printers dating back to the mid-1990s when they first came out.  The ink cartridge case on my Brother MFC-885CW cracked and so I did quite a bit of research to find a new multifunctional device.  It came down to the HP Officejet Pro 8600 and the Epson Workforce 845.  Having purchased an HP computer last year (which runs great), I decided to go with HP.  I was very disappointed.  It was difficult to set-up (most of my family and friends consider me the 'computer guy' in the house) and the paper kept jamming, especially when trying to print double-sided.  It also printed slower than my 3-yr old Brother printer.  In the end, I took it back to the store and decided to get the Epson Workforce 845, which was a huge upgrade (and cheaper).",

546,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,8,9,12-Mar-12,A2VXAD01MZ7N12,Pleasantly surprised with Mac compatibility,"I fear this review might get lengthy, but I really wanted to give good information I myself was looking for online before I made the decision to purchase this printer.I'm a Mac user.  I had a series of Canon multi-function printers (MX860, MX870, MX882) over the years until a couple of weeks ago when the MX882, like its predecessors, inexplicably died.  Frustrated with Canon printers and the way they guzzle ink and are flimsily built, I decided to rethink my choice of Mac compatible printers and examine all of the readily-available units on the market.I like the concept of an all-in-one, and being a home user who only occasionally prints photos, scanning is more important to me, and needing an automatic document feeder (ADF) has proven to be more useful than I thought, so that was an important feature in my purchasing decision.  While there may be better photo printers out there, with specialized inks (gray, etc.), this unit has the standard 3-tank CMY color inks, but since I print photos so infrequently I would likely be just as happy with a good quality 3 color ink printer.I already have a Brother duplexing b/w laser printer on my network and love it.  My printing is more black-and-white anyway but occasional color and scanning is important.Things I was looking for: solid Mac compatibility (with OS X Lion).  Air Print compatibility (if possible).  Ethernet wired connectivity (don't care about WiFi).  Network scanning.  Automatic duplex printing.The Lexmark units looked good on paper, but apparently suffer in Mac compatibility department.  So too Epson, apparently.  Wouldn't go back to Canon (which seems to offer the best Mac support and Mac compatible software suite, even with OS X Lion).Ultimately I chose this printer.  So far, I'm really happy I did.Let me get this out of the way immediately - it comes with 4 'starter' inks.  I don't know how much I'll be able to print with them before having to buy new cartridges, but separate ink tanks for black and colors is an absolute requirement -- and I like the idea of being able to use 'XL' ink cartridges, which should be good for about 700 color pages of output and up to 2,000 b/w pages.  The other thing that isn't optimal about this unit is that the scanner technology is CIS, not CCD.  CCD in my opinion produces much higher quality scans, but units that have CCD scanning sensors in them cost a lot more money (Canon MG8220 for example).Setup -- quite easy...  Ahead of time, go buy some decent printer paper.  Better quality than the stuff that is  coarse recycled general purpose copy stock.  My local office supply depot had 625 sheet high brightness quick dry paper for inkjets for four bucks a pack.  Snap in the duplexing unit on the back, snap in the four starter inkjet cartridges, use the touch screen to walk through the setup process, and you're up and running.  If you're a Mac user with OS X Lion, don't use the included CD, they tell you not to, instead download the install disk image from HP's website and go from there.  It went well, quickly, and it works great.Features - quite good.  You configure the printer for network scanning by configuring computers you want to be able to save the scans to across the network.  Configure the computer name, the share name, the id and password to use, and it's good to go.  I configured my home NAS as one destination, my iMac as another.  Also configure the printer to be able to receive e-mail from anywhere in the world and it will print the e-mail and any supported attachments (you can limit who it's allowed to print e-mail from).  Also configure your printer to scan and send e-mails right from the printer.  There's so much you can do right from the printer without needing a computer.  Plug in a supported memory card or USB thumb drive and print photos right from there.  Scan to USB thumb drive or memory card.  Print from your iPhone or iPad using AirPrint.  It all works really well so far.The scanning software included with Lion can work with this printer right over the network.  HP also includes  scanning software that lets you do similar activities.  You can also download 3rd party scanning software like VueScan which I tried for grins, it works great with this scanner.Really, unless this thing demonstrates flaky behavior or that it guzzles ink like the Canon did, I'm really sold on it and couldn't be happier with my purchase.  I really expect that once I buy the XL black cartridge, I will make this my primary printer and maybe put the networked laser printer out to pasture.One note, it's kinda big...  The ADF sits tall on top of the unit and to scan you need to tilt the document cover (including ADF) back to access the scanner glass; make sure you have clearance above and behind.  Oh, and the scanner glass is legal size (8.5 x 14).",
547,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,4,6,12-Mar-12,AKMWKYH0J77HU,Epson or HP,"I sent 1.5 hours comparing the scanning, print quality, and print speed of numerous 200+ dollar printers.  It came down to Epson and HP, namely the Epson 845 and HP 8600 pro plus.  I'll make this easy, the HP is the way to go.  The only strength I could find on the Epson is retail pricing, but HP discounts are so strong that you can get a HP 8600 pro plus for 17 dollars more then the Epson 845.  The Epson at Micro Center would print horizontal lines on copies and scans, the HP has much less of this(but there were noticeable horizontal lines).  The HP prints much faster, period. They both take extra large ink tanks as an option.  I have never seen faster ink jets then the hp in this price range.  Yes, Epson claims it is faster at two sided, but it is marginal, in fact I would say that it is pure marketing of taking your one mild advantage and strongly touting it.  The HP 8600 are very solid, don't have flimsy paper trays, and have one killer app that makes this a no decision....apps.Most of the apps are worthless, however, some apps, like the ability to to scan directly to google docs, are, if you use google docs to run a paperless office like me, a dream come true.  Plus there will be more apps in the future.  The apps are very robust, especially with the color touch screen.  Also, the printer updates its firmware over the net and it pretty quick about it.  I don't know if or how Epson 845 compares.The wireless integration between computer and printers is seamless and very easy to setup, I don't know how the Epson compares, but it can't be any easier then HP.  The packaging on the HP is the smartest I have seen, the printer is in a bag that you can easily lift out of the box.  It is a very considerate feature and makes getting the printer out of the box quick and easy.The Epson has a few notables strengths, price, the fact it flips the page back to face up on two sided scans (at least it seemed to do that), and less confusing naming.  HP has a 8600, 8600 pro, 8600 pro plus, and 8600 pro plus premium.  Its crazy, and the prices are all over the place.  I was willing to pay 300 for the pro plus but then it went on sale for 225 at BB, its 217 here.  If you are worried about $50 between printers then don't by a printer, the ink over time is what kills and the 50 you save will be nothing compared to the 200 in ink with even light usage, at least these printers have XL tanks that save you roughly 50% over time which is huge given the cost.  The key is to find deals on ink, and oem ink is the way to go if you can.So I give the HP 5 stars, and the Epson 3.  Its good enough, but does not match the HP line in software sophistication, quality of construction, and speed.  The level of innovation in the HP is really shocking at this price.",

It obviously had been defective from the beginning as the previous owner left a book with a picture of a red apple on the copy glass - presumably testing the ability of the printer to print red. Even after following HPs troubleshooting steps (and wasting expensive ink in the process), the magenta never worked. I tried it with the ink cartridges that came with the printer and again with brand new ones I had purchased. Thankfully I was able to easily return the printer. I ended up purchasing another Officejet Pro 8600 (just not the Plus model, as I decided the extra features weren't worth the additional money) because I didn't want to waste the $140 worth of ink I had purchased and opened. To my relief, the new printer seems to be working flawlessly.I didn't test everything else on this printer as it seemed pointless with the magenta not working.",

This came 'bundled' and i'm not sure what extra that gets you.  Maybe a few cords, but if you are going wireless, you don't need them.Pros: Like the both the scan to email and sending the printer an email from my iphone and it printing the document.  Quite nice features.  Printing seems decent.  We print a lot of color brochures and it is about the same quality as our old hp6480.  Didn't see much color difference between normal and best though.  Not as rich color as say a laser or probably some of the better photo printers.Cons: Scanner is not great.  Have to be at at least 200 dpi for it to come out clear and that puts one page at round 1MB.  We are using this for our real estate biz, and will not be able to scan a 20 page contract and actually email it to someone, since it would be 22MB.  Currently can not refill ink at costco.Still a little up in the air about whether we are going to keep it.

I had read this on a few other reviews but I don't need card stock often so figured it wasn't a big deal. When I asked the salesman about it at Office Max, he assured me that was only if I was printing 10 or 20 card stock pages at a time. He assured me that it would not be a problem if I were just to print a few at a time. However, as I tried to print one single sheet of card stock today, it would not print.

But, the print/scanning software distributed with the printer (different from the software packages for the 7700 and 8500)is terrible and even though the diagnostic said everything was fine there were network communication issues.Now that I finally got the PC and the printer communicating over the network after wasting about 4 hours, the SCAN SPEED of the 8600 scanning at 200 DPI is about 1/4 of the scan speed of the 7700 scanning at 300 DPI!  I am hoping HP will issue a software update to correct this serious deficiency, because the 8600 is essentially useless otherwise for scanning multipage documents.",

I tried printing photos.I have two type of photo paper Home:1)Genuine HP 'Arm&Leg cost' photo paper.2)The very popular Costco (kirkland) premium photo paper.I had no problem with the HP paper.The only way I managed to have the printer feed the kirkland paper,was by sticking a piece of masking tape (as found on a forum), on theback of the paper. This gave enough grip to the picking roller, tomake the paper work with this printer.The same paper works flawlessly in other HP printers and other brands.If you plan on using this printer for photo printing without using HP photopaper, I suggest you to google 'hp 8600 will not feed photo paper'Feel free to share your experiences (successful or not) with me.Ben",

Just follow the instructions on the LCD, and you're good to go within 10-15 minutes.  It recognized my wireless connection without a hitch.  I was impressed with the left side compartment, its new ergonomic design allows for the replacement of the cartridges without the need to yank up the base of the printer.  The additional screen real estate on the display is a welcomed change to the 2.45' one in my previous HP 6500a; everything is so much crisper.  I've only used it for basic printing tasks thus far, but I'm pleased with the quality of the print-outs.  Its boot up time is slightly less than my old printer, but not by much.All in all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase, and happy HP finally got it right!",

Like the ability to scan and email directly from the control panel on the scanner.  Unable to setup newtwork scan to server properly, however did not spend that much time on it and do not really need it.  Able to scan direct to different computers on network fine, just not a shared network folder (not critical to us & could be a firewall issue on our end).  Have bought many HP printers and scanners and generally the equipment we spent over $600 for we have been please with.  However the equipment under 300 have not been happy with, until now after about a month of usage.  Have not printed much on it but seems to function fine.  OCR that comes with it works ok but not great, they want you to buy a premium version if that is something one needs (I do not).  For scanner (connected via network) and backup printing I highly recommend.",

Large and bulky but still visually appealing. Print/scan/copy quality is excellent and fast.HP alerts are a bit annoying for every time they decide to make an update. The tray HAS to be pulled out when printing pages, otherwise printouts will fly all over the place. If there's not that much paper left in the tray (like 10 pages), the feeder grabs them all and causes a paper jam every time, so keep an eye on the paper levels.Other than that, excellent buy.

It was really fast, especially in draft quality. It did a nice job copying double-sided documents and printing them double-sided.

I was looking for a new machine that was wireless and had good speed to it.  The touch screen is very nice and the set-up was very simply.  I was a little nervous about setting up a wireless device but when you just follow the on-screen directions the HP did all of the work for you.  I would not hesitate if you are looking for a device that does all-in-one and is wireless.  I also got a great price from Amazon and it shipped quickly.,

But let me tell you emphatically, I am beyond happy that I did.  When I first got it, I let it sit for two weeks in the box because I was so busy but the HP it was replacing was dying a slow death.  I finally hooked it up last week and WOW.  AWESOME would be a major understatement.  The connection to the internet is awesome.  The speed at which it prints is astounding.  The quality of the print job is excellent.  The ease of hooking the whole thing up, putting in the ink--you name it, was all easy to do.  It looks sleek and super stylish all the features, Copy, Fax, Scan and Print (including double sided) work like a charm.  The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to get something from my smart phone to print to it yet but that's next on my list.  I would HIGHLY suggest this printer for the office or home.  I can't believe I only payed just over $200 for this printer.  HP is now back on my Happy List.",
586,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,332,338,25-Jan-12,AR6QTTIQ7P4DV,Excellent economical multi-function machine,"I'll start by saying that I think this is an excellent machine.My journey of buying a multi-function printer started with purchasing an HP Officejet Pro 8500 all-in-one.  This was a top-rated machine, and I was excited when it arrived.  Unfortunately, the particular 8500 that we received, although easy to setup, jammed constantly.  After a week of jamming headaches, I headed online to Amazon to arrange for a return.  When considering a replacement, I saw that the 8600 series OfficeJet printers had arrived, so I needed to consider them as well.  At only about $25 more than I had paid for the 8500, I took the plunge.The first decision with the 8600 was which of the three models to order.  The basic model was quite attractively priced, and has features similar to the Plus and Pro models.  The Plus model's big advantage (in our case) was the larger display.  Other features separating it from the basic model are the larger automatic document feeder (50 vs 35 sheets) and a slightly faster print speed (20 vs 18 ppm black and 16 vs 13 ppm color, according to the HP website.)  Had we upgraded to the 'Premium' model, we could have added an additional 250-sheet paper tray.  The Premium model might be appropriate for a small workgroup which does does lots of printing, but in our case, would be extreme overkill based on our printing volumes -- one ream of paper can last us many months!Display: This printer went to my mother-in-law's house - and she's not the most tech-savvy consumer.  We chose the 'Plus' model because of the larger display - and it was a great choice!  The display is great - large, bright, and intuitive.  My mother-in-law has no problem completing most tasks and following the very good on-screen video instructions.Configuration: The printer was easy to configure without even connecting to a computer using the on-screen display to connect to the wi-fi network.  In all, it probably took about 10-15 minutes, most of which was allowing the printer to complete its self-configuration checks and print head alignment.  The software was easy to install on the computer, and the computer was able to discover the printer on the network almost instantly using the drivers on the included CD-ROM.Printing: Print quality is quite good and very fast -- the last time I purchased an inkjet printer was about 7 years ago, and the one this one replaced was 8 years old.  Speed has come a long way in that time!Copying: Again, this was quite simple.  I especially like the easy on-screen options for dealing with two-sided originals and copies, allowing for all duplexing options without any additional fuss or difficulty.Faxing: Also a straightforward operation, there were a few points worthy of comment.  First, the fax self-configuration was great, and I appreciated the self-check during the setup process so that sending a 'test fax' to someone was not necessary.  Also, it worked fine with the AT&T U-Verse digital phone service -- not all fax devices play well with digital phone services, so this was very nice.  My mother-in-law also commented about how she appreciated that you can enter the destination fax number before inserting the document to be faxed into the feeder - a nice feature as the destination fax number is usually at the top of the front page, which is often hidden by the document feeder once inserted.Scanning: The network scanning was quite easy, and worked seamlessly - something not true of all network scan devices.  My previous experience had been that devices scanning over the network have some usability problems, and that they work best when connected directly to the computer.  No issues here, however - it worked great right out of the box with no physical connection to the computer.Driver: The included drivers on the CD-ROM worked just fine, as well as those downloaded from the HP website.  My one small complaint is that when auto-discovering the printer using Windows 7, Windows fails to install a usable driver.  The user must first go to the HP website, download an appropriate driver, then install the driver directly.  These extra steps were time-consuming and annoying - but not enough for me to deduct a star.Ink: The ink cartridges were very easy to insert and replace.  I particularly appreciate that they are simple units and don't have the tape-covered electrical contacts common on the older generation of cartridges which could sometimes come off during installation.Overall: I give this printer a strong recommendation, and 5 stars.  You may need to decide which model is best for you -- depending on pricing, the larger display of the 'Plus' model might not be worthwhile, and the price of the basic model is quite attractive.  For us and our given user, the larger display was key and worth the extra cost.  I'd buy one again!",

So I am keeping the Photosmart for pictures and the 8600 for all other duties.While the 8600 has capability for wireless printing, you are not able to have both wireless to the printer and a wired network connection at the same time...no matter, I have it connected to my home network and use the wireless network connection to print with the 8600.

The setup and configuration for the printer, scanner, and fax was simple and intuitive. The Google Cloud Printing setup was great and simple as well. Print and scan quality and usability are great. Overall, our initial experience was completely positive. A very annoying driver download is the 'HP Driver Utility' which installs a bunch of stuff you don't need. Avoid that at ALL costs!The really ugly wart for this product is the Fax utility and functionality. The only fax feature that works in the software is print to fax. There's no way to setup and configure a fax cover page (basic). It doesn't save the failed faxes, so you have to start over 100% every time. There's no addition and saving of contacts or integration to very common software, such as Outlook or Gmail Contacts. After four attempts and 3 configuration setting changes (on the device itself not through the software) we finally had a successful fax. But....no confirmation page was generated electronically or on paper. The Fax feature is a complete and total fail. Don't buy this if you ever want to fax. I don't even have the emotional energy to attempt scan to fax. Maybe someone else can give their experience.Seriously considering returning. Print = great. Scan = great. Fax = total fail. 66% functionality is not a passing grade.",

I even tried to 'crowd source' the information and customer experience on this one.  I have never been more disappointed in my life.  HP used to be a respectable name in printers.  Now, I would RUN and not walk from any HP product on the face of the earth.- incomplete description of it's capabilities. I was really, really, really looking for an all-in-one that could print legal sized paper and print envelopes easily. This does neither. It does have a legal sized flatbed for the scanner which led me to think that it could print legal sized paper. No such luck. Printing envelopes one at a time is possible but only if you remove the paper tray, remove all the paper in the tray, insert the envelope (or envelopes), print, remove the paper tray, re-insert the paper and re-insert the paper tray. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible.- Abysmal support.  I tried to contact HP support when trying to get the machine set up and it was impossible. There is no direct line either by e-mail or phone. There are only 'forums'. I tried Twitter and they were damn slow to respond to that and weren't really helpful anyway.- defective product in the box. It comes with some 'starter' ink. Well, the black ink didn't work so off to Staples I went to buy another black ink cartridge which bumped up the cost of the all-in-one.- terrible manual.  The manual - which you need to download from their website since it doesn't come in the box - is scant on information and hardly worth the time to a) find it online and b) download it.I was on the verge of getting the Epson Workforce 845 and I should have for the same price.",

Set up instruction were sorely lacking but my intuition worked well and I got it set up quickly.  If this printer lasts as long as my old one did it will more than be worth the price.

It answered my requirement for a seamless wireless printer for my home network that would support printing from either windows or mac computers as well as ipads.  Per the many reviews, installation was easy and installing on the mac, the warning not to use the included CD but to download the latest software from the HP website was a blessing.  After installing on my IMac, I successfully installed the software on a HP Windows machine and three Mac laptops and all printed successfully.My disappointment is with the scanning function....I will admit I may have misinterpreted the information on the top of the box 'Automatic two-sided print, scan, copy, fax' to mean it would scan both sides of a document automatically.  The online HP tech suggested the statement meant it would automatically print two-sided documents but the scan, copy, fax was just one-sided.  Since it didn't say that, I asked what he could base that statement on...he simply asked if I had any more questions.  A complete waste of time dealing with an online tech who basically was providing me 'CANNED' answers and really had no clue.So, I'm on the fence as to whether to box the thing up and ship it back and look for something else..  I was using a Canon, WHICH DOES DO DOUBLE SIDED SCANNING HP,  but it had seen better years and was starting to drop off our wireless network without explanation.  I had hoped this would be the fix, especially given the price and the size of this printer.  To think HP can't provide software that allows for double sided document scanning is a puzzle.",

Although I quickly learned that I can't do 2-sided printing with color graphics, even in draft mode, without it jamming. The printer doesn't allow enough time for one side to dry before printing the other side. My printer has to set in a corner and it is a real pain to get to the printer, turn it around and access the back to pull out a jammed sheet. I have used HP products for many years and this is a flaw that HP should have addressed prior to releasing the product.Overall, I still like the printer and hope to get years of service.

600,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,33,35,31-Dec-11,A1F31YGE47Q1RZ,I Love This Printer,"The HP 8600 Plus was so easy to set up; the hardest thing was getting it out of the box. It took me about twenty minutes to set it up for my wireless network. I didn't use the enclosed driver CD because I found the latest ones on hp.com and downloaded them in minutes. Make sure to delete any old software from previous printers on your computer before doing this for a smooth install. One key feature that made me decide between this hp and an epson was that if you run out of black on the hp, the other colors can combine to make black so that you can finish printing. The same is true if you run out of color, this printer will let you print your documents in black. I have read that epson printers will stop working if any one color runs out. This has to be extremely frustrating when something needs to be printed and nothing happens. I can print on my iPad and iPhone with no additional apps and eprint where you can email anything to the printer and print regardless of your location is easy to do. There is even a light inside the printer that lets you see clearly when you are changing the ink. According to the specifications on hp.com, you can print on card stock 90-110 lbs. The only negative is that you do have to remove your normal paper in the tray when using envelopes or other specialty paper. If you print many envelopes a separate tray can be purchased or look into the premium model of the 8600 which comes with two trays.

One can also print wirelessly to an Apple mobile device like an iPad, iPod Touch, iPhone etc. via Apple Air Print.Un-PackingMake no mistake the 'HP Officejet Pro 8600 Plus' is a hefty printer checking in a 21 pounds.  And while the unit does not require a two-man lift, it will require some finesse to get it out of the box and onto a flat surface.  One unboxed it took me a little less than 15 minutes to completely assemble the printer including the duplexer unit.  Thankfully the power supply is built-in, so no heavy power brick to find a place for.Network SetupBefore connecting the HP Officejet Pro 8600 Plus network via Ethernet (RJ-45), or Wireless the decision must be made to utilize one or the other communications medium, but not both.  USB can be utilized with either configuration.  Since I wanted my iPad to 'speak' to the printer and print I installed the HP Officejet Pro 8600 Plus utilizing wireless and USB and I can print either way as well as utilize the scanner to print-to-computer.  Wireless set-up was effortless using DHCP; all I needed to know was the network WPA2 passcode.Wireless Printing & e-PrintOne of the selling points of the HP Officejet Pro 8600 Plus e-AIO is of course the ability of the iPad to print to the device either wirelessly (Air Print) or via e-Print.  I am happy to report that both work!As I stated above Apple IOS version 4.2 shipped with Air Print, which allows the iPad to wirelessly 'talk' to Air Print enabled printers like the HP Officejet Pro 8600 Plus.  Once the printer was set up on the wireless network I could see the printer on the iPad from Air Print enabled applications like Safari, select the printer and print. G that was it, no setup needed on the iPad.HP's e-Print also works like a charm, most of the time.  With e-Print the HP Officejet Pro 8600 Plus is assigned a customizable e-mail address to which one can forward e-mail's to be printed from iPad, iMac, iPod, or PC as long as the printer is connected to the Internet.  This feature works reasonably well; it is supposed to be able to print attachments, but this is a hit or miss proposition; i.e. sometimes it works, sometime not, sometimes it print half a page.  However, overall, I am pleased with e-print.Software InstallationMy HP Officejet Pro 8600 Plus is connected primarily to an Apple iMac 2.7GHz machine with 4GB RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X Lion Version 10.7.2. Out of the box the software disc will not work with Lion 10.7.2, so I had to download a software update from Apple and another from HP, but both worked seamlessly and I was able to get up and running with full functionality (including scan-to-computer) in under 15 minutes.  And I have to say for the record I like the iMac interface for the printer better than the Windows 7 interface.PrintingPretty straight forward; the software installation process installed a full set of print drivers which in turn give you complete control over the printing process, including two-sided printing.  The HP Officejet Pro 8600 Plus can also print from inserted USB flash drives and or MMC/SD Media cards.ScanningThe HP Officejet Pro 8600 Plus offers up both a 50-sheet ADF and flatbed scanner for use.  Initialing the scanning process can be accomplished from the included software, inserting a page(s) into the ADF, or the units control panel.  Once an item is placed into the ADF or on the flatbed scanner glass surface, you can push the Scan button on the front panel, at which time you choose where to scan to: Computer, USB Flash Drive, or Memory Card. Once a destination is chosen, you can then chose to scan to file (.PDF is an option), e-mail, or photo.Copy ProcessThis process, like printing is pretty straight forward; both color and black & white copies can be made, up to 99 at a time.  Because there is a duplexer installed two-sided copies can be made in a number of different configurations, including 1-side original/ 1-side copy; 1-side original/ 2-side copy; 2-side original/ 1-side copy; 2-side original/ 2-side copy.  Copies can also be enlarged up to 144%, or reduced down to 25% of original.Working with PhotosAs stated above, the HP Officejet Pro 8600 Plus will accept input from a number of commercially available portable memory storage devices, slots for which are located on the left hand side of the printer underneath the cartridge insertion flip down panel.  Simply insert the memory card and the photos it contains are displayed on the small 4.6' touch-screen color display on the right hand side of the unit.ConclusionOverall I like the HP Officejet Pro 8600 Plus e-AIO, because it works seamlessly with my iMac and I can print to it from my iPad. The design is a little austere; there are no buttons to push because everything is controlled from the color (touch screen) display panel, which might prove problematic if it ever decides not to work.  But, there is always the control set on the computer, so...The built-in wired Ethernet capability, coupled with USB and wireless make the HP Officejet Pro 8600 Plus e-AIO Inkjet Printer a versatile, flexible unit that is ideal for a small home office setting and well as workgroup setting.  If you or your small workgroup need a scanner/ copier/ printer/ fax, and need to print from your iPad--or other mobile device--in some form or fashion the HP Officejet Pro 8600 Plus should be given serious consideration.",

However, if you turn it off, but leave any computer on with the software installed to connect to it, there is one process: HPNetworkCommunicator, that will start and stop about every 5 seconds. This is HORRIBLE CPU waste, and interrupts other processes. HP has acknowledged the problem and said they will NOT fix it. Go check HP forums to see for yourself. This type of customer service will keep me away from any other HP products.Stay AWAY if this is for home use!",
607,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,10,13,16-Dec-11,A115F55TD6QRDI,"Great Printer, Fantastic Features","I replaced a Brother Color Laserjet Multifunction printer with this unit. The HP product is 1/3 of the price 1/5 of the weight and has more features than the brother device. Setup was easy, using the wizard on the device and then 'tweaking' using the software provided. Based on the data from others this device should be much lower cost of ownership in terms of printing than the Brother device too. I am despirately trying to find a flaw with the device, and as yet I cannot. In fact it's likely I will purchase a second unit for use in my personal office at work. It is great to see HP producing innovative devices with innovative features.",
608,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,36,40,16-Dec-11,A2H26VE2QC4WV,All the Bells & Whistles with Reliability & Quality,"I love this printer - the quality and speed are phenomenal for an all in one office/business printer. The best feature by far has to be AirPrint - the ability to wirelessly print from my iPhone/iPad without any hesitation. I also love that the printer has an email address so you can print while away from home simply by emailing it! Yes, the cost of the XL inks can be a little pricey, however the cost per sheet is quite low compared to other printers. This printer is full of tech - not that it's a selling point, but I even use the USB port in front to charge my iPhone lol. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this printer again!",
609,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,84,95,15-Dec-11,A11MS62VL8VJ66,"works well with Mac OS X Lion, after an initial hiccup","I purchased this printer to replace a Brother MFC 7820N multifunction laser printer, which was a great printer that interfaced well with my Mac for years.  I was initially skeptical of purchasing the HP because I have had problems with other HP printers.  I also read reviews on other sites saying the printer was not fully compatible with Mac OX X Lion.  But I decided the feature set was too irresistible not to give it a try.I received the printer from Amazon quicker than I expected and was excited to set it up.  Unfortunately, the setup was a nightmare from the moment that I turned the printer on.  The printer has a really nice touchscreen but no physical buttons other than the power button.  When you plug in the printer, the first thing that the setup program prompts you for is a language.  I pushed what I was thought was English but apparently my finger actually activated another language nearby and from that point forward I could not read any of the setup screen prompts.  I fumbled through a few buttons that I thought might work, but finally the process ended in an error message in a foreign language that I couldn't exit out of.  I called tech support, who tried to help me do a factory reset, but they actually couldn't figure out how to make the printer return to factory settings!  Apparently previous models had a combination of key presses that could factory reset the machine, but the touchscreen makes this process more complicated.  There is supposed to be an area of the panel that you push four or five times to bring up a service menu, but my touchscreen was completely unresponsive.So, HP sent me a replacement.  I was much more careful to select the language that I was familiar with this time.  Setup went smoothly this time.  As instructed in the package insert for Mac users, I used the Software Update on the Mac to get the latest driver.  I was up and running quickly, printing both from my Mac and also my iPhone and iPad via AirPrint. Very nice.  This printer is fast and delivers high quality text and graphics.I wasn't totally out of the woods yet though--I tried to scan a document to pdf using the printer, and got an error message that my computer was not properly setup for this.  When I tried to follow the onscreen instructions, I kept getting error messages.  So back to HP tech support I went, this time with an online chat.  I was guided through an uninstall and reinstall of the HP utility, which worked flawlessly.  I am now able to scan to pdf from the printer, and it also has a really cool feature that lets you send an email directly from the printer with the scanned document attached.  I have read reviews on other sites that these scanner functions are not supported in Lion, but I can assure you that they are.  If you are having trouble I would recommend contacting HP for a walkthrough.All in all, excellent printer and would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the issues I had with setup and needing to get a replacement sent.  At less than $200 this is a lot of printer for the money.  It has a larger footprint than the laser that it is replacing, but it isn't grossly oversized and looks very nice on a desk.",
610,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,23,28,15-Dec-11,A32RUSNXS6E7BB,So techy!,I went to a local office supply store to check out printers.  I saw this one and visually it was very striking.  sleek. dark.  I was looking for a laser printer but I noticed this did 23 ppm which is comparable to a laser.Then I saw all the features.  And then I researched the cost of ink.  It just turned out to be a way better product for my budget.I got a sweet deal here on amazon. And of course I am a prime member so i got it quick.This was the absolute easiest printer i've ever set up.  I didn't even need to turn on my laptop.  I was up and running in about 10 minutes. I even logged on to my wireless network. Boom. I was good to go!  I eventually turned on both my laptops to install the drivers.Which was quick.This is a feature rich product. It has apps...  so many worthless apps.  I deleted them all except for the coupon app.  I'm a cheapskate. whatever.  It has like a news app and yahoo news app and recipe app...  I'm a dude.  I could careless.I thought it was still cool tho.I also was able to set up an offsite printing address.  I can print anything I want (so long as its supported) from anywhere in the world... and it will show up on my printer. I was having lots of fun with that while I was at work.I haven't really tested how well it prints pictures but I'm more of a nerd.  I was doing double sided printing and copying. sending faxes.I really dig the LCD screen touchpad.  It shows full Caller ID info... its pretty bad ass.  I like this machine alot.,
611,XX,B005O55U2Y,5,64,72,12-Dec-11,A225G2TFM76GYX,Excellent Low Ink Cost Solution,In the past I have given HP very negative reviews on their printers for high per page ink costs.  This printer is a welcome relief.  The Printer set up without problems on a mixed Mac(10.7.2) and PC network(Win 7).  I set up the ePrint feature and it worked fine.  I then tested AirPrint using my iPad.  The copy function worked very well.  The only con and this is very minor is that the scan function seems to be slighly slower than I would have expected - but still good enough for most applications.All in all this is one excellent printer from HP.,

This printer obviously is a work horse and prints out quality prints and photes without hesitation.  Have tested it on almost everything without a glitch.

Highly recommend.  So far this has proven to be a quality product.  Using for iphone, ipad and wireless computer printing.",
613,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,1,1,6-Mar-14,A3233J6FHFY1SO,What a Dud!,"I bought this a year ago and set it up on my wireless network. It worked fine on every computer I have in my house, even though the HP software is annoying as hell. However, a very short time later, the printer started having communication issues. To resolve the problem I would have to spend an hour or so troubleshooting the issue and finally give up and re-install the printer; this had to be done with every computer in the house. A couple of weeks later, the same thing started happening again and I would repeat the procedure. Needless to say I did not enjoy using the printer.About 3 months ago both my wife and I got new laptops that have Windows 7. And although HP says it can print from Windows 7 the driver does not work. So we have been printing from our Kindles for the last 3 months since those are the only devices that seem to work with the printer.The last straw... about 2 weeks ago we had to replace the ink. Now there is an error message telling me to restart the printer. After doing so, I get the same message. It won't do anything now except use electricity. I like how it becomes a brick only after I changed the ink. Way to go HP. You don't make printers anymore, you make ink consumption systems. How's that stock price doing? Now I now why IT at work won't let us buy HP... they don't work. The last 2 printers I've had were HP and I had nothing but problems with them.I'm going to buy another printer today and it won't be an HP.",

So many harsh reviews. so many glowing reviews, what's a non-computer geek to do.  Well, when COSTCO had a sale with an unbeatable price, I dove right in.  No regrets, however my needs are simple.  It prints, copies, and scans  just fine, haven't tried the fax yet, but have no reason to question it.  So a printer with numerous bells and whistles but at a killer price is ideal.....and yet I knocked a star off.  It does show error messages for paper jams, which upon inspection do not exist....annoying but not a deal breaker.  So if your printing needs are basic or uncomplicated, this is a fine machine",

It was probably the easiest printer/technology system I've ever set up in my life. I had it up and running in about 10 minutes. It is so good, that my parents bought the same one a week later after they saw mine!!As for some of the reviews that mentioned about not only being able to print in black only when there is no ink in one of the color cartridges, I would suggest that you do your research prior to making a purchase and under the technology behind the printer. Different printers use different printing head systems. There is a great link on HP's website which discusses this in more depth and detail here [...]So as long as you're okay with that, it is an overall great buy and packs lots of features for the price.I use it moderately for personal use and this printer is considered a long-life print head integrated into a printer which has Individual Ink Cartridges (IIC) system.",
623,XX,B005O55U2Y,2,0,0,26-Feb-14,A9IFSLWBJ2ATQ,Day 2 and it's already messed up...,"After doing a lot of research, I purchased this printer to replace a very disappointing Brother all-in-one. It is packed with great features like automatic 2-sided printing, airprint capability to print from apple products, etc. I opened the box, and it is beautiful. Nice design. Touch screen worked great. Very user friendly set up. Within minutes I was able to print an email and a pdf from our iphones. The first time it jammed a couple of pages, but no big deal. I removed it and tried again, and they printed beautifully (both b/w). I then printed a photo from my iphone. It was decent quality. I went to bed last night happy with our new purchase. Today, I set up our Windows 8 laptop wirelessly with the supplied set up disc. Again, very easy to set up. I opened a pdf and sent it to print, and within seconds it started printing. Fabulous. Then it started sounding like paper crunching. It was eating the paper and printing everything at a slant. I told it to cancel printing and it stopped. I went back to the computer to try again but the printer started printing again on its own. Now it was eating the paper and printing big gray blocks/blobs instead of text. I went in through the computer to cancel the print job, and it stopped. I checked that the paper was in there correctly and removed and reinserted the ink cartridge. Everything seemed fine. I printed the pdf again with the same results - eating the sides of the paper, smearing, smudging, printing gray blocks, etc. I thought maybe there was something wrong with the pdf somehow, so I printed a test page from the printer menu, but it did the same thing. So very disappointing. This printer could be awesome IF it worked. I don't know if this is a common problem with this model or if I just got a lemon, but this piece of junk is going back.",

In the last year and a half i made no more than 3000 prints. Anyway i see online a troubleshooting video posted by HP. I try it. Still doesn't work. i call the service. They told me that they have no service anymore for jet printers. If troubleshooting doesn't work, u have to buy a new one. But grat, they make u discount. So basically if you need to replace a piece that costs 2$, instead i should have spent 250$ to get a new one. I asked around. HP and some others don't sell any more replacement parts. Not even to certified repairs centers. So if after a couple of years, once the warranty is expired, u need to replace even the most stupid part, you can't. And this for a machine that costed me 450$. Only Brother and Epson still distribute replacement parts. Be aware.",
628,XX,B005O55U2Y,1,3,8,24-Feb-14,A3FIXDUTK7FH4O,HP sinks to the bottom.,"It pains me to write this review; not because the printer is bad but because of how HP has sunk from the manufacturer of the finest test equipment in the world to an also-ran in the cheap printer market.  It's a riches-to-rags story unique in American commerce.The trouble began in 1999 when HP spun off the test equipment division and decided to compete with Japan and China in the fast-paced computer and printer business.  HP then hired Carly Fiorina as CEO, under whose tenure the value of the company was halved and extensive job losses were experienced.After a series of questionable acquisitions (Compaq, Palm, EDS, 3com), the company announced in May of 2012 that in response to a 30% decline in quarterly profits, the company would be forced to lay off 27,000 workers; in September that figure was revised to 29,000 and again in December to 34,000.In its desperate scramble for profits, it looks to me as if HP has cut every design corner imaginable in building this printer.  I know of two other people who bought these printers besides me, and all three failed after the warranty had expired.And most disturbingly, the failures seem to be due to lack of adequate design margin---plastic gears that break, parts that jam as they wear, and components that fail prematurely.  And there are NO repair parts available--if something breaks after warranty, you either fix the part yourself or scrap the printer.Sadly, this printer does beautiful work, so long as it holds together.  But it seems to be abnormally failure prone, and once it fails, it's history.  Prospective purchasers should look at the number of 5-star reviews for this printer versus the number of 1-star reviews; the sheer number of failures tell the story better than words.  Calculate the odds of getting a good one.  Then do the same thing for printers from Epson, Brother, Samsung, and others, and buy accordingly.",

Just for home use and to print stuff for classes.However, if you run out of ink in a single cartridge then you won't be able to print until you get a new one. This is a bs move but a smart one since it means more money for them. I ran out of cyan but still had a lot of black ink left. I just wanted to print in black ink but HP prevented the printing job until cyan was replaced. WTF? I should be allowed to print in black ink even if one color cartridge is depleted. Also, they have chip on the cartridges that prevents refills from working unless you have a backup one to switch between.If you guys don't mind the issue I just talked about then go ahead and buy the printer. It gets the job done and has a lot of cool features. However, that one issue ruined the experience for me and which is why I rated it 1 star.",

I have not tried scanning yet but, so far, am very pleased with the unit.  The only annoying thing, as with HP units, is that you have to remove the paper to print envelopes (can't use rear printing due to space constraints).",

Want to scan something quickly?  Not until this printer squirts out a bunch of costly in for the next 10min.  I recommend staying away from HP printers!!!"

Now that we have the Cloud Drive set up, I couldn't ask for anything better.  Everytime my husband uses it he says, I can't believe what a great printer this is!",
639,XX,B005O55U2Y,2,1,1,17-Feb-14,A1HPXK912834PP,Can't handle much scanning,"I've purchased two of these machines now.  The first one quit scanning/copying/faxing after one year.  The second one has constant troubles with scanning.  Connected directly to my desktop with a short cable (not wireless), it routinely gets caught in a loop that will not resolve itself forcing me to both reboot my computer and the printer, by unplugging it since it won't shut down. I have numerous IT pros look at it and none can solve it. Technical help desks calls and been a waste of my time. The manufacturing quality of the boards that govern this process suck.  It's the last HP product I will ever buy.",

641,XX,B005O55U2Y,4,0,0,16-Feb-14,A3DD1XHT3CKU22,Great printer but missing important setup instructions !,"The printer is amazing and I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the missing setup instructions. It took me more than 4 hours to get this guy working over the wireless network (I have some patience). I hope the steps below will help other customers avoid the frustration I went through and set up the printer in just a few minutes:1. Complete the wireless wizard setup2. Change your printer IP to a static one (192.168.1.xx)3. Connect to your router and modify your LAN settings  - Manually Assign IP around the DHCP list (MAC of the printer matching the static IP address you assigned in step # 2)4. Open a browser and confirm you can connect to the printer at http://192.168.1.xx (a page with printer stats should open up)5. If step # 4 was successful, open control panel and go to Hardware and Sound > Devices and Printers6. Click the Add a printer link7. Select the Add a printer using a TCP/IP address or a hostname option8. Enter the required info (provide the IP address you had selected during the wireless wizard setup)9. Select the standard device type.10. Select HP for manufacturer and click the Windows Update button to get the latest drivers11. Select the OfficeJet Pro 8600 Class driver and click nextYou may need to make slight modifications to the steps above but I hope these instructions help you set the printer up over the wireless network. It's a great printer and I wish HP had taken the time to make better instructions. I still recommend this printer as long as you don't mind taking the extra effort of setting it up. Once done you will enjoy an otherwise great product.Pros: High quality, fast, stylishCons: Unless you assign a dedicated DHCP MAC and IP address, the printer will drop from the network as soon as it goes to sleep and you won' be able to print. A few router settings takes care of this problem.",
