Unfortunately I ended up buying this router after reading the reviews on Amazon.,0,0,0,0,0
Lots of people complained about its unreliability however few people mentioned that with the DD-WRT software the router would work fine.,0,0,0,0,0

Unfortunately the router started dropping connections all the time.,0,0,0,1,0
