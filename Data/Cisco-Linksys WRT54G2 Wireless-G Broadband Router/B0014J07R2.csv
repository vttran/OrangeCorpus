However, I have upgraded to a Netgear R6250, which is much faster and gives me a better connection. This was a great router though, but I would consider looking into at least n routers now, or ac if you have the cash.Pros: Lasts very long  Good RangeCons: Slow Performance  G Router  Expensive for what you getOverall this is a good router, but please, look into an n or ac router. You could get a better performing router for cheaper.",,,

6,XX,B0014J07R2,1,0,0,9-Jan-14,AB5MTM2ORRSI2,"Pretty awful. Linksys, you are dead to me.","The short version of my gripes:The most recent WRT54G2 (version 1.5) that I received was defective. It didn't have the decency to simply not work; it stuck me with an intermittent connection that had me wondering what other gremlins were lurking in our network for almost three additional business days. I've had two other WRT54G2s in the last four years, because the ones that did work only work for about two years. Not what I hope for in terms of quality.And now for the long version, since I need to vent:Perhaps I deserved this latest misery because I was being a bit lazy in the first place, but Linksys really cranked out crap with this model.I'm the techiest of the people in my office, so I get stuck with the network equipment. However, I'm not that much above a novice so I prefer to stick with simple things when possible. Four years ago, our office got a first gen WRT54G2, and it was configured by an outside tech person. Two years later, it craps out on us. I discovered we could still get the same model, so I bought another, because I'd noted all the configuration settings from the first one, and knew it would be quick to get the second one going. It was, but that one also lasted just over two years and got flaky last month. Seeing the writing on the wall, I started shopping again and found that I could get version 1.5 of this same model. I knew there were fancier routers out there, but I wasn't super confident I'd configure them correctly if they were a lot different from what I was used to, so I thought I'd take the easy way out and ordered this router for a third time.I configured it and put it into service early one evening, and when I left the office everything seemed to be working fine. Later that evening, I realized it had lost its little mind and there was no internet access at our office (from outside the office, as well as inside, as I found out the next morning). Restarting it did get it online again, but I had suspicions that I might have caused this error somehow so I reset it to factory defaults and configured it one more time.When I put it back into service, I found that we had internet access, but it was intermittent. Because the router was new, I thought surely it was the least likely culprit... so I talked to our ISP, who confirmed it wasn't their issue or the modem's (which made sense, since our connection to our file server was also intermittent), and then I did the second 'easiest' thing I could, which was to replace our switch. The old switch was unmanaged, so I couldn't tell if it was malfunctioning, but it was less expensive and faster to buy another than to call our expensive IT people. After putting in the new switch, I realized it had not been the problem.My next move was to call for server support, since all our traffic goes through it. Dell said our NIC could be failing, and offered to replace it but it would take another business day. Since I still wasn't 100% confident that this new Linksys router was 'good' I decided to pick up another router at Best Buy and try it out. I got a shiny new Netgear R6300 and it has more options and capabilities than our old Linksys (and faster wireless, too). Although the configuration options were numerous, I was still able to wade through the configuration and get it working. That is what fixed our connection, finally.I spent THREE working days on this network issue because 1) I'm not an expert, as I said, 2) configuring and swapping these things does take a little time even if you're good at it, in my defense, 3) I spent MANY hours on the phone with our outside IT people and Dell, and 4) do you know how long it takes to research your next move when your internet connection is constantly dropping out? This has been a really frustrating week, my coworkers have been quite angry about it all too, and I had many other things I wanted to spend my time doing. I hope to save someone else from a crappy Linksys product. If you are fortunate enough not to get a dud in the first place, be advised that this router dies about every two years anyway.And for the record, yes, I had updated to the current firmware as soon as I opened the box.",,,

I just went to BestBuy and bought this and eventually realize how terrible it was when I couldn't stream any videos from my apartment at all.

12,XX,B0014J07R2,1,0,0,3-Sep-11,A2X6ABC8M5JP4D,Constant slowdowns and disconnects,I've owned this router for a little over a year and it has given me nothing but grief. At first I thought it was the crappy ISP at my old apartment but after moving to a different place I still get all the same problems. The router frequently experiences slowdown where my connection slows down to a crawl and eventually stops altogether. The only solution I've found to fix this issue is to unplug the router for a couple of seconds and then plug it back in. That usually fixes it for a couple of hours until it starts acting up again.I guess you get what you pay for... Shame cause I used to really like Linksys. Now I'm off to buy a new router and I'm staying as far away from this brand as possible.,,,
13,XX,B0014J07R2,5,0,0,30-Aug-11,A14G3AZAND93VM,Very good and reliable product,"Many people have been writing all kinds of reviews about this Cisco modem on the Amazon,com site. I had read quite a few before I bought it nearly a year ago.  I needed a modem because I was switching to Time-Warner and this is one of three that they recommend to work with their broadband system, Since that time I have had no problems at all. It just works without forcing me to even be aware of it. That's what I call a good prodect!",,,

I told them I just purchased it and they said it goes my serial # and couldn't help me.  I thought a company like Cisco would extend the courtesy of how to at least assist for a few minitues of what I was doing wrong.  They made sure to take all my information and they better not use my name or address , email or phone for any reason.  I am so sorry I purchased this Router.",,,

I think i have 2 netgear routers and one switch, 2 linksys routers and 3 linksys switches, and 2 belkin routers. Out of all of this network gear, i like this router best for wireless. I got this for $1, can't really beat the price.",,,
16,XX,B0014J07R2,2,0,0,19-Jul-11,A13F9YN2DTH4D4,"If you get it for free, then its better than nothing","If you're going to pay for it then I'd keep searching.I am using this router because it's what is available at this place I'm subleasing. I have to cycle power on this thing at least once a day because it loses internet connectivity. It also loses connection with my laptop, 10 feet away with nothing in-between about 2-3 times a day. I'm grateful there is free fast internet for me to use but I wouldn't pay for this router. At home I have a WRT54G Linksys router I've been using nonstop since around 2003 that works wonderfully still. Amazon reviewers are generally generous so if you see a product that has as many bad reviews as good ones then its probably best to avoid unless there is a huge price opportunity and if you're a good sport about reseting routers everyday--its better than nothing at all!",,,

After a period of times (sometimes days, sometimes weeks), they will start dropping wireless connections.  The only solution is to reboot the router.

The directions come on a CD and has a limited support service program that helps you troubleshoot ny issues you might encounter.

It was constantly interfering with my wireless connection through Windows and it would never stay working. So I finally had to uninstall the router software and that resolved the issue. I wasn't able to delete my Windows wireless connection because I was using a USB wireless router for my desktop so had to delete the software. It works great for my PS3 as well. I recommend this product.",,,

Because there was no set-up program for a Mac with the product, I called the support people and was walked through a manual set-up that worked immediately, with no clitches (later I found out that the Linksys website has a set-up software package that can be downloaded to accomplish the same thing.Since then, the router has been performing very well. It provides the maximum amount of download and upload speed that our dsl modem and line will support. So I'm very happy.",,,

23,XX,B0014J07R2,3,2,4,29-Aug-08,AB95X9ZBK8HP9,Don't Buy for Macs,"I've not got the router set up and all seems to be working, I hope for a long time. So I'm not reporting a router issue, but an installation issue for Macs. The Linksys set-up disk, which apparently is supposed to make set-up a 5-minute process, doesn't work for Macs. But I didn't see that info on the Amazon product description, or on the Linksys support site. And it took 15 mins to get that little detail from the Linksys chat, which asked idiotic questions like 'where are you', a question that is just another nonsensical hurdle when you are trying to load a disk in a computer. The Chat person was totally unhelpful and a waste of time. Finally, I found an installation process on a Mac Forum. But what should have been -- as touted -- a 5-minute exercise took an hour and a half. Mac users, my suggestion is to find a router that promotes itself as Mac ready.",,,

It randomly looses it's ip connection to my cable modem and then takes forever to find it again. Based on the mixed feedback I see on this site I suspect it's a production defect that only affects certain routers as I see both very good and very bad ratings.  You're taking a risk buying this router.  I won't buy it again!,,,

What a pain that was. My wife is still trying to get the system to accept our other wireless computers.,,,
29,XX,B0014J07R2,5,2,2,29-Aug-08,A1SQS469WZ67JD,Buy this router!,Following the instructions and using the install CD I was able to set this up in a matter of minutes.

30,XX,B0014J07R2,5,0,0,28-Aug-08,AH5YR3QOY3MWZ,Looks good and performs well,This router is not just a pretty box. The signal strength is strong and reliable.The only trouble I had was getting it to work with my ancient Verizon DSL modem. In the end I had to chain this router to my old router. My guess is that this is an issue with the modem rather than the WRT54G2.Also impressive are the number of options on the router. Everything from advanced filtering to load balancing.Definitely good value for money.,,,
31,XX,B0014J07R2,1,0,1,28-Aug-08,A10LALVHCBCLRI,Failed within a month.,"This router was nothing but trouble.  The software it came with was spotty and I had to go through all sorts of headaches to reconnect to the network.  Finally removed it and had Windows Wireless Zero Config run the connection.  Then it prevented me from seeing my other work stations wirelessly, but allowed it wired.  The customer service agent had me change all these settings (via online chat) to reset the router and the whole system went down.  I tried to reset to factory settings and reinstall, but the software couldn't do it.  I finally junked it and bought a netgear router, which is working flawlessly.",,,
32,XX,B0014J07R2,5,0,0,28-Aug-08,A2VQUH4U7UJUWS,Amazing!,This little router is amazing! The set-up on my PC was difficult for me to do on my own because my IE's configuration was muddled. I called the 24-hour hotline and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of help I received. The tech stayed with me for over 45 minutes until the problem was solved. She was wonderfully helpful and I recommend this product not only for its quality but also for the customer service.,,,

The setup was easy and quick.",,,
35,XX,B0014J07R2,1,2,5,26-Aug-08,AOW82PYH5TNOP,"Broke quickly, and not so great when it worked","I bought this at WalMart.  It was fairly easy to install, but didn't ever work that well, with frequent times that it didn't seem to recognize my internet connection.  Many times, watching netflix on my laptop or something, it would just go out, and I'd have to reboot or reestablish the connection, etc.  After about 3 weeks of use, it pooped out altogether, and the internet light won't come on at all.  There's a warranty, but in order to get them to send me a new one, they require putting a hold on my credit card, which I think is annoying, and I'm not sure I really want another one anyway.  Maybe I just got a defective one, but it was a great disappointment.  I used to have one that came with my verizon service, and it NEVER failed to work, so after having completely consistent service, going to service you could never count on, and then none at all has been a TOTAL DRAG and a waste of time and money.",,,

All I did was pop the disk in and it took about 5 minutes to set-up.  Which was a pleasant surprise because I run a Mac G5.  Shortly after I got the G5 up and running my MacBook and Ipod Touch took even less time to set-up.  The reason I am giving this a 4 out of 5 is because I have not gotten my Wii running on it yet.  Note I have only spent about 5 minutes trying to get the Wii to work with it.  I have read that this router can be finicky with the Wii.  I would recomend this router to anyone who wants and easy WiFi solution.,,,
39,XX,B0014J07R2,5,6,6,20-Aug-08,A2K9CY6ZOVW5L,Great router once you get it set up,"I purchased this router to replace my WRT54G which died after 5 years of continuous use.  Considering the performance of my previous Linksys, going w/ their product again was a simple decision.  I stuck w/ wireless-G because  there is little to no feedback suggesting wireless-n technology increases performance.  Plus, I hoped I would have no trouble configuring my router sticking w/ a similar product.I have AT&T's express DSL service w/ up to 1.5 Mbps downstream.  I while my connection speed may not be blazing, I'm quite happy w/ the performance for my home use.  I notice no drop in speed using my Linksys wireless vs. direct ethernet connection.I was pleasantly surprised to find my signal range was slightly greater than my previous router.  I only say this as I tend to get better signal quality at my laptop.  I cannot offer any specs or 'scientific proof,' just my casual observation.I notice a lot of people complain about setup.  I spent around 2 1/2 hrs setting my network up, but it probably had more to do w/ my lack of computer savvy than the Linksys product.  Initially, I followed along w/ the included CD setting up the router using my laptop (Windows based).  My fatal error came when I decided to use WPA encryption - higher security, why not?  Well, the CD warns that older computers (hence my laptop) may not be compatible w/ WPA.  Had no problem connecting our iMac; the included instructions were easy to follow and worked beautifully.  When I went to connect my laptop, trouble ensued and I really made a mess of things BFG'ing my way through fixing it.  I finally configured for WEP encryption - the same I had w/ my previous router - and things are now copasetic.Bottom line, I am very pleased w/ Linksys wireless-g routers.  I probably would have had no setup problems if I had paid closer attention to the instructions.  Either way, I highly recommend this product.",,,

I am one floor up and a few rooms away and get 3-4 bars of connection which is good enough for broadband.3) There are LOTS of features you can play with. I am a techie, but I don't mess with the advance settings as many are above my head.4) The reason I bought this was to get an 'open NAT' for my Xbox 360.

If you leave a PC/device on for too much time, it will 'lose' it's IP address and there is no way around the issue other than rebooting / power cycling router and affected devices. It doesn't happen too often so it's not a major issue, but I would have appreciated the linksys forums to be more supportive of my post on this issue - as they really have not been.So 5 stars for product design, features and ease of use- 1 star for DHCP server flaw- 1 star for poor product support= 3 stars",,,

I've had a desktop computer for about 4 years now running on XP and it was my first computer - I'm almost 60 years old now. I decided to buy me a laptop with VISTA and learn the new operating system before the old one quits. No where did I see in the instructions that I had to hook up an ethernet cable to my laptop to setup and configure the router. I hooked it up to my desktop and configured it first. Did not work on Wi-Fi with my laptop.  Talked to Toshiba reps, Linksys reps etc. Spent hours on the phone going to different screens and typing in all kinds of IP's or whatever. I'm  a second grader when it comes to computers. From what I've read you don't even need to download the CD but please tell people to download it in their laptop and not their desktop. It dawned on me to do it that way this morning and it works just fine now and took about 5 minutes. From what I understand now the only WiFi computer that will work with my router is the one I have because of the security code. When I had first configured the router with my desktop my laptop was receiving an excellent signal from the router but could not connect because of the security key. Sorry about all the yapping in just a product rating forum. Still fun to learn with an older brain. First time laptop user with a touch pad, VISTA, and hooking up a router.",,,

It was clear that customer service had little training with Macs (and were incredibly negative about macs while speaking with them) and were rude.Now that the product is set-up it still doesn't work very well, and even in my very small cottage I can not find a place in the house (even right next to the router) that I get all of my signal bars.

To setup the router to his roomates pc in the living and to configure a Linksys WUSB54GC Compact Wireless-G USB Adapter to his pc and setup the 128 bit WEP encryption took all of 30 mins.

I cannot recall the last time a product spontaneously quit working on me.After more than 30 minutes, Linksys' customer service chat led me to an RMA process that was arduous at best.  Much of the time was spent scrolling through  pointless directions for uploading new firmware to a router where none of the ports were working.  At least I got an RMA.  For the effort, I might have been better off just paying for a new router and considering this a lost cause.Follow-up: decided to cancel the RMA rather than paying money to ship the old unit back to Linksys and waiting for a replacement to come out of backorder.Summary: poor product quality and poor customer service experience.",,,

Here I was, all prepared for a painful afternoon of geekese and error messages and unexplained no-connectivity, like the last time I had to do this...ordering out for pizza and a late night and probably some booze to ease the pain...and twenty minutes later, I'm on my laptop. (Fifteen minutes of that was fighting with the laptop.) You insert a CD, it walks you through four easy steps, generates the needed keys, and you're done. So now I have to stay sober and cook dinner, but it's a small price to pay. The wifi signal is strong, the router design is sleek and unobtrusive (a minimum of horrible sleep-disturbing blinking green lights, my personal pet peeve), the price was absolutely right.

As far as usage goes it has been very stable and I've only needed to power cycle it once but not for loss of connectivity but more for a slight loss of performance (I could not stream video from one computer to another without the video skipping and in general lagging. However in total fairness this could have been an issue with the computers themselves rather than the router.) As a gaming router I hooked up my Xbox 360 to it and it works great no NAT restriction problems (Keep in mind that if your ISP restricts your NAT then there is little you can do to help that with this router.) What I really like about this router is its design no goofy looking antennas. Other than that it is a pretty standard router that does not do anything particularly outstanding and you could take that as a good thing hence the 4 stars.Bottom line I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a decent 802.11g/b router however if you have the extra cash lying around maybe you should look in to buying an 802.11 n/g/b router if not just for the sake of being future proof.",,,

Did some research on routers that would work well with the Wii and came across this one.  I have to say, I'm very impressed.  The router took all of a minute or two to set up, and it connected instantly with the Wii after entering in my WPA password.  What's more, I have the router in the very spot that they tell you to avoid---in a corner in the basement on a middle shelf---and my laptop and Wii get excellent signals upstairs in the living room.  One thing to note:  The installation papers tell you that you may get an error during installation claiming that a connection to the internet isn't recognized, but to ignore it.  I think this is what confuses some people (especially those who don't read the inserts).  I got the error, clicked through it, and connected without a problem---and still do.

I think this product is by far best looking router out there. I can't believe how simple this product looks without antenna.One small issue that I faced was when I moved my notePC to other room (about 50 Feet away) and closed 2 doors, it had some interruption with less than stellar reception.

I am very tech savy, and I have found no other easy solution.Problem:It is a widely known issue that this router has DHCP issues, causing it to disconnect every few hours, making you get up, unplug it, and plug it in again (no remote reset on web GUI). Just google 'wrt54g2 disconnect' and you will see what I mean. Resetting appears to be the only thing that solves this strange problem (I'm tech savy, and I've tried fiddling around with just about everything). The only solution appears to be using 3rd party firmware (dd-wrt). However, this is too much trouble. I just want something that works.I guess the bright side is you get lots of exercise... but that's what gyms are for, not wireless routers.Other Details:Hoping to solve this issue, I upgraded the firmware. However, this just caused it to get worse (faster disconnect, no longer solvable by reset), making it completely unusable.

This router is promoted as an easy to intall router that will provide fast, reliable wireless connectivity blah blah blah...  As is the case with a lot of consumer electronics these days, there is a lot of overpromising and even more underdelivering.  Sure, it was easy to set the router up and, when it worked, it worked well.  But for no apparent reason, it just stops working on both the wireless end and with the ports connected to it.  I had a simple setup.  My desktop was plugged into port 1 & a laptop was using the wireless side.  This brick of a router would work OK for a while, but then just stop providing connectivity for both systems.  I tried reinstalling the firmware & running on different channels other than the default 6, same result.  I've reached my limit with fussing with this piece of crap & it has met its demise under the sole of my hiking shoe.  Yes, I know I have issues, but I am so tired of these pieces of junk promising this and that and not delivering.  I would not recommend this router to anyone unless they have the patience of a monk.  I was willing to try different things to get it to work, but wasting several hours on this product just to try to get it to work as advertised is absolutely ridiculous.",,,

Spent 3hrs on tech support talking to 2 indian ladies, the first of whom was very rude and talked to me as if I had an IQ of 50. After trying to convince me that my security settings were at fault, I eventually got on with the 2nd tech who determined that the hardware was defective. However they refused to honor the 1 year manufacturers warranty because they claimed it was expired, even though it had barely been 6 months since I purchased it. Apparently they start the warranty count down from when the retailer buys it, not the end user. If your retailer stocks cisco products for more than a few months, your warranty is worthless.",,,

I figure they must sell so many of these because they work, right?No more. Done. This was the last time I spend hours and even days trying to solve a problem that turned out to be a Linksys/Cisco router (this time the WRT54G2). If you're doing nothing more complicated than a couple of home computers behind a DSL or cable modem, maybe you'll be fine. But if you're doing anything business-related, save yourself the trouble.

I was going to go with the WRT54G and then saw that they had a new model, this one, WRT54G2. This one is great--I've never had to reboot or had any problems with it.  I also love how thin the router is and that it has no outside antennas.  Set-up was easy and took 5-10 minutes, it depends on the scans. Wireless connection was fast and works great.

I decided to try one more time (although I can't explain why, I really don't like pain).First I disconnected my existing router. Then, I opened the box and loaded the CD.

For the first 3-4 times I tried to run the setup CD, it didn't realize that I already was connected to a router and was replacing the old router with this unit.  That was frustrating.  When it finally realized that was the case, the installation, setup, and securing were easy.  It couldn't find my internet connection but once I unplugged and re-plugged the router and modem as the included FAQ sheet stated it worked great.  Plugged in the new password and I was on.  The signal appeared weak at the start but quickly updated to full strength.  Working great so far, great value for the $.  Happy to replace my old dying router with a new one.",,,

Installation was simple and problem free. Popped in the CD, followed a few simple steps on connections, create a name here, a password there and the wired connection to my desktop and the wireless connection to my laptop were all set in 5 minutes.Literally 5 minutes.And so far, the signal is very strong and problem free.It may not be the fanciest router out there, but for me, and I suspect many people, this seems a fine router.",,,

It is not specifically shown on the outside of the package, nor in the instructions, but it does work with a little help from the company.

There are about 4 steps, (not including naming your network and such.) This is a well-priced, general wireless router, and is just amazing! I used this to connect to my game systems also - (A Wii and Nintendo DS) And they connected perfectly! No worries at all. And, I get a perfect '3-bar' range everywhere in my house! The router is on the middle floor of my house, and I can get perfect connections in the basement, upstairs, wherever!I highly recommend this router to any first time users of a wireless network, and anyone else looking for a reliable wireless network.

142,XX,B0014J07R2,5,2,3,15-May-08,A2ZEG0WTPLOQXT,Solid router with great performance,"I purchased this router to replace my 3 year old Netgear WGR614v5.  The old router was fine, but when I upgrade to 15 Mbps service, it was bottlenecking the connection at ~3.5 Mbps.  A firmware update did not help, nor did tweaking my settings.  Enter the WRT54G2.  This thing was flying from the get-go.  It produces a strong Wifi signal and has all the features, controls and options that I want.  It flawlessly supports VPN that I use for telecommuting.  I haven't tried networking the Xbox 360 to it yet (which will be wireless), but I'm looking forward to seeing if it shows as an 'Open NAT'.  That was something the Netgear router needed some help on.  It eventually acheived 'open NAT' status, but required several setting change iterations to get it right.  On the ol' Netgear, settings changes required ~15 seconds of inactivity, while all of the network connections died (wired and wireless) and were re-estabilished, a bit of a pain.  The new Linksys router performs setting changes very quickly with no need for wireless devices to re-find the router afterword (unless you make wireless security changes, of course).  I also like the new router's package, compared to the old Linksys WRT54 (the big, blue brick).",,,

It updates the configuration almost immediately when you save the changes to configuration files.I contacted tech support via live chat, and they were extremely helpful and quick to the point.  I had videophone Sorenson VP200 which did not like this router.  I wish I could throw out this videophone and get it replaced with something else so I could keep this router.  However it is not my 'property', and I tried to get it to cooperate with the router, hence contacting tech support who were very helpful (took less than few minutes total).  However it appears to be simply firmware issue where the videophone simply decides what it likes or hate something.  Sadly, I had to return it.

I just looked in the manual for instructions on connecting to the admin interface for the router.I only had it hooked up for half a day.  The problem is - you cannot assign a static IP to a mac address.  I have a printer where this is necessary and from what I could tell the only way to do it is to download third party firmware.

150,XX,B0014J07R2,5,25,25,7-May-08,A37QUQPYFMR9Y9,I do believe this is my first 5 star review.,"OK.So I was initially looking at the Wireless-N version of this router, to potentially replace my old WRT54GS (Linksys Wireless G Router with SpeedBooster).  That router had problems, admittedly so.  It worked, but not as well as I'd liked given my setup.  Since all of my devices are either G or B wireless, I figured I would just settle for the G router and save money (this one is almost half the cost of the N router).For the record I've got a laptop (wireless), media server (wireless), PS3 (wireless), PSP (wireless), DS (wireless), EEE PC (wireless), PS2 (hardwire), 360 (hardwire), printer (hardwire), and DirecTV HR20 (hardwire).  Yeah, I know.  What's important: the media server is in the master bedroom's closet, far from the router, which is in the living room.  With my old router, signal strength got weak through walls, extremely weak.  Local network activity was painful, streaming movies from the media center was painful as it would frequently lock up and stutter; thumbnails would not load.Enter this router.  First thing to note: the CD is NOT required.  If you're new to wireless connections you may want to just follow the directions and CD, but if you're comfortable with navigating the router web interface, just bypass the CD and set it up like you normally would; it'll work.  Setup was quite painless and recognition was fast, I managed to replace my old wireless network in a matter of minutes.  There is also a feature that allows for a WiFi Protected Setup with a one-button press, but apparently the receivers require that feature to be built in as well - and none of mine did.  Therefore I just ignored it.  For those who are setting up for the first time and bought receivers with the feature included, they might find it useful when doing the setup.I immediately noticed an improvement in the local networking speed.  The aforementioned media server is now screaming fast over the network; thumbnails load just as fast as if I'm at the machine, file transfers are nowhere near as slow and streaming content plays with minimal lag.  Internet connectivity was also slightly improved on devices that were not close to the router.There are a couple of issues, not necessarily the router's fault, but more an issue with the way Linksys designs them.  First, getting internet connectivity took way too long and was not as easy as it should have been.  I had to powercycle my modem to get it to pull the IP information - even though the details should have easily been accessible from the previous router having gotten them.  This might be a Time Warner issue rather than a Linksys issue - maybe it sees a different MAC and freaks, but I doubt it.  Once I got the IP information, the router still would not give internet connectivity for a minute.  I'm using Vista Premium so I can tell when it's 'Local', 'Internet' or both and it struggled to get both up.Second, and a minor nitpick at best, the power cord is easily half the size of the WRT54GS.  For the life of me I can't understand this.  It makes it hard for me to locate the router in a good place, because I like to have the router on the UPS, and by shortening the cord I have to have the router in the middle of the floor.  Minor issue, but still a problem for me.Otherwise, I highly recommend this.  It seems they fixed the majority of the problems the previous devices had.  I noted that the negative reviews came from people who had support problems; I never call the Bombay support line, so I have nothing bad to say.",,,
151,XX,B0014J07R2,1,6,47,6-May-08,AWUQXRTHN4FT9,A very difficult company to deal with,"This is a bad company.  I purchased a wireless router from them and, truth be told, it never really worked right.  The speed was ok, but it was impossible to set up without tech support and every so often it would simply stop working.  When that happened I would be forced to call tech support and spend 30-60 minutes on the phone fighting with them about resetting the router.  I recently purchased a new computer and decided to save a little money by moving this router to it.  When I called tech support I was told that the router was out of its warranty period and they could not help me... unless I would pay them to.  That's right, I would have to pay for the assistance on their product - a working product because it was not under warranty.So be warned that you are only buying the option to use Linksys' products for a limited time - that is if you have any problems whatsoever that require tech support.

I did a lot of research and decided to settle with this particular router.  I was unsure at first due to its internal antenna design.  I brought it at a store, took at home, and after opening the box, I was online wired and wirelessly in about five minutes with my Dell running XP Pro, and my iPhone.  The enclosed CD for the visual walk through was beautiful.  Not once did I need to worry, think, or do anything 'technical'.  There was no reboot, power on or power off of anything.  I just plug in the cables and power cord as instructed by each step in the CD.  It was totally painless.  I couldn't believe it that I was done in 5 minutes.I tested the wire speed with my pc and it was fine at the normal DSL speed.  However, the iPhone only picks up about 3/4 to 5/6 of the normal DSL speed wirelessly; but that is still good enough for me.  Since this is just day 1 of using this router, I have yet to test distance, wireless speed consistency and stability, other wireless pc, and notebook.",,,

I was so pleased to find this one that just looks like an alarm clock sitting on the table. Not only that, it works really great too. I encounted one little glitch while running the setup. Somewhere during the process I was told that my internet connection could not be detected, but I opted to proceed with the setup anyway, and when the setup was done, I could not access the internet. I contacted Live Help via chat (very cool) and was offered advice. It turned out that all I had to do was run the setup again to solve the problem, since then it's been working like a charm, no problem whatsoever.",,,

Just as I finally decided to bite the bullet to buy one of the other Linksys G routers they released this model.  I liked the fact that it is sleek and there are no external antennae that you have to consider in trying to locate a space for the router.  There weren't too many reviews for it because it was that new, but the reviews I did find were all favorable.  Amazon got it to me quicker than they said they would and it was very easy to set up.  The only problem I had was self-inflicted when I tried playing around with some of the settings, but the tech service was very cooperative and bailed me out.  It's been smooth sailing ever since.

I understand that my old DSL modem or AT@T is at some fault (incompatibilities with Linksys).  But why Linksys doesn't fix it.

It took about 5 minutes total to set up the router and have a wireless connection to my desktop. I have an excellent reception to my desktop that sits about 30 feet away in another room. Also, I have my desktop and laptop (both running vista), xbox 360, and ps3 connected to it wirelessly. the xbox 360 NAT is open and the ps3 NAT is type 2. I'm not sure what that stuff means technically, but in normal person terms it means that I can connect to others with no problems. The back of the router has 4 10/100 ethernet connections on it as well if you want a wired connection.The design of this router is really excellent. The antennas are built into the router and the dimensions of it are really small and thin! This gives you more flexibility of where the router can be placed.Streaming recorded TV, music, and pictures from my desktop to xbox (using media center) work well for both being connected wireless with no reduction in picture quality.With the release of the new Xbox 360 dashboard I am able to stream HD video from Netflix wirelessly through my 360 with this router. The wait time for video to start is short and the picture quality of HD shows like Heroes and 30 Rock is great.*Update* I have had the 20' 2.66ghz iMac since May 08 and connecting it to my linksys was as simple as selecting the network and typing in my password. The router has been up and running several months now with no resets or connection issues. This is a very stable router that requires little to no maintenance. Now my connections to this router are a laptop with Vista every now and then, Mac with OS X 10.5, ps3, 360, and 2 iPhones. There are no problems when 2 or more devices are using the connection. I am connected to a 6mbps cable connection.Recently I got the new unibody MacBook and an eyeTV hybrid 2009 model. I use it to record TV (mainly the HD shows sent via QAM from comcast) on my iMac. I want to stream a HD show like The Office from my iMac to my macbook that is connected my my 46' samsung (lnt-4665), but I have found that 'g' is not fast enough to stream a show recorded in HD. It is fast enough to stream a show recorded in SD, so I need an 'N' router if I want to stream wirelessly.",,,

They both suffer from a random ip drop and it fails to reconnect without 3-4 hard restarts.Apparently this model has known firmware issues that have never been fixed. Luckily it can be fixed by using dd-wrt, which is a open source firmware for routers. After switching the routers over to it (which voids the warranty btw) they work flawlessly. Sadly I can not support a piece of hardware the requires you to use open source firmware to even function reliably.Unless you have the knowledge to update the firmware, and the desire to do it, stay away from this router!

The box arrived quickly and in good shape, but right after it came I received a wireless router from a friend for free.  When I emailed to ask about the return policy, I received a curt reply stating that IF the router was still sealed in its original packaging, I could send it back for a refund.  I had to email again for an address to send it to, and the reply came a couple days later with no instructions besides the address.We ended up trying out the refurbished router anyway because our free router was on the fritz.  There were no scuffs or anything and the router looked great, plus it came with an installation CDRom.  Now, I am no tech expert whatsoever, but after using the installation CDRom, we seemed to need a code or registry certificate that was nowhere to been seen on the product, within the contents of the CDRom, or on the one piece of paper that came with the box (which was basically just info on Linksys' limited warranty and tech support number).

He couldn't get it working correctly. Somehow, I was 'accidentally' disconnected. I called back and spoke with another person (she sounded French). In about fifteen minutes, she had me back up.The next day when I was ready to log in, same problem: my laptop showing No Internet Access. I could get it to work sometimes by unplugging modem and router then replugging. When I did call again, I reached another guy who really wanted to help (from India). We were on the phone for about 30 minutes. He had me doing the same thing as the first guy (the things that didn't work). At one point he told me to call the phone company again and get them to put my modem to full-bridge mode. I refused because I felt there was something wrong with the router and he was really going to mess everything up. He told me if I do this one thing and it didn't work, they would send a replacement router. He felt the router was defective, but wanted me to call the phone company to make them match something (possibly) with the router instead of the router working with the modem.Long story short: I bought another router, it's working perfectly now. Had to send the defective modem back. I'm thankful to Amazon.com for having a policy that doesn't saddle you with a defective product.

196,XX,B0014J07R2,5,0,0,13-Feb-11,A3OGHIEH9BVPS7,All around pretty good router,"Picked up this wireless router after doing a fair bit of research, and I've come away happy. I won't lie, there's definitely a lot of features I don't really use, such as wireless printing, and I'm pretty sure it lets you share files and applications between multiple pc's, but for what I use it for, it's worked great.Very easy to setup, and easy to use, and it can handle a lot of different functions if you're going to be using it in an office setup or something. I mainly used it for online gaming, wireless connection for internet tv, and wifi for a laptop and it performed excellently for all those functions. It has strong security if you use all the tools it has, it's very reliable, and transmits a strong wireless signal. I even tested it's signal strength outside with the laptop once just to mess around, and I would have been trekking in the woods before I lost the signal (I do live somewhat in the country, so don't get too excited lol). It's size and shape also seemed pretty convenient, it can fit just about anywhere, and overheating is not an issue. 5 stars.Note: I wouldn't recommend using the reset button on the back to cycle the power, if you do this it resets the factory defaults for your router settings, so if you like customizing its features you'll have to do it all over again. If it does lose signal or network address, just unplug the power and plug it back in after cycling modem power.",,,

Cisco customer service picked up the phone on the first ring and gave me a live person immediately.  I did not have to answer thousands of questions and they went right to trying to solve my problem.  They were friendly and professional (albeit in some far eastern country).  However, they were never able to solve my problem.  We tried PPoE, setting a bridge, changing the DNS, etc.  You name it; we tried it.  I called three different times.  I have no problems with Cisco customer service, but they ultimately could not make the router work.  (The DLS works fine without the router).

211,XX,B0014J07R2,1,0,1,28-Jan-11,A3H8R9RBN7MYD,Quite Possibly the WORST ROUTER I have EVER Used,"This has to be one of the worst routers on the market.  From my knowledge, Cisco has changed the version of this model but has sold it under this same page.  This router is total garbage.  I need to reset it at least three times a day or else I cannot connect to it and that is definitely not normal because other routers I have used had no such problem.  The Network Magic which comes with it is NOT a full version so a great deal of the features are not available without purchasing a license.  The feature that is available is looking at your network and seeing which devices are connected to it, and by far the most useful feature is the little window which pops up in the corner telling you that your computer is either 'connected' or 'not connected'... big help. (just a HINT of sarcasm in that)I would definitely not buy this router again, nor recommend this to anyone I know.",,,
212,XX,B0014J07R2,3,0,1,28-Jan-11,A1YSSOWVYOCOP2,Works great if you don't need security,"Used it two ways:  (1) for 4 months I've been using it to share a printer and external hard drive on the basement PC with laptops upstairs, and it's worked great -- faster xfer than going thru the wireless card on the basement computer; (2) just changed over to cable internet and now using the router for that, and it's also working great -- I'm able to connect to the internet with the PC, either laptop, and also with my iTouch.  The only complaint is with Network Magic, which, unless you have little or no PC knowledge, seems to complicate matters and slow things down (so I uninstalled it).  Also, for families, I recommend using OpenDNS with this router (OpenDNS.com), to centralize your control over what the kids can access in the house (plus it's free).Update Feb. 2011:  Cannot get it to reliably lock out time frames using Access Restriction policies.  Very flakey, and if you change one policy it seems to override others.  I'm using several 'deny' policies to lock out different times at night (one to force the kids to quit using the internet so they get to bed, and one later on to force the adults to quit using the internet so THEY get to bed). ;-)However, it appears there are major flaws with the firmware in this respect (and I have updated it with the latest version).  Besides thinking that 12am in the morning is 'later' than 5am in the morning (a problem which did eventually correct itself -- somehow), it simply won't enforce restrictions reliably.  I'm writing this right now during my 7pm to 8:30pm 'denial' policy -- so it's obviously not working.If we reset the router, the restrictions will work for a little while, and then stop again.  And any modification you make on the fly seem to cause it to screw up all the policies.So ... if you don't need to set Access Restrictions -- i.e. you'll just leave it on all the time -- it seems to work pretty good (I'd give it 4 stars for that).  And it worked great when we just used it to network a printer early on.  But for Access Restrictions it's horrible.",,,

I very much agree with another reviewer that you should take the time to geek out and use the dd-wrt firmware (and update it) on this because it simply works better and is more configurable.  You can even adjust the power output of the router (the default is too high; for ashtray style routers from linksys drop it down to 35-50 to reduce noise and extend router life).  There was another minor tweak for the number of maximum IP ports that you may have to change slightly if you use P2P software but I set mine at 1024 max ports with an 1800 TCP timeout (120 udp).  I VPN for work and works fine with multiple devices running wireless G.  If you're a little bit of a nerd it's pretty easy to put the new firmware on there; this is a really good cheap router you can make better quite easily saving you $.  Even through a couple walls and a decent distance away I get an avg full bar 48mbps and run an avg 1.5MB/sec download which is using enough of my connection with other clients in mind and suits me fine.

256,XX,B0014J07R2,4,0,2,27-Dec-10,A3J7UR2RSK8S4A,Decent if you don't plan on using custom firmware,"What can I say? The router itself works fairly well out of the box, taking into account you change the DHCP lease duration to the max. I wouldn't have any problems with this thing if I didn't find myself in a situation where I had to limit bandwidth usage of other computers on the network.Since there really isn't any easy way to block torrent programs for individual users, I would have liked the stock firmware to at least allow me to limit available bandwidth for specific users, or allow me to flash the router with custom firmware. As the router I received is version 1.5, I can't put custom firmware on it, because not only does the router no longer use a Broadcom chipset, it also only has 2MB of flash memory, which just isn't enough.I just ended up buying a WRT54GL router, and while it is a little more expensive, it is definitely worth it. This one should still work fine if all you want is a cheap router that gets your devices online wireless with little hassle... and hey, you might just get lucky and find yourself with an earlier version that CAN be flashed, but I dunno.",,,

Our old one kept dropping internet access, in addition to the computers moving at a snail's pace. With the new router, we've realized that our internet access has not been the problem.Installation is easy, with step by step directions. Being technically challenged, I was worried about hooking up one mac-mini, a mac pro and two PC's. It took me less than an hour to do all 4. In addition, the iPhone and iPod touch were just as easy. Security is automatic, as opposed to a challenge to implement on my old router.This is a no brainer for our family. The ease, the cost, the speed. Wow!",,,

We don't use wireless printing, so I can only speak to the fact that the wireless internet works wonderfully well. I don't have to get up 10 times a day to restart the router. If the internet slows or won't load, I will sometimes have to turn the airport on and off on my mac, but that's minimal imposition in my view. The set up on this required consulting both mac and linksys online help manuals, and I finally got it to work after trying a few things (ie, it didn't simply take the few steps listed in the instructions that came with the router), so that wasn't ideal, but now that it's set up, I love it.",,,

The instructions weren't even correct, however, eventually, I figured out where the instructions went wrong.  The product worked for four days and then died.  I contacted Customer Service and got a representative in the Phillipines who was graet.  However even with his help it took well over an hour to reinstall.  The router died again five days later.  This time my call to Customer Service took me to India.  The customer service rep was terrible. The first problem was I was having difficulty understanding him. Then, after 40 minutes of trying to reinstall my router, he gave up and disconned me.  He also disconnected his remote access to my laptop so this was not an accident.  He didn't call back either as my first rep from the Phillipines said he would do if we got disconnected.  I called back again and was on hold for 30 minutes before I finally hung up.

I was a little concerned that without external antennas I wouldn't get coverage vertically across three floors of my home as I did before but coverage is as good or better, as is speed. So, I start out with five stars for performance.Using it with a Verizon DSL Westell 6100G modem, it seems an excessive number of power on/offs were required on both the WRT54G2 and the modem before they would exchange data, but it is solid now. Cisco should spend another 20 cents and put an on/off switch on its consumer routers as it does its business ones -- this pulling the power adapter plug in and out is for the birds. The setup software was not helpful with this issue and it ended up being a manual process. One star deduction for this nuisance.The other setup fiasco was trying to access the Advanced Configuration to change the channel, which you normally do by typing 192.168.1.1 into your browser (per the instructions) getting the router's setup page. I tried and tried, but could not connect. Finally contacted Cisco tech support through the online chat (which worked well) and determined that, for some reason, my router had been setup with a different address: 192.168.0.1. Trying that address worked. Keep this in mind if you have the same problem. Another one star deduction for lack of quality control.",,,

(EDITED)","I'm pretty good at putting computer components together (I built the one I'm using from scratch), but I always put wireless networking on another level. I bought a laptop on Black Friday and needed to buy a router, and this one got great reviews so it's the one I chose.Thankfully, setup was quite easy. The installation CD walks you through the process, from the actual physical connections (moving two plugs around and powering up the actual router) to the user names and passwords you need (which are saved into a text file in case you forget). At the end, it installs a program called 'Network Magic' which you can use to see which devices are connected to the network, what the status of your connections are, etc (of course, you have to PAY EXTRA for features like the speed test). I accidentally typed in the wrong password to my DSL account and couldn't get the internet to work, but the included booklet has an address you can type into your internet browser which allows you to edit your settings manually, and after using that I was up and running fine.The speeds on the PC and laptop are as fast as before, and I'm thinking about setting up a PSN account (mainly for Netflix streaming of old tv shows). I'm guessing the 'N' version of the router is faster somehow, but it's also twice as expensive. As long as things stay at this speed, I'm satisfied.EDIT:-PS3 online play is excellent. Netflix streaming was decent when it worked, but I would get the buffering message a lot on certain titles.-I often have that problem where I have to manually reboot the router (unplug and replug). Sometimes I have to do it multiple times in a day, other times it goes a month or more without any problems. Ah, technology...",,,

I called and the tech walked me through the wiring and then asked me to press reset and THEN asked for my serial number.

Absolutely no help from the community forum.  I still haven't connected the second laptop to the printer.  Again, no help from the forum.  Still waiting on a reply from Linksys.  Documentation for printer set-up is poor at best.  One shouldn't need a PhD from MIT to connect a laptop to a network printer.  Why is documentation written for people who already know how to do this stuff?  So much is taken for granted.",,,

299,XX,B0014J07R2,3,0,0,5-Nov-10,AEQKGFC1SQL2O,Poor router with compatability problems,"First and foremost, I consider myself above average when it comes to technology. I'm by no means an expert but I have enough knowledge to fix the little problems that other people would pay to have fixed. I bought this router two years ago at Bestbuy in order to share Comcast cable internet. Never had any issues up until I switched to ATT&T DSL (cheaper). Mind you that there is nothing wrong with my DSL connection as it works fine when connected directly from the modem. However, this router has a terrible compatability problem with this particular modem. It was a pain having to reconfigure the routers default IP address because of conflicting issues. When I finally got the router to work properly, it would not last very long. It would drop the signal on a daily basis. And this normally happens in the mornings when it is trying to obtain/renew an IP address. Believe me when I say I've tried from cloning the MAC address to even setting up a STATIC IP address. It would not fix the signal dropping issues. So after several months of this annoying issue, I decided to look for another router. So far I have not had any problems with my new NetGear Rangemax Wireless-N 150; easy to install and NO DROPPED SIGNALS!!!Pro: Works good when signal wasn't droppedCons: Not Vista OS friendly. Conflicting IP address issue with modem and router. Daily dropped signals.",,,

Of course, they left the insecure default password on the router during the call.Later put password in Vista machine and would not work.

312,XX,B0014J07R2,2,0,0,19-Oct-10,A3OWZLEKNLDP8X,Not for 5 computers.,"I have used Linksys before and have been relatively happy until purchasing this Wireless-G Broadband Router. It was very easy to set up and install. It comes with a CD that walks the customer through installation and network set-up. It worked quite alright when I had only one computer wired to it, although a speed test showed that my connection was slightly slower than it should have been. After two days of slow internet and constant disconnections I decided to take it down and put up an old router. This case may not be the same for everyone. My roommates and I use the internet and our home network all day long with our 5 computers (4 of which are connected via WiFi). I would not be able to recommend this modem to anyone because I have had no positive experiences with it. I will say that if you make extensive use of your home router, this is probably not a good option.",,,
313,XX,B0014J07R2,1,2,2,18-Oct-10,AET9XC1ZH7ZS2,"Unreliable, multiple issues, bad support","I am an advanced computer tech with my own onsite service business. I first purchased this product Jan.'09. Within a few months I began having speed/dropped connection issues. I finally got fed up with it and opened a tech support chat session. After multiple sessions, during which the procedure caused the connection to be completely lost, they agreed to replace the unit. The replacement worked fine for a few months. Then I tried setting the Access Restrictions and they would only stay set for 1 day. Again, after multiple tech support chat sessions and upgrading the firmware, the problem was not resolved. The final time I contacted tech support, they said they could no longer provide support as the unit was now out of warranty. After several calls and almost 2 hrs. and multiple elevations, they agreed to send a 1 time replacement of a refurbished device with no more tech support. I thought that when linksys was bought by Cisco that service would improve. Not so! DON'T BUY LINKSYS/CISCO HOME PRODUCTS!!!!! Spend a few extra bucks and get better quality of both equipment and service.",,,
314,XX,B0014J07R2,4,1,1,15-Oct-10,AJ5EDBDFT5WD3,Very Nice Router,"This router is looks great and works pretty well too. I bought this product when my old router fell out of date and no longer functioned with my computer. So far I have had no problems. The set up was easy and the software walked me through it very quickly. I use the router for my computer and gaming console and so far the connection works fine with no consistent lag. This router also looks very slick with a stream lined look and feel to it. However, I will say that Link-Sys customer support is pretty bad. They helped me before my old-router died on me and everything went pretty well. After my old rig became out of date though, they told me that my free technical support time had ended and asked me to pay 30 dollars for a one year extension on it. That's only slightly less than I payed for the new router. Everything else is great though and I would recommend this router to anyone who needs one. Just keep in mind that eventually Link-Sys won't help you with your problems.",,,

Here is my take on what happened.  After a day or so, its services like web interface and DHCP server would crash.  Once DHCP session expires, you can't renew it and you can't login to manage the router.  The only thing you can do at this point is reboot it.  I checked for updates, but there was no hint that this problem was ever fixed.  There was a limit on how much time I was willing to troubleshoot it, so I returned it.",,,

Linksys support asks me stupid questions as if I was dumb.  Finally agreed to replace it for me, but I had to pay to send the defective unit to them, and give a credit hold on the 'REFURBISHED' one they sent me..  So I ended up paying for a new item from Amazon, then payed to ship it back to linksys, only to receive a working/used refurbished one.  Quite disappointed, be careful buying these online when you can buy one locally and take it back if it doesn't work.***Update Nov 28, 2012***Guess these are selling for 2 bucks on ebay lately, would be silly to buy them new on here for $50! Its no wonder why they are so cheap, product was garbage to begin with.

I called the Linksys office to fix my router but I was asked to pay $39.99 for the trouble shooting or buy a new router. I thought that was ridiculous. Why fix something that is not broken?  There is nothing wrong with my router, they need to just configure it from there computer or wherever, but the guy wanted me to buy a new one. I was very upset because if i bought a new router now, when next AT&T decides to upgrade my modem, would they make me buy another router or pay $39.99 whenever there product isn't working? I truly think it is ridiculous.",,,

We do not know what the problem is but think this is from a bad service from the wireless company. All of us haven't tried to think this is a problem from the new router which I purchased just in this September!! The causation was found one day after we have a two-day weekend without internet, one of my roommates found that she can have internet when she directly connect her laptop with the modem using a cable. So it must be a problem with the router. Every indicator light on the router looks good, so the router seems good, but actually it is not!! It's no use if you press the refresh button on the upper face of the router. The only way for you to regain the wireless is to unplug and plug in the power plug of the router or find a tiny rod to press the reset button in the back side of the router!

Each time the signal needs to pass through a wall or a floor the strength is weakened, so you will need to do some trial and error of the positioning of this router so that in the long run you will you receive an adequate signal in your favorite surfing locations.This router is very competitively priced and should prove to be a wise investment.",,,

As a technology salesperson I can wax rhapsodic on software and hardware at work but, when home, all I really want is a simple to use, cheap device that everyone else in the house and reset when the power goes out. The Cisco-Linksys  WRT54G2 is just that; a cheap and easy to use device suitable for the average home. The wireless throw is very good (at least 250ft.) and the device is a breeze to install. Even better, it's simple for non-tech folks to use and reset when the power goes out.

I keep it hooked up by direct ethernet to my Xbox360 to make sure I always get the best connection to the Xbox and then I have a wireless printer, a macbook, and a sony labtop all sharing the internet connection.  The connection is strong enough to give me full signal strength throughout my house (single story 3bd home) and about half signal strength in the backyard.  The setup is very simple, I lost my setup cd at some point and had to reset my connection and found by googling the model I was able to get directions without the installation cd that were also pretty simple.  It's hard to gauge how much internet content it can handle since my broadband internet is likely the most limiting part of my setup but to give an idea, I have no problem running internet radio, streaming music, and playing xboxlive games all at the same time.  It looks nice in the tv stand next to my flat screen, doesn't make any noise or have any other issues.  If it gets unplugged, it still keeps your saved network settings when plugged back in.",,,

I paid for 2 day delivery and the router arrived at my door in about 18 hours.Set up was pretty easy,  but I have to comment that the included software is NOT required. I don't know why these companies mark these routers and other similar devices, making it seem as if special software is required. It's a network device, you plug it into your network and you have a network connection.  Yet they even insist on putting tape over the network plugs with a label on that that says 'INSTALL THE CD FIRST'  I am STRONGLY against installing unnecessary software on my computer, and the included software is definitely unnecessary. I'm typing up my review on my network connection going through this router right now and I did not even open the CD.  My wireless PS3 works like a charm too.I've read a few of the reviews that people said the device is unreliable, I only just installed it so I will update this if things change, but for now, installation was a breeze, although I am somewhat familiar already with linksys products so I was familiar with their configuration menus.",,,
344,XX,B0014J07R2,1,0,0,12-Sep-10,AC3BO1MCQL35N,Review for Cisco Wireless G router,"I bought this router onnline through Amazon.com. After installing it, I ran into problems with my wireless printer, so had to pay a guy to come out and re-set the printer to work with the router. I had an older Linksys router upstairs previously and used my laptop downstairs in my kitchen (the router itself was upstairs in my office). I never had problems with other routers (bad signal, interference, etc) but with THIS one- I have to re-set it almost every day and it is a royal pain in the butt. I had it 'boosted' by the computer guru and it still happens. It doesn't happen when using my laptop upstairs in my bedroom- but I can't get a good signal consistently on a separate level (downstairs) with this particular router. I thought maybe this was just a bad router, so the first time I sent it back and had Amazon re-end me another one (the ease of return and customer service with Amazon were both EXCELLENT)- but after doing all of the same stuff to install the second router (what a headache), we still have the same problem. I am going out to buy one that has better reception or a stronger signal. If you are not RIGHT NEXT TO the computer (ie, on the same level of the house)- buy another model!!! And next time, vent hough the return was easy wit the self-printing label, it is easier to go to a big ox store and just get one immediately.",,,

After that, it would require a power cycle every fifteen minutes or so (wired and wireless quit working). I read on the forums that you have to do a complete 'reset' on the unit after upgrading the firmware (don't know why Linksys didn't tell me about that when I downloaded the firmware). After that, the router would intermitently just quit working about once a day. I replaced it yesterday with a newer (80211.n) model, hope it works out better than this one did.",,,

You just pop in the CD and follow the easy instructions. You can either use a generated key or make one up yourself. I think it took me about 5 minutes to do it all. I have an older one at my house that took 30 mins or more to figure out. That was a few years ago. Cisco has really done an excellent job in automating all those manual steps that were needed in the past. This is the way a router setup should be.

IF YOU DO, GET AN EXTENDED WARRANTY IF POSSIBLE, AS YOU WILL NEED IT!!!When installing this router I did not choose parental controls, however it automatically installed them! Normally that wouldn't have been a problem but it kept me out of my online banking, wouldn't allow me access to Outback Steakhouse coupons etc! I tried to get rid of the controls, but it did not recognize my email or password as I never entered them because I never installed them. A call to customer service got me to a Middle Eastern Tech that was difficult to understand and did nothing to help me...all he had me do was reset my router, told me it was fixed, and it was not. I emailed for help and never got a response. I told another tech I was going to return it for a refund and get another brand and was laughed at because 'It had been too long for a refund' (its been a month!)I even tried to remove the software so I could try and set it up again but guess what? They hide the software under a different name. (no Linksys,Cisco,Trend Micro) I was finally able to locate it only because it was the only thing I installed that day. Doing a google search verified WebEx Communications was owned by CISCO!I even enlisted my sister-in-law to help me. Working as tech support for an internet company, she tried to fix it herself with no luck. Finally I called Linksys tech support again and 3 hours later and a few frustrated choice words for the tech my sister-in-law was able to remove the controls for me.Finally my router is working correctly and now I can actually surf the net. This was a nightmare and didn't need to be. Everyone I talked to recommended this brand but nobody ever heard of this problem, and Now I find out ther are numerous people all over the country having this same problem it is not just me! I thought after the free 30 day trial of the security it would go away...it didn't.At one point the tech was trying to get my sister-in-law to a certain page, and it wasn't working. While he had her on hold,(to check his other resources) she was able to get to the correct page a different way and when the tech came back he asked her how she did it!!! He had no idea how to do it.The thing is I am happy with the router now that it is working properly, but I am very upset that this company took over two computers and put parental controls on when we didn't want them!!! We are in our fifties and don't need an internet babysitter!!! We don't have kids living here or using our computer.The sneakiness, unhelpful tech support, and unresponsive online customer service has caused an extremely unhappy customer!!!Word of mouth is your best or worst advertisement...this is the worst!!!I would have recommended on the basis of the router but given all the other facts I would never again recommend or buy their product!!!",,,

It works perfectly fine for browsing the web and watching YouTube and everything and will work with Xbox 360 and PS3 as well. The only thing it doesn't really work for is doing something like streaming Netflix and doing other stuff at the same time. It will do one or the other just fine, but as with any wireless G router, if you're trying to have too many users accessing the internet at the same time while streaming video it can get kind of slowed down.  For a Wireless G router though, this one is fast and reliable and has never given me any issues. I recommend Linksys to anyone.

This router was a little better, but had a tendency to drop my ssh connections. When I later got a second router (netgear; very nice with tomato firmware), I flashed this one with dd-wrt. What an improvement! This router works much better on dd-wrt than with the default firmware.Now, years later, this router simply does not stand up to the much better products available at lower prices, such as the offerings of tp-link and netgear. Do not buy this router new; you would be wasting your money. If you get it used, make sure it is hardware revision 1.0, so that you can install dd-wrt on it.In the interest of disclosure, here are the stats for a revision one model:CPU Model: Broadcom BCM5354 chip rev 2CPU Clock: 240 MHz  NVRAM: 32 KB  RAM: 16 MBAs you can see, the stats on this thing are pretty lackluster for the price compared with other routers available these days.This router is the first to have Linksys's VXWorks firmware installed. For you, the end user, this means that installind dd-wrt is a bit harder. You have to use a special, modified tftp client to upload a binary rom specifically to remove VXWorks, and then you can upload a dd-wrt binary rom. Here is a page detailing how to do it:[...]If you are using linux, here's a page you might find more useful:[...]Currently, this router is still chugging along; I'm using it as a wireless repeater to boost the signal for my community free wireless internet, and it's working pretty well; it connects at about -60 dbm and I get full bars for the repeated signal. If what I have said so far sound complicated and confusing, you definitely should not get this router. If what I said does not sound too complicated, you probably still shouldn't get this router, unless you got it on sale for $5 to $10, or you already have it, and it's revision 1.0.Thanks for reading; hope this helped.",,,

The router only froze two or three times in these two plus years, and a quick restart of the router fixed the issue.Installation and set-up were relatively easy for me, but if you are not as technologically savvy it can be confusing.

I spoke to was very hard to understand which made the conversation very difficult. It seemed like she was merely reading from a script and didn't actually know what she was doing. After a while, it seemed like she had given up trying to help and told me that my router was not supposed to work with broadband speeds or something and that I should upgrade to model number XYZ for X amount because it works for higher speeds. I told her that not only had the router worked perfectly fine before, but that I was not going to pay for a new router just because she couldn't figure out how to fix it. Eventually after giving me the runaround and being generally not helpful, I asked to speak with a supervisor. She told me that her supervisor was speaking to other customers, and I told her I'd be happy to wait on hold. Instead of agreeing, she once again suggested I just buy the newer router.

380,XX,B0014J07R2,2,4,5,24-Jul-10,A2INGDHZFPDBFP,"Taking Pot Luck with Refurbs, New Ones Can Have Issues as Well","I probably buy about 20 wireless routers a year either for new customer installations or as replacements for older units.  Recently Linksys has started selling refurbished units at deeply discounted prices.  Of the last 10 I have purchased either through Amazon or my Cisco distributor, 7 have been pretty much DOA.  Most just quit working, one even had a broken connector on the WAN port.  I just don't understand how they maintain any quality control and how they can even consider sending out refurbished units.  It isn't just one model, but it goes through the entire offering of refurbished units.  This has happened with all of the WRT line.  I haven't purchased any of the E series or Valet, so I can't express any opinion on those.The new units are not much better.  Many features are lacking without flashing the ROM to something like dd-wrt; wireless connectivity can be spotty; and sync with DSL or broadband is inconsistent.  I spend a lot of time troubleshooting these units.  A few years ago, I had no issues with the older versions like the WRT54G with the external antennas.  The newer versions just do not have the reliability I have come to expect.Customer service has also become an issue.  Even previously, support was spotty and the stock answer was to return the unit for repair.  Now with the refurb units, you have a 90 day warranty and the cost to replace just isn't worth it.  Customer service just doesn't really care about helping their customers.  I am a Cisco/Linksys Partner and reseller and I can't even get a response when I contacted them about the quality of their refurbished items.  I think much of this has occurred since they were aquired by Cisco.In general, I think the wireless manufacturers are going through a transition with so many devices that require connectivity (printers, TV's, DVR's, cameras, Apple devices, mobile devices, etc.).  This changes the game from the way it was even 3 years ago when the standard WRT54G wireless routers were sufficient for many users and for even most business applications.  The ISP's do their best to discourage networking and don't support any type of network product, so that just adds to the mix.  Right now, unless you buy the higher end units with more features to help with connectivity and throughput, you will be spending a lot of time troubleshooting your router.  The Linksys WRT routers just don't stand up to the test of time.  Hopefully the new series fixes a lot of the issues, but by all means AVOID any refurbished Linksys routers.",,,

But there 2 horrible things I have to point out:1. It does NOT support VPN connection. As an IT professional I tried many approaches I could think of and no success after a week. Also, I found countless same issues online without a solution. It looks like this is a product defect. Thinking of calling the tech support? Please keep reading.2. I believe I am not the first one saying this: Linksys has the most terrible technical support in the world. They do not have any technical background or whatsoever and only know some basic settings of the router. If changing those setting do not work, you are on your own. Furthermore, on top of everything, they speak horrible English with strong Indian (no offence) accent. I called for about 6 or 7 times and ended up the same place every time.In a word, it should be fine if you just need it for accessing internet but if you are working from home with VPN connection, do NOT buy it. And please bear in mind, their tech support will not help much if you run into any issues (and they will not escalate the issue if they cannot solve it), so you'd better have some tech background yourself.",,,

I wouldn't have called them just to have me go through all the troubleshooting steps on their website.

Connection and setup was a breeze, but when it came to streaming Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube through a wired connection to my desktop computer (and ultimately to my television which functions as a second desktop monitor), this router revealed its true colors. 10 minutes to load (if at all), sub-broadcast quality, and constant stuttering, this thing is useless for video streaming. I adjusted all of the router's settings (DHCP to Static Ip, Port Forwarding, UPnP, QoS, etc.) but nothing would alleviate the pitiful performance.Bottom line: Great if you need an easy-to-setup wireless network to check your email or browse the daily news, but don't waste your money if you watch any video at all over the internet.P.S. - I purchased the D-Link DIR-615 for $50 at Office Depot and have had no problems whatsoever with internet video streaming since then.

The wireless connection range and speed are satisfactory, but I haven't really done anything to really put a work load on it, so I can't say for sure it'll always be reliable. So far it's been good to me.The Network Magic software is basically pointless, unless you have no experience at all with computers and need someone to hold your hand through every step of setting things up. The fact that the basic package included with the product doesn't include the Pro features like shared printing and folders seems ridiculous. Why should I have to pay money for features that come free with Windows 7?On the bright side, the router seems to have no trouble serving a variety of different devices. The wireless printing did work during the free trial of Pro, and all our other computing devices, including my Windows laptop, a Mac OS X laptop, and a Nintendo Wii, have all been able to get on and stay on the network with no issues.Overall, the Linksys router is functional, but not the greatest investment I've ever made. For anyone looking to buy a wireless router, I would suggest doing some research and looking for a router that actually supports all the functionality it claims to (wireless printing, shared folders, etc) without asking you to pay extra for a software license. If you really can't afford a much better one, this router will work and serve you pretty well, but it's just not as good as similar wireless network devices.",,,

But that's par for the course with electronic equipment. What convinces me never to buy a Cisco product again is that their return policy for defective products requires the customer to pay to ship back the unit!

Finally had to run it with no security turned on for it to link up. So we have to make sure and unplug the router when not in use.It works fine now, we have a good signal anywhere in the house. Just no security turned on. I checked online forums for advice and carefully reread the directions. Whenever security is turned on at the router and the same settings are on the laptops they will not link up.

It worked for a month, but my internet speed was noticeably slower than if I plugged my PC straight into my modem (I had a wired connection from the PC to the router).  I had to quit using the Internet Explorer browser because it was too slow, and switch to the Opera browser, which seemed to make up for the speed difference.However, after a month this thing started giving me unusably slow internet speeds, like 900 bits per second over my 5 megabit cable connection.  Power cycling the modem and router got it back to normal for a week or so, but over the next couple of weeks it got worse and worse.  Finally, power cycling the modem and router three times resulted in this thing working for half an hour.  during this whole time, whenever I unplugged the PC from the router and plugged it straight into the modem, my internet speed was perfectly normal - zipping along nicely.  I tried everything- uninstall, re-install, install firmware update, I followed every bit of troubleshooting advice on the Linksys website as well as the internet in general - all of which was 100% useless.I really don't know what to do now.  It seems most routers have a good 20% - 25% of reviewers saying they have the same problem as I did, no matter which brand or model of router you're talking about.

In a hurry to replace it, I went local and bought a wrt54g2 thinking it should be as good or better than my old unit.  This is a downgrade, imo, from my old unit.  The first thing that should have clued me in is the lack of external antennae.  As could be expected, the range went down by about 15-20 feet in my house, enough to make reception in the kitchen a bit maddening.  Next, my voip phone quality took a nose dive, and it is plugged in directly to the router.  Even when I am in range to the wireless network, I am now sitting in my living room on the coffee table to write this because the reception in the kitchen is nails on chalkboard tedious, the performance is not as sharp and robust.  My wife hates it too.  I'm returning this as soon as my wrt54g-tm with the latest ddrt arrives in the mail.  For less money it has more than twice the ram, and with ddrt, according to other reviewers on the wrt54 with ddrt, provides much better range and consistency.

I have a PC I like to keep plugged in online with an ethernet cable and we have two PS3's in the house that we wanted to have online using the built in Wifi. It was recommended by several people to give this one a try.I purchased it and I can't believe how easy it was to install. It comes with a disc but I didn't even need it. Just plugged the PC and DSL modem into the router and within seconds I was back online with no configuration needed. Went to the PS3's and it only took me about a minute to configure them both which are in different rooms of the house and they were up and running with the Wifi connection.

My home computer is a Mac Mini.  I am about the least tech-savvy person there is so after reading some reviews, I was a bit ambivalent about whether or not I could handle the setup on my own.  It turned out to be incredibly easy and took all of 10 minutes.  The CD that comes with the router walks you through everything and does all the configuring for you.  It allowed me to name my network and password protect it.  I also found more detailed owner's manuals and troubleshooting guides on the Linksys site for anyone who wants to make any higher-tech changes or configurations.After configuring the router, I accessed my newly created wireless network from my laptop without a problem.  I can also use it for my iphone.This is a good little device and I found it to be quite user-friendly.  I did not have to contact Linksys tech support so I can't speak to how good or bad that is but one of my coworkers had some issues and tech support walked her through the setup over the phone and she was very satisfied.  I also don't intend to use the router with any other computers or gaming devices so I cannot address any issues there.

I was a little hesitant to purchase my first wireless router after watching the cable guy install the one I rented from them and reading all the technical stuff that the guys who deal with wireless networks had written in the reviews, but all I wanted was to have a wireless internet connection to my computer so I don't have to run cables around the house.  This was a good deal for the money and had good ratings, so I decided to try my luck.Installation was easy.  I just followed the steps on the install CD and in less than 10 minutes had a fully functional wireless internet connection.  Its a little faster than the previous wireless router that the cable company had given me and the connection is always great.My only complaint is that if my computer is off for more than 5 or 6 hours, the connection turns itself off (probably actually a good feature), and I have to manually turn it back on, but even that is just a matter of 2 clicks so it's not a big deal - an extra 5 seconds out of my day.It's a secure network with a password so no one else can log into the network but me, and the wireless management software that comes with it remembers all that, so there's no retyping passwords every time I want to log on.All in all, a very satisfying purchase for me and I'd recommend it to anyone.  Don't let the technical guys scare you with their reviews, this is easy to use and install.  :o)",,,

Network Magic slows down your internet connection and your network.  It's a good program for people who cannot set-up a network, but unless you have a very fast connection, it will be an irritant for many people.  Cisco does not give you a choice.

It finally died of old age but having been a quality router I ordered an exact model. It wouldn't even work so I returned it and chose this one as an upgrade. My original would send a signal from a room in the rear of my house the length of my house to the street. This was about 100ft. This router made by Cisco will give me a low or very low signal to my living room. This is about 25 feet or less. Then it will drop the connection and at it's convenience it will reconnect.,,,

455,XX,B0014J07R2,2,1,1,15-Mar-10,A2EOYZG2ET73HX,Not reliable compared to previous Linksys routers,"I don't often write reviews on Amazon, but I'm hoping this reaches someone before they buy this. For several years I have owned a Linksys WRT54G (v4), using the stock firmware. It was, and is, a great router. It's very reliable, and I have never had problems with it. I bought this router, the WRT54G2 because it was what was available in the store. This was an accessory gift for my in-laws, as I had just refurbished an old laptop for my mother-in-law, and I wanted her to be able to use it throughout the house.Setting up the router was easy, as is usually the case for me with Linksys routers. One gotcha was that our cable provider required me to clone the MAC address of the desktop. Other than that the wireless was up relatively quickly and the desktop and laptop were working great.The problems came shortly after I left, when the network went down and they lost internet on both desktop and laptop. A reset of the router fixed it. However, it was a fairly common problem. I went back over and tried different settings to fix it. As I did so, I noticed that the internet speed and quality was much much worse with the router than without (even with the wired connection). After much playing around, I swapped the router with my trusty WRT54G and, voila, everything worked fine and reliably. Taking the router back to my house and a different internet provider confirmed that the WRT54G2 is at fault.All in all I was disappointed with this purchase, having been so pleased in the past with Linksys. The remedy, in the end, was to purchase a used WRT54G and load it with DD-WRT. The WRT54G2 is now gathering dust.",,,

First we bought this Linksys router.  We recently purchased a Linksys cable modem (CM100) and thought if that worked well (which it did!), so would this router.  Big mistake.  Although this router looks good and has a lower price, it is 100% unreliable.  It has no external antennas and constantly lost the IP connections.  We even had trouble setting it up, which never has happened.  The most telling thing was my laptop kept defaulting to my neighbors wireless versus mine!  Our neighbor's signal was stronger than this piece of garbage.I found it amazing something brand new, by a good brand, was this horrible.  We were going back and forth resetting, troubleshooting, enough was enough.  Back it went and we bought a reliable router: D-Link DIR-628 with 2 external antennas.  We now enjoy 6x the speed of the Linksys router sold here.  Sure it costs thirty dollars more, but reliability is priceless!The D-Link DIR-628 pairs nicely with the CM100 Linksys cable modem, and both work nicely in Windows 7 and Linux Mandriva.Believe me and other people, don't waste your valuable time, SKIP THIS ONE.",,,

The network magic software included is ridiculous (in a bad way) and was unable to setup wireless internet correctly.I'm fairly competent with computers but this router system was really impossible to setup correctly. For the first week or so the router would have no connection to the internet even though the router signal was excellent and wired computers could access the internet. I fiddled with all the router settings following forum suggestions but nothing would fix the lack of internet connectivity through wireless. I was about to return the router when all of a sudden, through no identifiable change in settings, it started working all right enough that I didn't want to bother with the hassle of returning it.Since then, the router wireless internet connectivity has been unreliable even though signal strength remains excellent. Linksys makes crappy routers. I should have bought some other brand of router, I had originally bought the 54G as a replacement for an older linksys router that was buggy (I thought the issues were wear related... so wrong!).Anyway, in short if you are looking for a reliable router, don't buy this one.",,,

It was a network adapter problem.  Linksys website was no help on that.  Finally found on the website how to hook it and just plugged it in.  The security setting was another hour or more of trial an error but the website finally got me thru it.  Be careful of online help other then linksys as a few led me astray and cost me some time.So if you buy this product hope your one of the 5 or 10 min. installs like some other reviews and be prepared for some work if your not, if your not computer savvy I wouldn't take the chance.  I also will look for different network software from a third party as I'm afraid to stick the CD back in my machine for the cisco network software that's supposed to be included.  Good Luck!",,,

(The product is now 16 months old.) It starts out working, then, depending on the importance of whatever I am trying to download or upload, it runs slower and slower until it drops the connection, generally midstream in an essential email.AFter untold hours of troubleshooting, my cable provider had me remove the router from the system, which seemed to cure everything (although it left me without a wireless connection.) This was two days before my Linksys 1-year warranty expired, so I called Linksys instead of tossing it out.Linksys deemed my router perfectly healthy, so I reinstalled with their assistance (paying for this assistance for the second time, as my IP address had been changed by the cable co. during troubleshooting and this somehow required changes to the set up that I am simply too dim to accomplish myself.) It works, sometimes. Less and less often over time.So here I sit, thoroughly out of warranty, having paid for one router and two installations, trying, with the last remnants of my poor, dim, mind, to do the math.

At this point, I should have called my DSL ISP (just like it says to do in the directions). I didn't do that because my experience with customer service has not been great. You know, long wait times, 'technicians' who must follow a script rather than  getting to the heart of the issues, etc. Anyway, I opted to call my brother-in-law who's a network guy and we did a lot of stuff, but to no avail. He said I'd have to call customer service. So, the next day I called my ISP. To my surprise, I didn't have to wait. The tech was friendly and professional and we were on line in less than 10 minutes. Incidentally, we didn't do anything I hadn't done before with my brother-in-law, I assume the tech did the real job from his end. My advice, if your router doesn't find the internet on the first try, call your ISP.Since getting online, I haven't had any problems.

Power stabilizer chip burnt out after wrong power adapter was plugged in. Yes, it was mistake of that guy of course, however this router has very common power connector, and it slips out very easy unless your router is wall-mounted. So if you have several power adapters plugged into one cable extender, you have great chance to make a blunder.My g2 worked fine for about a year and then become to lose packets. It worked without losses after being powered off for a hour or more, but 10-15 minutes of warming-up was enough to start to lose up to 60% of packets again. I suspect there is a microcrack in the PCB. So this one is dismissed too now.With that said, g2 has WPA2 support and good web interface. Though QoS settings and diagnostic interface are poor, I'd like to see more functionality there.What I plan to buy instead? Something with more RAM and Flash ROM, that would allow to use OpenWRT and have console access. And without 'fake Cisco' logo now.",,,

Speeds weren't great but it was absolutely getting the job done. It only dropped internet occasionally and didn't give me too many problems. Then I updated the firmware and it all went down hill. Now the router has all kinds of glitches rangeing from one or two devices unable to to connect to the internet to all of my devices unable to connect to the internet. If I reset the router it will allow everyone to get back on the internet for at least a few hours. It has gotten so bad that we put the router on a switched outlet so that we can just flip the switch to reset it. All of my troubleshooting and requests for tech support have resulted in all sorts of things to try to remedy the problem. Why do I need to troubleshoot a product that I buy? If I buy a car and it only starts occasionally and sometimes just stops running, they don't send me suggestions on how to fix it. Why do computer hardware companies expect thier customers to troubleshoot a faulty product. When will these companies start making products that are actually plug and play? So frustrating!",,,

Whilst there are now N and N+ units out there, the Cisco G unit does absolutely fine (speed wise) for my PC, 3 laptops, X-Box and iPods, as well as my internet phone.I don't use the Network magic software (need to buy !), but was easily able to set up a home network (that includes wireless printing) using Vista.In terms of reliability, I havce been used to re-booting both the cable modem and router on previous setups ; the Cisco unit has yet to need a reboot to overcome hang situations.

498,XX,B0014J07R2,5,0,0,7-Feb-10,A3NU0X2SZGO7Y1,Third Linksys Router in Three Years,"This is an attractive, sleek, low profile wireless router that easily disappears into the background, even at night.  The indicator lights aren't overly bright, and it is quiet and functional.It was extremely easy to set up, we had service up and running in no time at all.  The enclosed DVD makes set up idiot proof.We are a light traffic household, with three laptops and one hard wired desktop using the unit.  We have no issues with speed (sorry FIOS, your DSL line is still instantaneous and too good to switch for the cost increase!) and have had to reset the unit for connectivity once (since purchase) this past weekend following a good snow storm.The true test of this router will be the length of time it provides trouble free service.  The last two Linksys WRT Routers I purchased developed connectivity issues that required calls to Linksys tech support and a long drawn out reset process (changing IP address, resetting software, re-establishing connectivity) within the first six months of service.This became a time consuming event each time, i.e., 45 minutes to two hours depending on the country/skill level of the tech receiving the customer service call.  It was usually a long and frustrating endeavor without lasting results.  Invariably, I'd be on the phone again in two or three days, though there were times it was truly a few weeks later before the same problem would resurface.  Repeat process multiple times until the one year warranty expired.Linksys customer reps will offer you the opportunity to purchase a service plan for about five dollars less than a new unit to cover six technical events or six months of technical issues, which ever comes first.  As the technical issues were the same each time I called for tech support, I elected to buy this new unit instead.We've used the same Linksys WRT Router at work for seven years with no issues, with the occasional reset after a storm, though not one call required to customer service.  I'm hopeful that 'this high speed low drag router' will be the one that takes care of the household for the next five to ten years.  And yes, I do have the router plugged into a surge protector!  I'm looking forward to the next years' time spent not even remembering that this quiet little unit is humming away in the back ground trouble free.  I'll let you know if it bucks the trend or follows suit in 2011!",,,

500,XX,B0014J07R2,5,0,0,6-Feb-10,A3A4UKJUP34E18,Great priced wireless router with plenty of expansion capability,"Bought this to be able to not only have my desktop internet capable but also my new Dell laptop.  I use it as a LAN device for the desktop and wireless for the laptop.  I have the router upstairs in my office and the laptop is used in the kitchen.  No problems so far.  When I did run into a reprogramming issue because of switching to Win 7 and doing a clean install, I had to contact Linksys.  I did it through their live chat.  (sorry to say I have to much trouble listen and understanding techs from India with their accents)  The live chat person was wonderful and I was up and running in a short time. Had I known what to do, I would have gone directly to their site and done it.  After the first time using the CD it is worthless if you need to go back to it.  It doesn't work again if you have already once installed and programmed the router.",,,
501,XX,B0014J07R2,5,3,3,5-Feb-10,A24E5DR9VQTKBA,Great router,"I am completely satisfied with this router. Perhaps because I had lower expectations after reading some of the negative reviews, I was expecting some of the same issues, including dropped connections. I had none of those problems. I popped in the CD, followed the simple instructions, and was up in running in less than 15 minutes. The Network Magic software seemed helpful for my modest needs. It is the Pro version, which works for 7 days. After that, it defaults to the Basic version unless you purchase it for $39.95, which I didn't do. Basic is plenty adequate for my needs. And unlike others, I haven't been plagued with nag screens at all, asking me to upgrade. Maybe the newer version of the software doesn't do this.To me, the best thing that can be said for a router is that it becomes 'transparent' to the user. It just works without incident. For the most part, this has been the case. Now, I am not trying to run a complex network off a $45 router, with a dozen wireless devices. I have a new desktop PC with Win 7 and two notebooks in the house. That's it. I just wanted it for notebook wireless access. The only real issue I had in the beginning is that when I was using my notebook computer, I noticed that the speed seemed to fluctuate from 54bps to 48, 36, 11, etc. I solved this by doing some research on the Linksys User Forum. I discovered that the default channel on the router is 6 and that others suggested switching it to 1 or 11 so as not to conflict with wireless phones, other networks in the neighborhood, etc. I did this, and my connect speed on my notebook has been rock solid at 54bps.As a side note, I avoid calling tech support at all cost. Most products now have user forums online, and I find that these are far more useful, less frustrating and more helpful than trying to talk to young Ramesh or Parmeshwar in India -- after a 50-minute wait on the phone. I went to the Linksys site, did a search on my issue in the user forum (fluctuating speed) and had the problem solved in 5 minutes.I am very pleased with this router and recommend it without hesitation.",,,

Now I wish I could get my money back. Two of the ports on the router are dead--they don't hold the cable in and they don't transfer data. When connecting  to the wireless or wired, I have to reset the adapters on my computer because the router doesn't allow me to connect right away. Sorry Linksys, but I won't be buying another product from you guys. You did serve me well a while ago, but not anymore.'UPDATE February 21, 2010: 'Although I originally stated that I was extremely disappointed, it wasn't the router's fault. The router actually resolved the issue itself. It was an issue with our Internet Service Provider (ISP, Comcast) as if there's a shocker, but I don't want to talk about that. So, if this router proves to be reliable for a long time, I will happily buy a Linksys router again. Sorry if this is confusing.'",,,
505,XX,B0014J07R2,5,1,1,2-Feb-10,AQREGOA044IWN,"Overall, a great inexpensive router","Before I bought this wireless router, I made sure to read through a lot of reviews regardless if they're negative or positive.  Every router you find, there will always be about a 50/50 terrible and positive reviews so I was back to square one.  Since Linksys was most reputable and had great pricing, I opted to try out this new wireless router.  Upon installation, the Internet speed was blazing.  I wasn't sure if it was the router or maybe just less people online at the time since I have cable Internet.  The CD was super easy to follow.  It goes through a step by step detailed wizard that helps you setup your network access and security (you technically do not have to use the CD, but it is tons easier if you do unless you're an advanced network user and know how to set everything up manually in the Linksys configuration window if Internet Explorer).  Network Magic software is so cool.  You can see what computer has access to your network, who to boot off, etc.  Nice graphical presenation.  Too bad it's a shareware and you have to purchase it after like so many days.  Great software nonetheless.  I would love to keep using it.I chose the highest security encryption and also performed MAC filtering.  I hear people say that the more security you add, the slower your network.  That has not been the case for me.  My laptop access is just as fast as it was before when it was 'hard-wired'.  My desktop PC uses direct Net access with a cable, so that one always have a super fast connection.  I do notice there's a split second delay at times, but still fast.  Signals are at full strength reading 'Excellent'.  I live upstairs in an apartment complex.  I use net access from clear across the room to the bedroom on the opposite side of the apartment.  Still has strong signal and fast Internet speeds.Overall, very easy to setup, easy to follow directions, and just easy to use.  There are external ports in the back that allow more PC connections using an Ethernet cable if you wish, or just go wireless.  If you go wireless, you'll need to add your laptop to your network by signing in with the encryption key and add their MAC address (if you have MAC filtering setup).  It's pretty much that simple.  I've seen kids setup home networks for their parents and this is no exception.  I paid forty five dollars for this product.  At Best Buy for the exact same model, you're paying at least fifteen dollars more.  Good value for a great router.",,,

512,XX,B0014J07R2,4,2,2,23-Jan-10,A212MDP6K4VJS5,Worked Flawless for 18 Months,"I have been buying Linksys routers since before Cisco bought them and this is my 4th one. Usually, they last about 3-4 years before issues start to show up. I have had 3 wireless units and one non-wireless that was replaced by a wireless unit. This one has lasted less then 2 years. The problem is that is stops broadcasting a signal intermittently. All of our laptops have become suddenly disconnected while the wired units stay connected to the Internet. If it wasn't for the units having issues with reliability, I would give it 5 stars for ease of use and how well it works. Also, once you set one up, its easy to get in and configure the software, it hasn't changed much since the first one I owned in the late 90s. Sigh, now I have to figure out which router to get. The last one I had was a Belkin, but it started having reliability issues at 3-4 years, I initially replaced that with a D-Link router which I could not get to work and finally settled on this model.1/27/10 UPDATE: After searching Linksys user forums, I decided to update the firmware. My feelings on things like firmware is, if its not broke, don't fix it. Well, it was broke. Then, I got slow speed over the wireless connection issues, it dropped to about 1/3 over the wireless then the wired connection (2-3mps wireless vs 6mps wired). Although I did a reset and put the information back it, it still was only about 1/2 the wired speed. I started to think that some of these new wireless values added with the new firmware needed tweaking, so I started doing that with no increase in speed (and not really knowing what I was doing). Finally I did a power recycle and that brought it back up to speed on the wireless end and its been up without drops since the date of this review. I revised my review from a 3 to 4 star. Someone not technical would have probably just replaced it, another reason for 4 stars.",,,

I always end up calling the tech support to ask them for help in speeding up the internet. They are very supportive. Somehow I always end up with mediocre internet speed and I call them again. I don't use my laptop at as much, so I can't say I hate the router. If I did use the internet for more than 4 hours a day at home, than this router is horrible! You will get reception with this router, but you will also get disconnected many times from the network, which is very frustrating.

As long as you connect everything properly, you shouldn't have any problems. I've never needed to use Linksys customer support, so I personally can't say whether or not they're helpful. My wife has, however; and she says that when she accidentally reset the network and changed our network password, they tried to charge her $30 for a one year 'Password reset', or $50 for a one-time password reset. Why would you have to pay to reset your own password? Ridiculous. BUT, like I said, I personally have never had to deal with Linksys customer support so I can't say...but I have heard stories.Just install/connect everything properly, follow the instructions, do it right, and just like anything else you won't have any issues with it not working properly.",,,

I was very unhappy to quickly find out that Linksys canned their original style for their modems and routers to go with this new design.Installation/Hookup is very easy and quick; same as all their previous routers. However, my model died after 32 days of use. I returned it to the store only to have the new unit die a week later. The store was sold out of the WRT54GS so I had no choice but to get what was available, the WRT120N. Long story short, after going through 5 of these new model routers and have them all fail, I purchased the old style WRT54GL and have had 0 issues.Be warned, Linksys routers have a tendency to die a few months of of their warranty (1 Year). Avoid this unit at all costs, they're not reliable. Go with the older WRT54GL or WRT54GS if you can find them.",,,

I did online chat which worked well, but all they did was have me switch mtu from 1500 to 1492 and said to call back if the problem didn't go away and request an RMA. I called today, but there was no RMA option so I picked support. I told the tech I needed an RMA only to have to give all of my information again just so she could tell me I selected the wrong option on the phone menu and I needed to call back.

I rebooted my PC and tried several times with no luck. I also pulled up help links with tech support without success.Then I tried calling customer service. The first two times I called the wait time was 45 minutes AND I NEVER GOT A PERSON!I had to have access to more than one computer so I hard wired everything in to the router which worked.When I got back to calling customer support to get the WIRELESS part of the wireless router working...I was told that my router was out of warranty and there would be a charge to give me support. The support staff was also very rude and disorganized.update: 6 months later - I gave this router to a family member and they had continuous problems with it...even when only using the back of the device as a router (not using the wireless part).

After an experienced computer guy came over and it took him TWO HOURS to hook up my computer to that router, I realized it wasn't me.

531,XX,B0014J07R2,2,0,0,30-Dec-09,AXS72HY1AFVEG,Beware Linksys products,"I suggest that you get several opinions before buying anything from Linksys or Cisco. Perhaps I have just had 5 or 6 unlucky experiences in a row. Bad days happen and even great companies and great support people have bad days.I've been computing about 15 yrs and consider myself Intermediate.I bought a Linksys router about 5 years ago and was always very well treated by their knowledgeable and efficient support people. I did not need them often because the router worked very, very well.But, my experiences this year cause me to believe that the repeated incompetent support that I have gotten from Linksys guarantees that I will not buy anything else with a Linksys name or Cisco.First we bought a WRT54G2 in June 2009 when the old Linksys router died. One port was found to be erratic when we tried to add a 3rd computer. Then the troubles began. The technician  refused to cross ship the replacement. But after I hung up, I found that their website offers it, so I called back.  The 2nd technician  refused to cross ship the replacement until I forcefully pointed out that their website offers that. When the new router arrived I could not get it to recognize any of our computers. Their support guy took quite a while to answer and by the time he did the router had healed itself and was working, but he insisted in making a bunch a setting changes that seemed unrelated. When he kept insisting to set up the WiFi even though I repeatedly told him that we do not HAVE any WiFi computers here, I hung up.I am OK with off shore support >IF&lt; they know what they are doing. I have no problem with script readers that are useful, but this one was brain dead.Later his colleague attempted to charge me before he would answering the question 'Will my WUSB600B Ver 1 USB WiFi stick work on Windows 7.I bought it less than 10 months ago. It has 12 months support warranty. (By the way it won't as far as I can tell.)Another tech was going to charge me $10 to show me how to get it to work. They seem to work on the baksheesh philosophy.Then they tried to charge me a support fee before they would tell me how much repairing the 5 year old, out of warranty router would be. And the list goes on. Sadly, more and more things cause me to say to me that the company that I regarded highly for years is no more and should be avoided like the plague. But ask around for >recent&lt; experiences, because they used to be good. I hope they come back someday.",,,
532,XX,B0014J07R2,1,1,2,29-Dec-09,A2U41LDJ7ZLW5J,Big Brother is Watching,"I bought the router to replace an older Linksys that died.  Once installed, surfing the net was noticeably slower.  The BIG issue, however, is the Cisco/Linksys 'Home Network Defender' firewall.  Do you use Facebook/MySpace?  Not anymore!  One of the political blogs I visit often includes frivolous links to more light-hearted items.  For example: '14 Ill-advised tattoo trends.'  Cisco/Linksys has decreed those trends are best left to my imagination.  Tattoos=Porn, evidently.  While researching a paper, I googled 'Founding Fathers and Alcohol.'  Tried to access one of the sites, and was stopped in my tracks by: 'The parental controls block websites in this category:  Alcohol/Tobacco/Illegal Drug.'This wouldn't be an issue if the firewall could be adjusted/disabled/removed.It can't.Home Network Defender does not appear in the 'Add/Remove Programs' roster - it's hardwired into the router.  The owner's manual provides no instructions for changing the settings.  I spent 7 freaking hours on the phone with Linksys/Cisco inept Indian customer support (who immediately tried to sell me some software to address the problem), to absolutely no avail.  Ditto for my own online efforts to locate a solution.  All I came up with was horror story after horror story.  My fault, I guess, for not doing any research before I bought the damnable thing.If you're fond of bogged-down surfing, and an arrogant corporation dictating which sites you can an cannot visit, getcherself a Linksys WRT!Me, I'm going with Netgear.",,,
533,XX,B0014J07R2,4,0,0,28-Dec-09,A2D278XR2DR3IN,needed tweaking for ps3 & wii,"Overall very happy with this router after the initial setup.  Easy to setup up my Mac laptop with the included ethernet cable and CD software. My only problems was setting up my game systems neither the PS3 or Wii could find the wireless router. I was a bit frustrated because some of the game forums had actually recommended this router.  After more game forum reviewing and looking at the router manual on the CD I found that I could change the wireless frequency it transmits on.  Basically theres about 11 different gHz frequencies that you can tune it to.  I found 11 to be the one that both the Wii and PS3 liked.  I don't have an Xbox, so I can't tell you about it.  Its a bit more challenging to access the router, but basically you open up your internet browser, I have firefox, and direct it to the 9 digit address given in the manual, enter the password and then adjust the frequency.  I think the price was great at 40 bucks, has great range, and so far no freeze ups like my old PCI router.",,,

535,XX,B0014J07R2,4,0,0,28-Dec-09,A2O74WBGST28A8,Works well but I hate it when it disconnects,"I was looking for a good wireless router for use in our home and I saw this one and liked its price and how it looked. I like the fact that it has 4 ethernet ports so you can hook up more computers to it. Installation was smooth and only took me about 10 mins. It has holes at the back so that it can hang on screws/nails so I installed it on the side of my computer table so I don't add to the clutter. The Wireless reception is ok and I get good reception using my laptop either upstairs or on the basement. The only thing I hate about it is that I often lose internet connection. I'm sure it's not my internet connection since I've never had this problem before and when I plug the cable directly to my desktop or laptop, the internet works fine. Then I'd have to unplug it, wait 10 secs. then plug it again which is a hassle since I lose my internet around 3-4x/week. There might be settings that I'm missing but I don't know. Currently the solution of pulling the plug and plugging it after 10 secs. usually solves the disconnection problem. It comes with network magic which 'reminds' you to try out their pro version.",,,
536,XX,B0014J07R2,5,2,2,26-Dec-09,A2IV4JMZJRXEPQ,Works like a charm so far,"I went over tons of reviews, including the 5 stars, 1 stars, & 2 stars the most, for this and other versions of this, plus the Belkin models and others even.  I came to the conclusion on getting this one, because it seemed to suit what I'd be using it for, to share the connection so I have access to Xbox Live. Mainly to get DLC for games, any updates for the system, news, watch previews for games & movies, possibly even try streaming some movies to watch, & try out some arcade games. Basically, anything you can get w/o a Gold Membership.I got the new version of the Xbox network adapter, the black 1 w/ 2 antennas, and yes I know, that supports the N band, so why not get a router that uses the N band or has both the G & N?  Because most of the ratings and reviews for those, for Linksys and other types, were pretty bad, some had just as many 1 stars as 5 stars, some had more 1 stars than 5 & 4 stars, and well, you get the idea. Some stated for a few of the 'N' versions that it was rushed and that's why it has problems.  While this model may have 100 1 stars (at the time of this writing), it has close to 4 times as many 5 stars, and that's not even mentioning the 4 star ratings.I noticed 1 pattern the most while reading all of the 1 star ratings for this, a lot of people had trouble getting it to work with their laptop, or couldn't get it to work with it at all, so yes, if you want to use it for use with your laptop, I do recommend reading the 1 star reviews and comments for them, to get an idea of what to expect, and find and solutions beforehand (what I do usually, I bookmarked certain comments/discussions that talk about what to do if 'this' or 'that' happens).  Others had trouble w/ installation, maybe they got a dud, it happens, doesn't necessarily make it a bad product though, I could of gotten a crappy one, stuff happens, problem is people base most things on first impressions.  Some people had massive trouble with installation, maybe their computers weren't 100% compatible w/ the router,I don't know, I've seen some people mention some of the computers or setups  they have, and I have no clue what they're talking about, lol.  Me, I have a Dell Computer that is 6 years old, currently using XP w/ service pack 3, and I had no issues whatsoever with installation, it was pretty quick and painless.  Frankly, I thought there would of been more to it, more manual labor, but, nope.  But, maybe it's because I have a basic setup, who knows.Hell, I had more problems with the Xbox network adapter and getting into Live than with the router.  First, the disc that comes with it (which I need to install because I've never been connected before) says mixed media so it won't read, unless (and I found out this next part by, you guessed it, reading the reviews & comments of the product) you keep the disc in there, make sure the 360 is set to read the disc when you turn the system on, then, turn the 360 off, then back on, then it will work.  That wasn't even the hardest part, I already had a Windows Live account (different gamertag name and everything than the 1 associated w/ my offline tag, didn't have the intent on getting Live back then), which you had to enter the email & password for on the 360, but it's with a different gamertag, so I couldn't get into Live unless I joined as a new member, but then all my achievements, etc, won't show.  So, I had to make a new Windows Live account, then tried to log into Live again on the 360, using the new email & password, and voila!, it worked, took me a while to figure that out though, and after reading a bunch of help topics on migrating, etc.  Needless to say, I spent a lot more time than with the router, the router was the easy part.If you follow the instructions on the screen to the letter, as in, carefully and by-the-book after putting the installation disc in for the router, you 'should' have no trouble at all. yes, it does install Network Magic, which expires after a week and then from what people are saying (I've had this 2 days), asks for money, if that's the case, just uninstall it, people said.  Anyway, onto the last and other important stuff, my 360 is nestled in an entertainment stand with my VCR, and PS2, it is about 30 feet roughly away from where I have the router, since my computer is in the bedroom.  The signal has to travel down the hall, and go around 1 wall, but as for how many walls it would have to pass through (though I imagine if it can avoid going through then it would?), there's 3, and then pass through the wood of the entertainment stand of course. The only interference would be the microwave nearby, and my cell phone pretty much.  Also, the 360 controller I have is wireless, and that works on the 2.4Ghz bandwith as does the router, but, I have had no problems whatsoever so far.  I was watching game demos and movie demos with no interruption/stutter/slowdown.I downloaded the 2 DLC's for Dragon Age, the biggest one, I think it was 296 Mb's, took just under 4 minutes, the other one that was 139 Mb's took like 2 minutes, if that even.  A while ago I downloaded the arcade free trial for some Pirate game, can't think of the name right now, but that was 553 Mb's and I timed that one to the letter, it took 7 minutes and 14 seconds to finish.  That, to me, is pretty darn good, I figured it would take a LOT longer, or maybe I just have low standards/expectations. Oh yeah, before I forget, you know where it shows you the connection for the 360, there's 4 bars there, just like for a cell phone, well, I have 3 lit, I think that's pretty good.  So, 3 lit for about 30 feet away, maybe a bit more.I did get a free 1 month trial to the Gold membership, so I did some other stuff like try the 1 vs 100 (which I love), and I had no issues with that either, like it's stated in the title, works like a charm so far.  Also, doing things by-the-book means putting in the installation disc first, BEFORE you do any connecting of wires, when it's time to connect something, like disconnect the ethernet cable from your computer and connect it to the router, and then connect the router to the pc, it will prompt you, I bet there's some people who connect stuff before they are told, and yes, believe it or not, that can cause problems and even screw up the whole installation. If you are using for Xbox Live, make sure when it's time to name the router, you name it something you will recognize, really, if you keep it as Linksys, nothing more, when the 360 has to search for routers in the area, there will be a list if there's a lot using them also, and you have to find yours on the list, just a piece of advice.",,,
537,XX,B0014J07R2,1,6,6,24-Dec-09,A2VQUXAGEGNUX1,"Bad product, worse customer service","I purchased two of these.  I installed one and it is working.  I'd rate that installation as about medium.  It wasn't as easy as the installation instructions suggest, but it was manageable for someone with well above-average technical acumen.  If you don't have good technical acumen, I'd buy elsewhere or invest the money in having a computer expert install it for you.The second router ultimately never installed.  I found myself on the phone with Linksys (in, of course, India) for many hours.  At first they did not want to help me at all.  They told me that, even though I had just purchsed the item, that it was out of warranty.  Why?  Well, it turns out that Amazon and their pass-thru vendor sold me hardware that was EIGHT generations/versions old!  Never did it say anywhere that I was not getting the most current unit.  Anyway, I negotiated my way through that.  But, Amazon, it would have been good to know this up front in the listing.Then it was about spending hours trying to get them to troubleshoot the unit.  In the end they decided that it could not be connected and that it was defective.  They told me that they would send instructions via e-mail that would allow me to send it back to them for replacement (at my cost of course).  They NEVER did.  When I called again, and waited on the phone again, they did not have record of my case number and they started the whole 'this isn't covered by warranty' discussion again.  I decided at that point that the hassle they were putting me through was not worth the money I'd get back.  So, I cancelled the call and decided to just eat the cost.I did later contact the pass thru vendor for the product via e-mail.  In a short note I told them of my issue and they very willingly agreed to take the product back and give me a refund.  So, all I'm out is the shipping cost and about 10 hours of my time.Linksys, your customer service is really, really horrible.  I can't imagine how someone without any technical skills would have dealt with this issue.  You should be ashamed at yourselves.",,,
538,XX,B0014J07R2,4,0,0,23-Dec-09,A2WZ5I61UHL8K0,"Very satisfied for home use, reasonalby for business","I have purchased two of these, this one some time ago for use in my home. I used it with DSL without issue. I converted to cable and purchased the Linksys cable modem with wireless and had trouble. So I brought the one I used with DSL out, hooked it to the cable mode and have excellent service once again. Now the cable modem is just that and doesn't serve any wireless connections. This recent router was purchased for our church. I hooked it up in the office so I could have wireless connections in the sanctuary and various rooms. Here, the issue is strength of the signal. It was not strong enough to give me a good connection in the sanctuary. I choose to connect the Pastor and Receptionist office computers directly with cable since they were close enough to the router. Then I purchased the Linksys cable signal booster. After configuring it and placing near the sanctuary computer, my signal strength went to excellent (all the way up) and the internet works flawlessly. I got a refurbished signal booster for $35. For a business or church, this is a reasonable expense to get such good overage. Given my overall experience, I am very satisfied and do not hesitate to recommend these products. Though it may not be necessary, I try to keep all my equipment from the same manufacturer. I've been writing computer program for over 30-years and have been in the middle of the 'It's their fault' wars when you have multiple manufacturers involved. Linksys equipment is reasonably priced, has worked well for me and I have been given good support when needed. So I'll keep using them for all my wireless compoents (cards, routers and boosters).",,,
539,XX,B0014J07R2,4,0,0,21-Dec-09,A1NCT69CV5XS6E,Installation and use,"This router installed easily using the included CD.  It works fine, using an ethernet connection to one computer and wireless connections to two others.  My only negative finding is that its range is much shorter than I anticipated.  Admittedly, some cabinets and bookcases intervene, but about 25 feet away it produces only two bars on a computer with an external antenna to its adapter card.  Up one floor and about fifty feet away, we could only generate one bar and frequent disconnections and very slow speed.  Having bought a fine Hawking range extender, and placed it about 25 feet away from the router, we get three and sometimes four bars in the second case.  If you have the same difficulty, buy a Hawking.  And recognize that the g specification is yesterday's technology.  Get a router with the n specification.",,,

The wired connection worked great for my PS3/PC and the wireless was spot on in the whole condo.  My wife's laptop was Wireless B so there was never a need to upgradeWe recently moved to a 3 level house and while the router still worked, the performance was poor outside of the immediate vicinity of our office (one end of the house on the second floor).Fast forward to buying this router, all of a sudden my wireless range increased vastly from one end of the house to the other.  I could actually sit on my deck a level up or in my garage one floor below on the other side of the house and still get a decent wireless signal.  For PS3 gaming, it was an improvement but not enough as I ended up paying to re-do some wiring to get a wired connection for my games room, but that is not the fault of the router.The stability of a Linksys router can not be doubted and is excellent.One other point for those technically savvy - you can hack this router to get access to tweaks that are only available on $500+ routers.

I made the mistake of installing Network Magic - a trial-ware software for managing my internal network.  It wasn't really necessary and ended up causing problems with printing on network computers.  The biggest disappointment has been the wireless coverage - which is why you buy a wireless router.  The coverage hasn't been as good as my previous 4 year old router, which seemed to be dying recently.  In addition, the new router seems to drop coverage frequently, leading to very annoying, frequent, re-connects.  If I had it to do over I would spend a little more for a higher quality router.",,,

If I connected to the cable modem directly, the connection was fine. But after plugging my computer into the router, both the LAN and Wi-Fi slowed down. It was obvious the source was the router.

Since there is a sticker on the ports of the router saying that you have to install the software first, I installed the software without connecting the router. It stuck at checking connection page and saying there's some problem with wireless adapter. After tried several things out and not able to get it working, I decided to call Sisco's 'Award Winning Tech Support'.The first thing made me uncomfortable is they ask your name(full name), phone number and e-mail. I was not cautious enough so I give out my phone number but not e-mail address. They won't inform you providing those information are optional until you decide not to tell. I wonder those personal information has anything to do with installing the router.Than the tech support kept asking me to spend around 9 dollar to have someone take over my computer and take a look at it. She kept saying that is the best way to resolve my problem.I have been using 'Log me in' to access my office computer at home and I know what it's like to have some one remote access your computer. They can do whatever they want, including lock up your screen, keyboard and mouse. Therefore I turned down her offer and ask if she able to advice via phone. She still insist on the 'remote plan'. I told her I rather try to install again by myself and end up the conversation.After I tried to connect the router to the network while installing the software, everything works out fine. I am glad I didn't pay 9 dollar for doing this.Thank you award winning tech support for wasting me 20 minutes!(I am not complaining about individual tech support but whoever wrote their SOP)",,,

I originally had some issues getting it installed, but I logged in to Linksys's chat support and a tech (who seemed to speak perfect English & had a name such as 'Jason') talked me through the setup process.

Pretty good considering it's a decent sized brick house and I just have the router thrown under a desk in the office.We are definitely not doing anything fancy so I can't really comment on too many features.,,,
611,XX,B0014J07R2,1,1,1,5-Oct-09,A2G4GFSK8SNATW,only one star due to the broken unit,"Do not consider my review as a real review. I just want to point that this is very good router when it works.In two years period I bought already four of them (for friends and family) however I got two which were broken (one not working at all , one had maximal signal recognized as a two bars on three independent computers standing next to it, it was also getting very hot). So it seems for me that the quality of products made by Linksys is not as good as it was before - new owner?? new quality control??, or whatever??. Personally I use very old D-link for four years and very old liksys (three years) and have no problems with them. I hope your router will work from the first day for years.",,,
612,XX,B0014J07R2,1,0,0,2-Oct-09,A2CGVALF0LKY3W,Totally aggravating!!!,"I installed this router five days ago.  I have had to call tech support four times.  Each time I was on the phone over an hour.  It is now midnight on the fifth day and it stopped working again.  I have had to reattach the ethernet cable directly from the modem to the desktop to be able to work online again. The tech support people are clueless.  My only regret is that I had to give this product one star; it doesn't even deserve that.  BTW, the desktop and the laptop are in the same room as the router, so no excuse there.  Do yourself a favor, don't buy this piece of junk.",,,

Finally, I switched the ethernet cable provided by Linksys (the blue one) with my own and it worked. Interestingly (or not), this blue cable works OK from router to my PC.Now, after couple of months of non-stop usage (inc. heavy download), I'm amazed by stability of this router, both wired and wirelessly. During that period, it was the only thing that never failed which I can't tell about either my ADSL modem or even my iMac ethernet (!).",,,

The router was frequently losing connection to the internet that I believe was caused by how hot it got.  I would recommend hanging it on the wall, leave the screws out a little so there is a gap to dissipate heat easier.  Also hanging it closer to the floor where the cooler air is helps to.  Seems to work better when I did this.Not very happy with the range and strength of signal either.  Had an old router that recently failed.  My old router, that never made any claims about extended range, had better range than my new Linksys that claims to have extended range.  There was no better connection even though it sat in the same spot as my old router or the new spot on the wall closer to the floorI bought this a week ago at Staples and normally I don't write reviews for something that I bought this recently so I will update this review in the future.(edited October 15 2009)Don't install Net Magic!

When I returned and after 4 hours on the phone with Linskys technicial reps, it was deceided that the unit was defective.  I am very dissapointed.  It worked once and that was it. It cost me $12.00 buks to send it to california.  After they receive it, they in turn will send me a replacement.  According to their instructions, it may be replaced with a different unit if they choose to do that.  I would have prefered to return it to Amazon, however, that is not how it goes.  To say the least, I am very dissapointed.  I did a great deal of research before purchasing the Linskys.AFter this experience, not to mention 4 hours on the phone with the Philipines was unbareble.  If you think Dell is a problem talking to Bombay, think again before purchasing a Linskys.  4 hours is too much time to waste.  If you are experienced in technology and know computers and they work, don't watse your time trying to explain to technicians that have no clue of what you are talking about.

Sleek in look,easy to use and no problem in access range.But after 4-5 month of use it started showing low signals event when I am only 10 feet away from it. and sometime limited connectivity also.May be that affected to my internet speed also. I always kept wondering whether it is my router or net which one is making my net slow.After 10 month of use it stopped working at all. It is not taking ip from my internet connection when I check with the web interface though it was getting connected wirelessly to laptop.I tried to reset it to factory settings which means re installation using CD. But guess what it was not detecting the ethernet connection and always saying that 'Your Ethernet cable doesn't appear to connect properly' and I don't thinkg it going to work at all.As per my guess all its physical port gone malfunctioned and that is the reason it is not taking ip of my internet connection.[...].Only one reason I can think for its failure that router use to be powered on most of the time so it might lead to early death of this product.

My room is the furthest from the router in the house, and my laptop will only pick up a '4 out of 5' signal. By no means is this signal poor, but I would have liked to have '5 out of 5'. Another curious thing is that the orientation of the router itself changes the signal my laptop receives in my room. For example, when the router is towards the back of the computer nook downstairs, I only receive a '3 out of 5' signal, but when the router is moved to the front of the nook, the signal improves to a '4 out of 5'.

645,XX,B0014J07R2,2,1,1,2-Sep-09,ARRAW98APM1HX,Worked for a while,"I purchased this item about 6 months ago and thought this topic needed to be brought out.I replaced an older Linksys router this this one because of 2 reasons:1) My cable modem is a Linksys and I thought they would 'talk' better back and forth, and2) My old Linksys, while hanging and pausing frequently, still was pretty bullet-proof.Setup was moderately easy and I was rocking. The problems started about 3 months ago when I would lose internet service on the weekends. Turning off and on, disconnecting the cable from the modem, etc. All the things I loathe to do with Wi-Fi equipment. The stuff should be setup and forgotten about. Last weekend there was no getting the unit back. My laptops saw and connected to the router but the communication between the cable modem and this unit was gone and not coming back. Maybe I wore out the reset switch! Any way, while I was looking at any other brands but Linksys, I found more than a few people saying there were looking to replace their WRT54G2 because it had died after only __ months (fill in 4 to 8 here). Any way, I'm not interested in dealing with getting and setting up a new router every 6 months. I'm going with someone else. I hooked up my old Linksys, pauses and all (yes I've messed with packet sizes), and will buy something hopefully a little more reliable this week.",,,

Its GUI is very easy to use, start up in seconds. It has all the features you need and more. Very easy to configure.You will have a good signal even in a big house.And the most important thing very reliable, just plug it in and forget where it is.And the price is competitive.

647,XX,B0014J07R2,1,0,1,30-Aug-09,AX5EPK0DQP23Z,It'll fail on you,"This router was a bit of a pain to set up with the supposedly idiotproof Network Magic, but that may be because the printer on the network (a Canon MP620) is exceptionally difficult to network correctly.  Even so, once the PC was connected in by an Ethernet cable, the printer wirelessly, and two iMacs wirelessly, the pretty little network diagram the software created was perpetually inaccurate.  I don't think much of the Network Magic software.  Still, the router itself worked properly.  For a couple of months.  Then, the wireless connection started slowing down.  The iMac would be slow, unplugging the router and replugging would speed it up, and then it got to where it was permanently slow.  'Was' slow, because now it isn't working at all.  The Ethernet connection is fine, but not the wireless.  On the support forum, a number of people report this problem, and there isn't a clear solution.  The customer support guy on the phone never did grasp even what kind of computers we were using with the router.  And yes, I have updated the firmware and reset the thing.  No change.  I hate spending more money on another router, because this one should work.  But it doesn't.Later:Replaced the router by calling support, and they eventually gave up on trying to fix it by giving telephone advice, and authorized a return.  The replacement didn't work out of the box.  They went ahead and covered the return shipping for that one.  #3 has been working well now for several weeks.  We're keeping our fingers crossed.",,,

I haven't had to reset it once yet, and we get good reception all over the house and out on the deck.  The sleek look is somewhat entertaining, but in my opinion, the less I have to look at a router the better it's working.The setup was quite similar to my old D-link router, except for one thing, which took me about 10 minutes to figure out...  :)  The IP for the Linksys web interface is 192.168.1.1, not the 192.168.1.0 which I was used to from the D-link.  It took me so long because I had to go search around on the web to find this out, it was not anywhere in the instructions.Once found though, the web interface is pretty good.  It's more cleanly laid out than the old D-link one, but I would NOT say that it is particularly beginner friendly.  I have yet to see a wireless router interface that is beginner friendly, so if you are just starting, google around and read up before diving right in.  The most important thing to know (if you use a cable modem, like I do) is that you will need to forward the MAC-address of your computer's ethernet port to the router, so that the modem thinks the router is your computer.  The rest is a bit more obvious, WPA passwords, address-filtering, etc.So, good over-all product.  Hopefully it will last at least the 5 years that the old D-link did.",,,

On my old DLink router, I actually had to do some manual settings since according to tech support; it was 'not as compatible.' Anyways, this Linksys router was much easier to set up.

Neither running it on a Windows XP or Vista could finished the configuration. They said it was very easy to setup but it's not and the customer support are not that good either. But the equipment works great, once you figure out how to make it work. We had to go manually and configure it, and when we did no problem so far.",,,

Hook up was pretty easy and the provided software walked me through the whole process.  It took a little bit for the iTouch to log onto the network (we had to manually input all the network info into the iTouch before it would connect), but now it works just fine.  I would recommend this product.",,,
663,XX,B0014J07R2,5,0,0,14-Aug-09,A3HVZ4PD50TILX,Consistent connection - works great!,"Works well and works consistently. Have had trouble with other brands of wireless routers disconnecting computers frequently or just not allowing users to remain connected to the internet (usually fixed by unplugging for 30 seconds, but still annoying). Computers connecting wirelessly through this router include laptops and desktops using Windows XP and Vista.  Range for this router so far seems to be good - using it in our business (offices and showroom), we have a strong signal throughout.Straightforward setup and connection - though I would've preferred not to have used the included software. I removed the Network Magic software once the nag screen to purchase started popping up. That finally removed the icon it placed on the desktop that refused to be removed manually.",,,
664,XX,B0014J07R2,3,0,0,14-Aug-09,ANDQER6EUE6HP,"Router works well, but customer service is useless","When I installed this router, it would not finish the installation.  So I called customer service.  They were unable to help me finish the installation.  The router had installed it's own software over the shortcut I used to connect to my isp.  When I told them that their product had messed up my internet connection, they said 'that's not how it works'.I contacted my isp the next day, and they were able to help me get the router installed through a rather basic procedure.  Why the tech support people didn't know how to do this is beyond me.So, if you get this router, don't call their tech support.  If you have a problem, contact your isp, they probably know more about routers than the so called tech support people at this company.The router works well, and hasn't given me any trouble since it was installed.  I got it because it had no antennas, like some wireless routers do, since my cats tend to chew things like antennas.",,,

668,XX,B0014J07R2,5,0,0,10-Aug-09,A1LSK81LYJRBQT,Works as expected,"I bought this Linksys router after I got Road Runner Turbo.  I needed a router which could be mounted vertically in a structured wire cabinet in my basement.  My original NETGEAR router had a WAN port which maxed out at 10Mb/s, so the new router had to have a 100Base-T WAN port.  In summary, this router was easy to setup and I'm currently getting over 20 Mb/s wireless throughput on my internet connection.I also have an Apple router which delivers a wireless throughput to the internet of just over 30 Mb/s.  Unfortunately, it doesn't mount vertically (no screw holes), so I chose to use it as a WAP only, using the Linksys router as the gateway.  Surprisingly, if I hook up to the Linksys router with a wired connection, I still only get about 20 Mb/s throughput.  So the difference in performance between the Linksys and Apple routers seems to be related to how well they talk to my cable modem, not in how well my laptop communicates to the routers via my wireless connection.This router is physically smaller and lighter than I expected.  Again, setup was very simple.  Both my Mac and Windows laptops seem happy with their wireless connections, and the router has been stable since it was setup last week.  Considering the price paid, I currently regard this router as a good value, and would buy it again.",,,
669,XX,B0014J07R2,5,0,0,10-Aug-09,A25BAJ71LVNZGN,Completely satisfied!,"I purchased this router to replace a router that I was previously renting from my internet provider.  My only hesitation in buying from Amazon was the price.  It was $44.99 at Amazon, but $29.99 (recertified) at TigerDirect.  I purchased from Amazon primarily because I had an Amazon Rewards Certificate to redeem, making the final out-of-pocket price less than at TigerDirect.  I took advantage of the free shipping, even though it did delay my order a few days.In my home, the Linksys router works much better than the previous one.  I have had a wonderful experience with it so far.  Setup and connection were easy.  I can go anywhere in my home and still have a strong wireless signal.  I have experienced none of the problems that some of the other reviewers complained about.  I am completely satisfied with my purchase so far!",,,

I never had an issue with my old router.  I purchased this router after I moved out of my parent's home.  From day one, I have had nothing but issues with this router.  In the four days that I have owned this product, I have spent close to four hours on the phone with tech support.  Due to a couple power outages in my area, my router had to be configured about three times.  I never had to do this in the past with my old router.  I explained this to the Linksys technicians each time.  They didn't seem to understand that this was an inconvenience.  As a graduate student, I don't have the time or energy to spare on reconfiguring my router, each time there is a disruption in the modem connection.  I will be returning this items tomorrow and I will be purchasing another brand.",,,

672,XX,B0014J07R2,2,1,1,8-Aug-09,AJGZPHLPY90QF,The Worst Range EVER,"Not sure what happened here, but my new router worked at about 1/3 the distance my old WRT54GS works so into the box it went and back to Amazon (the best at customer service). I would not even spend the time calling Linksys to diagnose the problem. I installed the new update to the Router as per their notes, with no wireless devices active. Booted and re-booted the device and still, the worst signal we've ever had. I guess we'll leave the old router in place since it works so well with the wireless print server also from Linksys.",,,

674,XX,B0014J07R2,5,0,0,3-Aug-09,A3GIHPD5JA5H6L,No antenna but plenty of range,I bought this router to replace a 3 year old Netgear wireless router.  The Netgear was taking way too long to load pages even though it had been working well the first 3 years.  I replaced it with the Linksys WRT54G2 Wireless Router which works great in my application.  I get a strong signal on my MacBook Airport throughout my two story house.  I also like the automatic text file placed on the desktop with the password and network name that I established in the setup.  I did not have that feature on the Netgear.,,,
675,XX,B0014J07R2,1,5,6,29-Jul-09,A2MUUZR73W15AY,Problems from the start,"I just bought the router today and the thing does not work. I followed the installation procedures and I am having problems connecting with the internet with the router present.The installation was a snap but after the installation, I could not connect. I talked to Tech Support and they helped somewhat and I was treated well but the woman admitted to me that they are getting many calls about connection problems. She helped me connect my desktop but my laptop was not working wireless or with the network cable with no success. She said that I would have to go to level 2 support...Network settings can be difficult and I get really worried when tech support tells you to set the IP and Netmask addresses. How do they know it will not mess up your settings or conflict with other things? (My DSL connection uses DHCP and so the router should be able to use the same which was not happening)...I am an engineer and not a technical slouch... I am successful is diagnosing problems but the router should work as designed otherwise you have to configure every machine connection individually which is not how the router was designed.I did a second install which did not work either. This router is going back to Fry's; I do not know if the G version of this router is worth it or should I try another brand (it is hard to decide between the reviews that I read from the other vendors)...One more thing that I do not like with the router:There is a software package that is installed called Network Magic. This is basically useless software unless you get the Pro version... The idea of this software is that you can get information about network speed (in the Pro version) and whether you are connected to the network or not... You are given a limited trial period to the Pro software version... The installer does not allow you to chose whether or not to install this product (it would be a nice touch)...Update:I tried installing one more time and I was having nothing but trouble...I exchanged this router with a Netgear wgr614 v9 and it is now working. I had a few minor issues with the install (I will have a review soon for that router), but it is working with my desktop.I updated the wireless card on my Laptop with a new Netgear wireless G card and I am having no issues with seeing my network. I entered my WEP password and it is working great...I was also able to share files on my desktop to copy to the laptop with copying the files first to a flash device and then connecting the flash device to the laptop; to much hassle to do... I also updated the Trend Micro Firewall wireless and it has been a pleasure to have a working router...I was able to go into the living room and surf wireless on my laptop which was great...",,,
676,XX,B0014J07R2,1,2,2,28-Jul-09,A1SBMN3AQJY715,The worst tech. support ever encountered.,"I purchased the WRT54G2 and followed the instructions to the letter. The install was straight forward and I encountered no problems. When finished, the instructional cd informed me that the installation was successful. When I attempted to use my laptop on the wireless network, it would not connect. I eventually contacted tech. support. BIG MISTAKE. After an hour of following numerous changes to the network settings I was told that it must be my computer. My laptop is what I use at work, & it works flawlessly every day in a wireless setup. However, I was told to go to work and try again. The laptop worked fine at work. So I called again today, after another hour, I was told that BOTH my laptop & desktop were broken & that I needed to get them fixed before the Linksys router would work. I told the tech that both computers were worked perfectly before the 2 hours of changes & that Linksys is responsible for the network problems that I now have. I was put on hold to talk to a supervisor. After 38 minutes of music, I hung up & have sent the Linksys back to Amazon. I have been using computer related equipment for over 25 years. I have never encountered such useless & counter productive advice. The Linksys tech support makes HP support seem like Apple Care!",,,
677,XX,B0014J07R2,5,0,0,28-Jul-09,A15CL28ALB7MTZ,Great router though the range isn't as good as it could be,"The router works great.  I had previously been using a Netgear WGR614 router (which was still 54mbs and wireless g enabled).  The Netgear router kept dropping the connection and seemed like it was overheating.I purchased the Linksys router and like it for the following reasons:1. Looks much more sleek2. The Internet seems faster and more responsive3. My Vista machine gains back its connection much more quickly when coming out of sleep or hibernation4. No more dropped connections5. Option for https configuration6. Has WPA27. Tried out the connection and the WPA2 works with the Wii, and the G1 Android phone.  Ooma worked fine through the wired plugin.Things that could use some improvement:1. I don't like it when you have to install software for peripherals and accessories.  I installed the software, and will uninstall it because I can get to the advanced settings directly through the router interface.2. I checked the signal strength in different parts of the house before I disconnected my old router and then after connecting the Linksys router.  Where I received Very Good with the old router, the Linksys router only gives Fair to Good connection strength.",,,

It lasted 4 years, so I was happy with the purchase. Anyhow, I went to BB because I did not want to wait for a unit to ship. I purchased this unit and it would not work. (There were no Dlink items in stock) I spent about an hour with 'customer service' and they said it was unable to work because of our network. We have Comcast and I had already contacted them and was certain it was not their issue, as we have cable and phone service and both were fine. I returned the unit to BB and purchased a Netgear router. It was easy to setup and has been great. It is less expensive as well.",,,
680,XX,B0014J07R2,4,1,1,26-Jul-09,AF4KGF299SDO3,cycle power after installation,"I had no problem installing this, but then initially was very disappointed.  Ethernet connection to my laptop (MacBook Pro) was slow when running through the router.  When I connected cable modem directly to my laptop, connection was fine so it wasn't cable service.  Wireless device (iTouch) was also slow.  I had a faster connection from my neighbor's service! So, I tried the power down cycle -- turning off computer, modem and router and then re-powering them in this order: modem, router, laptop.  Made all the difference in the world.  Maybe this should be considered the final step in installation for this.",,,
681,XX,B0014J07R2,5,0,0,24-Jul-09,A2ZI7MNXPV97GC,excellent value for the pricing,"The sleek looks of this router did it for me. Of course there are the 802.11n (draft) routers on the market as well, but they are double the price of these 802.11g routers. The 802.11g already outputs 54 Mbps, so going for an 802.11n router can be justified only if you are going do some seriously high end gaming, video streaming and that to over multiple stations. If primary purpose is online streaming, browsing, mails, ssh sessions with probably 2 to 3 laptops this will more than suffice. Moreover, the bottleneck are not the wireless access points, the bottleneck is you broadband internet connectivity, which is much lower than what the access point gives.A range is another factor in consideration; the 802.11n due to MIMO are supposed to give better range. But again the range is justified only in a multi-storeyed apartment or a huge house. In a 1-2 bedroom condo there is no point. So all said and done, if you are in an apartment and want to have 2-3 laptops/PC to connect to the net this is definitely it.",,,

Recently, it started losing communication with cable modem and now it does almost everyday. I did basic trouble shooting by unpluggin power of two devices and plug them again. It did not work at all, so I called tech support to get help. I followed their instruction but still did not get it done. They said they could connect my computer by remote access but would be charged.I was upset but did not have any choises so I said, 'Go adead.'. The first tech representative spent four hours but did not make it work and she hung up the phone and never called me back. What a service!

Considering that this product does not do what it is designed to do, I think ZERO would be more appropriate.  Setup wasn't too problematic.  It comes with proprietary software that needs to be installed and which runs in the system tray, which is irritating, but not deal-breaking.  Once I got it set up, it seemed to work great.  I had my friend and cousin over so we could add their MAC adresses to the wireless filter, but once we had that set up, they both complained about the connection being slow.  After that, I started having nothing but problems.It works fine as a wired router most of the time.  But if I wanted a wired router, I would have spent $20 for a wired router instead of $50 for a wireless.  I have unplugged, reset the router, and re-installed the software on my laptop, but so far, nothing has worked.  I am stuck having to constantly connect and reconnect cables to get my stuff online.  The wireless simply doesn't work.  My laptop detects the router, but whenever I try to connect, nothing happens.  No error message, nothing.  It just sits there and my computer cannot connect to the internet.  As much as I want to blame the cable company's crappy internet service, I know that isn't the problem.  ANy time i'm connected directly to the modem, everything works perfectly, but once I try to go through the router, everything goes to hell.I do NOT recommend this router at all.

This made my total purchase much more expensive than the combination units.It took several hours to configure both the modem and router.  It kept asking me to press a button on the unit, and nothing was working, so I restarted the computer, and finally it accepted it.I wouldn't say anything is wrong with the device, but the several hours of set-up kind of made this piece of technology a pain in the a$$, and the fact that a separate modem is required made the price a lot more expensive.",,,

The router just stopped working in any wireless mode whether there's security or not. I updated firmware, restarted router and multiple PCs many times but failed to get it tow work. Linksys support would not make any exception on RMA even though it's clearly their product quality. If they don't put their name behind their products, I may as well buy a cheap $[...] after rebate Trendnet or lower priced Netgear or Dlink. BTW, my Trendnet actually lasted me quite some time.

715,XX,B0014J07R2,5,2,2,29-Jun-09,A62PX3VWOJ0QG,"Easy Setup, Reliable, Good Range","I've been using a NetGear Rangemax for a number of years now - my house has sound dampening insulation in the walls, and that seems to impact range with most routers.When I got the NetGear, it was purely for range... and the RangeMax does deliver on that promise. However now and then I'd have to unplug it to do a hard reset because it's connection with the cable modem would get funky and it wouldn't connect. Or often I'd have to http to the web admin to release/renew the IP from the cable modem. I assumed this was more of a Comcast issue.But a few months ago I got a Macbook Pro, and life with NetGear went downhill. Hitting any sort of site with video, or downloading a large file caused the router to totally lock up. And it got to the point where I couldn't take it anymore.So I decided to give the Linksys WRT54G2 a try. What I find confusing about the Linksys WRT series routers is just the naming conventions... there's so many, it's hard to discern what a higher model adds, and reviews seem to fluctuate. E.g. often the lower end Linksys routers seem to score better than the higher end.But the WRT54G2 at Amazon has 300+ 5/5 ratings, so figured it was a safe bet.Setup was a breeze, 5 minutes and was up and running. Range is as good if not better than the MIMO based NetGear RangeMax (I believe the WRT54G2 is MIMO as well). Haven't had to release/renew the IP from Comcast like I've had to do with the NetGear.Absolutely no problems with the Macbook, and no impact with XBOX Live gaming (I play Call Of Duty 4 and 5 online). I also run Windows Vista and Windows XP boxes on the network.I used to be a big fan of NetGear, but if you go on their hosted discussion forums - there's tons of people asking how to solve this Macbook locking up the router issue as it spans many of their products. It's very dissapointing to see that they haven't updated the router's firmware (for the RangeMax, there hasn't been an update since 2006).",,,

No problems getting it setup and worked fine with a wired connection. I didn't like the fact that it tried to install software called Network Magic to manage my wireless connections. I probably could have gone straight to a manual setup and skipped the installation CD. My problem with this router was that I was unable to get a wireless connection working, despite over 30 minutes of fiddling and testing. I tried to get it to work with WPA, WEP and even no security. The computer kept saying I did not have a certificate for this connection. In over six years of setting up wireless connection, I have never gotten this message. I decided to send this back and get a different brand router instead of dealing with tech support.

It was super easy to install and set up.  It has worked great for us so far.  We mainly use it for our iPod and Wii.,,,
759,XX,B0014J07R2,3,2,2,16-May-09,ADLVFFE4VBT8,"Easy setup, near trouble-free operation. DNS issue update (downgraded for Cisco's horrible customer support)","I ordered the WRT54G2 'refurbished' because I wanted a replacement for my 801.11b Linksys and the refurbished could be had for a significantly lower price (kudos to Electronica Direct) and the product was Linksys certified and came with a 90-day warranty. To my surprise - I expected some glitches - I had close to zero problem installing and operating it. Here is my experience.- I followed the advice to first run the installation off the provided CD.- Even though all of my computers are wireless, I followed the advice and connected one of my computer to the router via Ethernet to perform the initial installation.- After disconnecting the old 801.11b router I used the exact same name for the new network. This allowed for all devices to connect immediately, as soon as the setup completed.- I made sure that the DHCP server was on.- The end of setup. All devices, including the wireless printer and the VOIP box connected without a problem.To my surprise, LELA is not on the CD. It took me longer to find, download and install LELA (Linksys EasyLink Advisor) that to complete the initial setup. I strongly recommend that you do install LELA because, besides the nice graphic of your home network it allows you to restore broken connections without having to turn off the router.As far as performance is concerned, I believe that I notice a slight but not significant improvement over my old 801.11b router. We have about one dozen connected devices: desktops, laptops, a PS3, a PSP, VOIP, printer and, with all on, everything worked just fine. With the router in the basement, I had '3-bars' on a computer 15-20 feet from the router. Surprisingly, I had 3 bars on the first and on the second floor as well and I had the same 3 bars outside, about 90 feet from the router, by the pool. The old router gave me 4 bars in the basement but only 3 bars in the rest of the house and only 1 or 2 bars with intermittent disconnections outside the house.With LELA running, I was able to quickly fix the 2-3 disconnections that occurred over a 3-day period without having to power off the router. This was better than my old 801.11b that had me power off the cable modem and the router whenever the connection to the Internet stopped working.Overall, I am very happy with my new router so far. It's probably as good as any 801.11g device can get.___________________________________________DNS issues update:With DHCP, strangely, after a few months of operation, the router began to 'forget' about passing DNS queries to the outside server. It KNOWS about the 3 DNS servers the ISP has but, out of the blue I get 'resolving host' errors and LELA claims that I'm no longer connected to the Internet. This while VoIP, connected to the same router works without a problem and so do the PS3 and my kids computers.The initial 'solution' was to power off the router and then power it back on.I have no idea why this was happening yet but, this is my quick solution: on the 'Network and Sharing Center' click on your connection 'View status' then 'Properties', highlight 'Internet Protocol Version 4...', 'Properties', 'Advanced', from the DNS tab click on 'Add...' and enter all the DNS servers that your router has listed under 'Status'.This eliminated all problems._________________________________________________Update July 3, 2013One star goes off for the horrible customer service. After spending over an hour, being moved back and forth from 'customer support' to 'tech support' and back, Cisco decided they would NOT sell me a replacement power adapter (original had been destroyed in an electrical storm) because my unit was out of warranty. This is NOT the way to keep your customers happy or keep your customers at all. Apparently, Cisco believes that, at least when it comes to 'home' products, their customers are on their own once the warranty expires.Way to go Cisco but, wherever you're going, I'm no longer with you.",,,

Although you do not need it, the installation CD gives you baby step instructions so you set up your router correctly. Good for not coputer friendly users. The lack of antenna makes the unit look good but as I have noticed, not so good for the performance of the wireless feature. I had used several other antenna dotted routers and by far, this is the slower one with the samespeed source. I have been monitoring it for different times of the day to avoid jumping into conclusion and avoid misinterpretation due to rush hours activities. The wireless function is really slow. When I need to speed it up, I plug in a network cable. Believe me, you will notice the diffenrence in speed right away. It is somehow disappointing coming from such good manufacturer but I guess they focussed this design into easy of use and the look. This is an OK product.

He decided to take control over my computer and this cost an additional 9.99. I needed wirelss immediately so had no choice but it is so wrong to charge people.

First off, the software CD provided with the router kept getting an 'internal error.' After 2 tech support calls totalling about 5 hours we finally got it to work, albeit poorly. Extremely weak signal - wireless laptops must be within 6 feet of the router to get 'good' signal.  No signal at all beyond about 12 feet.  Two more calls to tech support about this, and I finally agreed to pay Linksys an additional $10.00 to remotely fix my problem, but to no avail.  This remote session lasted about 3 more hours, at the end of which they announced that they had 'isolated the problem' - the walls of my house!!! My old router provided adequate signal throught my modest 1800 sq ft house. They ended up suggesting that I just return this new router to the store for a refund.

I tried connecting a PlayStation 3 about 40 feet away from the router with minimal obstruction, and it could never stay connected for more than 30 minutes before getting dropped. I then moved it about 15 feet away from the router and I'm still getting dropped regularly.The worst thing about this router is that even the wired connection somehow manages to suck. Even with my computer directly connected to the router, I STILL got dropped all the time and I have to either reset the router or just wait for it to work again and both problems are extremely annoying.

777,XX,B0014J07R2,4,0,0,4-May-09,ASIEZ3IGEYJ16,Great except for it's DHCP server.,"This G wireless router is all I need for my house.  Covers the whole house and patio/deck in back yard well (I don't care about coverage beyond that).  The speed is much faster than my cable modem, so a faster (N protocol) router would not really help much.My only complaint is the DHCP server.  On my old wireless B Netgear router, I could go into the router configuration web page and tell it to always give a certain MAC address the same IP address via DHCP.  That was nice because I could just set the machine to use DHCP to keep up with any changes, such as DNS servers, that my ISP makes.  I could then set up simple host files to map host names to a fixed IP, which for file transfers, printing, etc... makes things easier.  This router does NOT have this simple feature.  Linux can be configured to use a static IP, but still get the DNS from DHCP.  For Red Hat based systems, look at /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0.  The graphical network configuration tool does not have that option, but it can be set using the configuration file.  Windows can not, at least that I could see, be configured to do that.  For Windows, I guess the best bet is to use DHCP and set host name resolution to use wins, but that does not work for everything.  A laptop computer that goes between work and home really needs to use DHCP.  For printers, the IP must be set from the buttons on the printer.  Anyway, there are some ways to work around it, but it would have been so much simpler if they just had a mechanism in the router to always give each machine the same IP address from the DHCP server.Perhaps if the fine folks Linksys / Cisco have some specific recommendations to this problem, they should share them.  I spent several hours searching the Internet for solutions.  There are lots of people complaining about this in the online forums, but few solution and nothing on any Linksys / Cisco web page that addresses this basic problem.  Are their heads in the sand on this?  I'm no marketing expert, but I'd think that if they want to sale these routers that they should post solutions to known short comings rather than ignoring the fact that the router does not have a feature that customers need.",,,

The strength of the Belkin connection had been about 3- 4 (5 being max on my computer).  I work on an H-P 530 notebook, about 50' from the router. My service is Charter high-speed cable in Los Angeles.I wanted a faster and stronger router.  This Linksys router has given me a signal strength  of 3 max, and less during peak hours.  It  has dropped the signal  about three times in six days, during  routine web surfing and  streaming video. I'm considering returning it.INSTALLATIONThe router was installed about a week  ago.  Installation was so mixed up that it stretched over an evening and a morning.Using the included installation CD, there were times when I was unsure about which options to select, with the result that I repeated some of the install steps.  There are install  icons but very little text.  I'm no expert (nor are most consumers), so I need things to be clear. They were not clear to me.During install there was a message to the effect of 'configuring computer, please wait,'  along with a spinning circle.  Well, I waited for a couple of hours, as the screen does not give any indication of how long I should wait. It was my first router install, so I had no experience with  a normal process.Circle still spinning, I finally went to bed and sometime during the night configuration was finished. Since the 'manual' is on the CD, and I was in a holding pattern with that screen, there was no way to double-check the configuration steps.In my view, this is a BIG drawback.  Cisco, improve the CD or include written instructions.APPEARANCEThe router is sleek and compact, with internal antennas.  The lights/symbols  on this router are easy to understand and perfectly mimic the lights on my modem..Packaging is clean and appealing, but the router specifications are mentioned only in very tiny print on the side of the box.  This makes it difficult to comparison shop.. Comparable brand boxes are much clearer.IMHOThe router is OK but not necessarily a substantial upgrade.  Installation is evidently not hard for some people, but can be confusing.In many cases, size, shape and speed of the router may be an improvement, and reception may be much better at closer range. Operative term is 'may be.'Would only recommend to a friend who has a pretty old router and can be satisfied by modest improvement, modest cost..",,,

I particularly like that you can set the max number of connections.However, as other reviewers have mentioned, it loses its DHCP settings and the only way to fix it is to power-cycle (turn off your router and cable/DSL modem, and turn them back on one at a time). Most recently, though, that didn't even work for my parents. Rather than try to fix it, I just bought a Netgear router after recommending Linksys for over 10 years.I have the same Linksys unit with the same problems. It doesn't happen as often with the latest drivers, but it still happens once in a while and I wasn't able to fix my parents' unit in short order.

The software it comes with it is so easy and if you are stumped you can call the Cisco dept for further assistance. Its old now and not in warranty anymore but guess what? Cisco still supports it with their great technical assistance team. But one downfall is that, once you get more and more with the devices.Often, it gets slow, very slow on the desktop, but I seldom use my desktop anyway. Sometimes I have to go on my desktop and repair the connection but that is minor because its apart of maintenance anyway just like an antivirus software detecting vicious malware. One of the positive features that I like about this device is the lights are on the front so it is easy to detect something as opposed to the later and newer ones where you have to flip it around to see what the lights are doing. This is good now for the use of the laptops and the netbooks if you want something to get them going'Lastly, the coverage gives a great range of coverage. My house is 2120 sq ft.- the house alone- and I can go anywhere in the house and the signal is still strong.So A+ on the range and the speed is good too.",,,

When I first switched from wired to wireless (a WRT54GL) about four years ago, I started noticing a need to constantly reset the router - the internet connection seemed to go out, sometimes 3-4 times/day.  I chalked that up to the price I had to pay for the convenience of wireless.  Eventually the performance of the internet deteriorated even on the wired connections.  I decided to take a gamble and buy the WRT54G2 to see if that would improve performance.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  Setup required my calling Linksys (the included setup disk instruction did NOT work with my eMac and Comcast ISP), but once set up the connection stability and speed have improved dramatically.  I wish I had done this months ago.  Now that I've used the WRT54G2, if I were rating the WRT54GL I'd give it maybe two stars, based on my experience.",,,

Then I bought it and expected its excellent performance. However, it really disappointed me. So I had to return it.First, installation from CD was painful although it is recommended in the description of the product. It was very slow, and some error message came up in the last step. I tried twice and met the same situation. It looked that the installation was incomplete, but that was not the case. The internet connection was actually set up already. What's more, the linksys easylink advisor(LELA) was a nightmare to me. If you would like use it to configure your wireless network, you would just waste your time. I always failed to set up wireless network using LELA, and it would prevent other softwares (like windows wireless network connection and thinkpad access)from configuring your wireless network. Finally, I had to uninstall the LELA to set up the wireless connection. After that, I found the CD was almost useless because you can easily initialize the router by going to [...] and specifying all parameters. There is a detailed instruction on the website of linksys.Second, the wireless connection was unstable. It seems that you need to wait several minutes for the stabilizing. Although the signal is very strong, but the repeating connect-unconnect cycles were really unbearable. Furthermore, it would be interrupted suddenly and I had to reboot the router to let it work again.

I could not be more happy with this product's performance. The signal strength is absolutely incredible. We have a fairly large house and I can get 54 Mbps on the farthest point in the house from the router. TIP: For maximum signal strength and quality all through your house, place the router in your basement. Then the signal just shoots upward. This is also great for security because the Wi-Fi signal is weaker when you have peeking neighbors who are trying to invade your network.This router is loaded with tons of great features. Firstly, LELA (Linksys Easy Link Advisor) is truly amazing for beginners. However, if you are more technically inclined, I would strongly recommend using the Web-based configuration tool. For best security purposes, use WPA2 (TKIP+AES) as your security level(Under the 'Wireless' tab on the page). Then set the configuration page to use HTTPS (on the 'Administration' tab).

I bought this new WRT54G2 for my in-laws, and thought I would go through the exercise of installing it in my house to make sure it works, and to leanr more about it.The software install script failed 3 times.  On the third time it failed even though it successfully established internet connectivity for the router.  This is with BellSouth (now AT&T) FastAccess DSL 6Mb with Motorola modem.  This is very disappointing.  How are people who are not familiar with wireless networking concepts going to use this product if it fails on such an easy install with such a popular provider?I had much better luck resetting the modem and then not running the software install all, but instead using the IP 192.168.1.1 to manage the router manually.  Had it working in 3 minutes that way.Once it was up and going, the management was identical to the old WRT54G I have.One test I do with routers is to connect wirelessly with my work laptop, establish a VPN connection, and then see how long it stays up.  With my old WRT54G it will stay up for days...maybe forever.  Unfortunately the WRT54G2 is not nearly as successful.  With my laptop 5 feet away from the router, it has already dumped my VPN connection 3 times in the first hour.  All it takes is a little blip in wireless connectivity and the VPN connection drops.  People who don't VPN into work from home won't even know it's happening.This router will be fine for my in-laws because I know what I'm doing when it comes to wireless networking so I'll be able to configure it, and they don't VPN anything.  For those of you who are not very wireless networking literate, or rely on VPN from home to do your job, I would steer you clear of this router.  Maybe a future firmware update will make it more stable, but for now its a frustration waiting to happen.",,,

I had a cable modem already wire-connected to my desktop and wanted a wireless connection to my laptop. The setup was super easy.  Four items came in the box; the router, the power cable, the connecting cable and the manual/CD.  I followed the instructions as stated in the manual and had it running in about 10 minutes!  I've had this for about a month now and have not noticed any problems.  The router is set up in one of the bedrooms and I've used the laptop in the garage with no problems.  A techie gave me the advice to keep the interconnecting doors of the house open for better reception...I'm not sure if this holds true, but I'd recommend trying it for anyone having problems.  I consider myself a step up from a novice user but would recommend this product for everyone.  The price was very reasonable too.",,,

I liked it because it was just one device, not two, and because Comcast set it up for me.  I avoid computer hookups because I know just enough to mess everything up, so basically I know very little.Well Comcast no longer provides the dual modem/router as it is dated, so I had Comcast replace the modem (which provides just a cable connected internet service to one computer) but I still needed a router (to provide wifi) for my laptop computer and Nintendo Wii.After reading the reviews on the WRT54G2, I took a chance and bought one.  It is perfect.  There are literally four steps to hook it up with easy to follow pictures, and within 15 minutes I had Wifi up and working.So if you need WiFi but are techinically inept like me, have faith in this product, you can set it up.  I'm pretty sure my mom could set this up, and that is saying something.  Oh and as far as connection speed goes, this is plenty fast.",,,

For some of you,  those of you like me, it is helpful to note that I am NOT computer savvy AT ALL. I use my computer to email, surf the web, shop and update my blog- other than that I am pretty clueless. I recently bought a used Mac to edit and make home videos and wanted to go wireless. The router that I purchased needed to be easy to set up, have a good range, work with my Mac/PC/Wii and most importantly be with in my budget. After doing some research and reading the reviews I decided that the Linksys WRT54G2 was the best option for me,  mostly because of the price AND I kept reading that it was uber easy to set up. I had planned on ordering the router from Amazon but  while I was in Target today I saw it for only $5.00 more than the Amazon price and since I was pretty doubtful that I was going to be successful, the idea that I could return it locally seemed pretty appealing. I came home and anticipating a hassle (I really am a computer idiot)  I waited  to install it until after I put my kids down for a nap. When the time came I simply popped the start up disc in and followed the directions- five minutes later my PC and my Mac were both online. No problems. No tech calls. RIght now I am about 30 ft from the router and getting a full signal. As for getting kicked off- I have only been online for and hour or two so I have no problems with that. Since reading most of the reviews that included fancy computer lingo was like reading a foreign language, I really can not dispute anyone else's problems. I do know that for me this has been a great purchase. In fact after I installed it I called my husband to brag that I did it all on my own- he too was doubtful. I am rating it 4 stars only because I have not been online long enough to see if it boots me off- only time will tell.....",,,

It didnt slow down the internet at all and the best part of all is that neighbors can't steal my internet because you can lock the router. It arrived sooner than expected as well.

What an improvement in speed and reliability! The old router would drop the wifi connection every week or so. Not so with this router. It never dropped wifi connection even once! (Although I do reboot the router every few weeks due to a force of habit).My router has been running since September 2008 and so far everything is smooth with absolutely no complaints.NOTE:After updating the firmware from v1.0.01 to v1.0.02 (dated 01/07/2009, available in the Linksys' website), there was a *very* noticeable improvement in speed of website access. (For example, Amazon's webpage loads much quicker). However, based on benchmark tests I tried, there was no performance increase with overall download speed. (For example, FTP of a large file takes the same time as before).This tells me that the new firmware fixes some performance issues related to routing/translating network addresses, although there is no mention of this in the firmware release notes.If you decide to upgrade your firmware, remember to backup your settings (located in the router admin webpage under Admin->Config Management). After upgrading, reset the router to factory defaults (through the webpage or the reset button)and then restore your backed up settings.",,,

Pick something unique so when your laptop searches for the access point signal, you know which wireless signal to use.)I am very happy with this router.",,,

903,XX,B0014J07R2,5,0,0,19-Feb-09,A2KJN6XUEP2NFW,Great product - works flawlessly,I purchased since it was cheap and new $49.  Not disappointed in the least.  So far have seamlessly and wirelessly attached 3 computers and one printer.  Each computer took two minutes once I knew how to do it.

This unit was a dream to install, so easy and quick(I second the 5 minute install time of another reviewer) that I have recommended it to friends looking to add wireless. Range and speed are more than adequate going through 60' of floor space and two floors yet still providing good speed. Still to come--how long it will last. Now every time I restart my desk top or laptop the darn thing does not need rebooting the whole system. O yes- printers work thru this for the first time for me.",,,

The Linksys streamed Media content from my laptop to my son's XBox better than the TP-Link, but wouldn't reach to our bedroom, about 40' and two brick walls away. So the Linksys is headng to the office, and the TP-Link (old, but with an external aerial) is coming home.It looks nice, and works well if you don't need the range.

However I needed more security and wanted to setup up some IP cameras to watch my puppies while I was away.  Setup was easy but it never stayed that way.  Every problem I had was with the way the router would completely lose its configuration and go back to factory defaults.  Even the admin password would go back to default!I tried upgrading the firmware but ended up bricking the router.  I tried all the other options to bring it back to life.  Even tore it open and shorted pins 16 and 17 on the flash chip while the computer was constantly pinging it.  None of that worked.  Oh well it was already way out of warranty anyway.  The forums do say that this particular version is susceptible to power loss/intermittent issues.  So the suggestions where to have it on UPS.I'm off to get an Airport Extreme base station now.  Its overpriced but I like having the capability of streaming music to anywhere in the house using the audio jack built into the Express plug routers.",,,
912,XX,B0014J07R2,4,1,1,15-Dec-11,A20L63B48RPSOH,Low price router,"I purchased this router over 2 years ago after the previous router decided to go on a strike. It has served me well, however now it is time to move up a bit in technology, so I have purchased Belkin's 650 to replace. Since owning the router for 2 years, I have had to reset it twice. I now have several wireless devices and have found that this older router just cannot keep up with my demands. I have 9 wireless devices, plus a wireless printer and since initiating the last 2 (a Pogoplug and a Vulkano) I have noticed the wireless speed dropping significantly. To use my Vulkano I really need a bit more oomph although in this router's defence it does do the job, but only to a bare minimum. I also had computers hooked 24/7 to this router and never experienced any of the drop issues others have complained about. Maybe I'm just lucky.For a simple wireless setup this little Linksys served me very well. Now that I am concerned about speed, I'm wanting one of the higher priced routers. But I wholeheartedly recommend this gadget if you just need a reliable router to handle a couple laptops or gaming systems. If you can pick it up cheap, you probably would be happy. This is old technology and you should not pay through the nose for it. Also, there are some Belkins out there that are good in price and can do the job faster. The 300, for instance. I was surprised this Linksys was even still listed on Amazon and certainly would pay CLOSE attention to the prices currently being asked for this router.",,,

914,XX,B0014J07R2,1,2,2,1-Dec-11,A1GSUOW4JJL4TP,Awful,This is a terrible piece of technology. It cruelly drops connections at the worst possible times. Printing a multi-page document to your wireless printer? BAM. Drops the connection. Skyping? No way. About to win a game of Age of Empires III? Forget it. This router is a piece of crap. It drops the connection far more than any functional router should. I have to reset it at least once a week. Avoid this router at all costs.,,,

Its a cheap router where I have 5 wireless devices connected to it. I had the old WRT54G router (blue/black) and now my son uses that in college.

Then browse to another.  Then you're done.  Out of the chair, find the slippers, go down to the office and reset the router again.  It will work fine for 2-4 more weeks, then you have to reset it again.  Seems related to using WEP protection.  No firmware upgrades are available.

Problems began when the setup software gave me the wrong instructions: it told me to replace my existing modem vs. add on to it.  Since it gave me the wrong instructions I ended up having to call tech support, and since it was past the year warranty I had to pay $30 for tech support. They tried to convince me to buy a new router instead, so I could get the one year of free tech support.  Since the item is brand new I decided to just pay the $30 for tech support.  It was about an hour of back and forth to get this thing installed.  Then I simply wanted to change the password so I called back and that was another hour on the phone.  They told me this devise is obsolete and I should buy a new one.  This is a brand new, never been used device.  If it's obsolete, why is it still being sold online?  They are clearly trying to make you buy more.  I hope there are other options out there for next time.",,,

It set up in seconds on my Mac (no installation CD needed for Macs, just type the address of the router into your browser and start configuring, but it would be nice if the instructions mentioned this.) However, it went suddenly, unexpectedly dead right in the middle of uploading some time-sensitive business stuff.  I discovered the power adapter burnt out and looking around online I can see no readily available replacements.  So the router is an excellent value but I suggest turning it off (maybe unplugging)unless you're actually online, which is a PITA but probably necessary. :/",,,

926,XX,B0014J07R2,5,0,0,6-Feb-09,A2PNOU7NXB1JE4,Wireless Netflix streaming at last!,"When I initially contacted Linksys the tech person suggested this as their best model for my specific needs. I bought this so I could stream Netflix from my LG BD 300 Blu Ray (which I LOVE). It was easy to set up and works great. I did have to call Linksys 3 times when the WGA600N adapter failed to load properly. The first call to Linksys was WONDERFUL and temporarily things were running smoothly. Then my DVD player couldn't connect for software updates or Netflix. The 2nd support person spent 10 minutes trying to convince me to pay $9.99 for her to remotely set up the adapter, which the first person NEVER mentioned paying-so I quickly ended that call. The 3rd person was WONDERFUL just like the 1st person had been and NEVER mentioned me paying for her support. Now everything is working perfectly and I am VERY pleased w/ all 3 products. This router is very sleek and has a modern attractiveness. I really like that it has an internal antenna. My old Links wired router had the antennas so you had to allow for more room, although I liked its metal gray color equally as well as this black one. If anything goes wrong, I'll add an addendum. I'll be happily streaming away over the weekend.",,,

While our existing WRT54G and GL routers were a breeze to install, we had a lot of trouble getting the laptops to work with it. We set this one back and purchased a Linksys WRT54GL version instead.

928,XX,B0014J07R2,4,0,0,6-Feb-09,A1ADR7KJFEW8TN,Satisfying product,"I bought the router months ago because my very old D-Link router drops the connections from time to time. This Linksys WRT54G2 model is very light and good-looking. The power supply can be 110V-240V, which means it can be used all over the world. I use the router to connect my 3 thinkpad laptops at home. The wireless connection breaks occasionally with my R40e laptop. For the other two better machines, the connections are pretty stable. The wireless speed is what I expected. The configuration is easy after browsing the PDF manual.Some users complain that they can never finish the setup procedure successfully. At the beginning I also met some trouble in running the setup wizard. Then I figure out the reason. The key is that, before running setup wizard, you have to make sure that your computer has been connected to your modem successfully. Then everything will become very simple. If this is the reason for most unsuccessful setup, maybe they should put it onto the brochure.Linksys WRT54G2 is a satisfying router.",,,

Also able to surf from my backyard almost 100 ft away from the router and through three walls and a deck which means the range is great too.Only drawback I notice (I've had the unit for a couple weeks now) is the amount of space it takes up on the desk.  It's not a model you can stand up on a base and requires a 6x8' space on the desk (not including the room needed for the cable coming out the back).  I don't believe it can be wall mounted.  Good news is that there's no antenna sticking up from the thing and since it's maybe an inch high it's pretty unnoticeable if it's installed a waist level or above.All in all a great router and I'd purchase again.",,,

945,XX,B0014J07R2,5,1,1,24-Jan-09,A2SD1Z4OROY538,Converted to the WRT54G2 from a Netgear MR814V2,"I recently replaced my Netgear MR814V2 (802.11b) with the WRT54G2.  Even though I am reluctant in a bad economy to replace a functional piece of equipment, it seemed too slow, especially after recently getting an iPod Touch (802.11g).  Indeed, once I purchased the WRT54G2 my wireless performance to my Touch, wireless laptop, and Wii improved significantly.In addition to the improved performance, this router also has improved MAC address filtering.  Because of circumstances I am unable to rely on password encryption so I instead rely on MAC address filtering, which means unless you have a specified identifier in the router, you can't gain a connection.  The old router only allowed 4 devices under this method, so if someone came to visit who needed wireless, I had to delete an existing device to give them access.  No problem with this router - it allows at least 20 devices access under this access method.  No need to fight with passwords either!In terms of the setup, it's plug and play.  For the 'Dummies' crowd the software walks you step by step the sequence of connections.  You probably don't need to do this if you're experienced but I did it through an 'abundance of caution.'  Everything worked great!  I didn't set up passwords but it looked like the software would have walked me through that too, which is great.I liked the footprint, even though it ended up being larger than the old device.  I have a cramped wiring box for my phone, cable, and internet, but this fit fine.  Not having the antenna (or its optimal orientation) to worry about is an added bonus and I have seen no relative degradation by placing the metal lid over the wiring box.Overall I am happy with the device, although I think the price is a bit high.  My Touch wireless is functional and updates to the Wii software don't take years anymore!  Many of the improvements listed here may be standard, I don't know.  But they have made replacing my nearly 6-year-old router worth it.",,,

I have 10 meg cable modem service and usually test 9-10 meg download speeds during quiet times on the internet, ethernet cable and wireless.  When I connected this router into the circuit my download speeds dropped to between 4-5 meg max.  After working with Linksys (who had good customer service but wasn't able to fix the trouble), I discovered that when my router and cable modem (Ambit model U10C018-80) were setting next to each other they appeared to be interfering with one another.  When I moved the modem about one foot below where my router was setting my download speeds jumped back up to their 9-10 meg range.

The reviews for the Netgear router comparable to this Linksys WRT54G2 were a little scary.  So we decided to try a Linksys router this time.Installation was easy and the product works well.  My 16-year-old son did the job for us, and did it well.  The CD installation software that comes with the router is for beginners.  If you have had experience working with routers, you will want to just dive in and do it yourself.  Much quicker.  Even my inexperienced son found the installation software took too long to do simple things.When using the router settings page to adjust settings, I liked the Netgear approach better.  This Linksys router settings page leaves a little bit to be desired.  I still have not found how to list what wireless devices are currently connected to the router.  Is it even possible?  If not, that's a flaw that will bother me.Finally, like some other reviewers, I like the vertical style router like Netgear rather than this horizontal style.  My Netgear router looked good.  This Linksys router takes up space and looks kind of stupid.  Function is more important than style, of course.  But still.If we have any problems with this router, I'll update my comments.  So far we are satisfied with it, both for what we got and what we paid for it.",,,

So far the WRT54G2 has proven as fast or faster than its predecessor and much more reliable, so the unusual new design doesn't seem to have impaired it any.  Range may even have improved slightly.  The old router would occasionally choke after heavy use by wireless clients or stop leasing addresses, but this one works flawlessly 24/7.  I've had as many as 8 wireless clients running simultaneously without issues.  XBox Live also works flawlessly with the router.  For people who like to mod their router with firmwares and big external antennas this is probably not the device you're looking for, but in my experience for reliable high-speed use at home it just works.",,,

Second, support from Linksys is gone, vanished.  I was trying to use Microsoft Remote Desktop and realized that is appeared that the outgoing port was blocked.  This not documented anywhere I could find so I contacted Linksys.  What a disaster.  The only answer I could get was I needed to trigger the proper port for RDP to work.

The firmware and web interface is very similar to that of the G1 router, so it's very configurable and intuitive for the somewhat technically inclined.  The broadcast strength is terrific.So, it works well.  But what is wrong with companies making products that cannot be stacked, mounted or stored anywhere except on a desktop with huge swaths of free space?  This awful retro-future design makes me yearn for the DLink DIR-625 or DIR-615.  Cisco, please take note:  Computers are, for the most part, cubic boxes.  so are desks, shelves, tables and drawers.  So are my other routers and switches.  This WRT54G2 comes with no mounting hardware or even a stand so it can be stored vertically, so you need a full square foot of free space on your desktop for Cisco to advertise its stupid looking black box.Anyway, thanks for listening.

I wonder if the problem for others could be the order in which you set up your modem (with a cable broadband connection or VoIP telephone) and then your router?*Incredibly easy to set up!! Much more so then our D-Link. It literally took 5 minutes from in the box to up and running! I love the automatic encryption - makes us feel safer living in an apartment community.If anything changes I will come back and update.I highly recommend this product.*When setting up ... or re-setting ... make sure you disconnect power to all routers and modems for 2 minutes ... first power up your cable/Internet modem ... (then, IF you have a telephone modem, such as vonage or a skype stand-alone modem power it up and connect it first - this is so your calls get priority over any other devices plugged into your linksys or running wireless from it) ... then power up and connect your linksys ... you should find much better success doing things in this order!!Cheers.",,,

Amazon was great and promptly sent me a 2nd 'identical' router.  It worked great for 1 day after which it began exhibiting the same behavior, which was that it needed a reboot every 15 minutes to function properly.  spent another day on the phone with Linksys which included a remote session via the tech who promptly called me back and told me the unit was defective and that I should return it and buy another brand or model next time.Absolutely zero stars (it made me give it one) on this model, it's as buggy as mosquito season in Wisconsin.",,,

This happens even while I am in the same room about 5 feet away with no obstructions in the way.  I would have to recycle power on the Linksys to get the wireless to work again.  It is quite annoying.  So, if you are looking for a wireless router with sudden, random wireless connection drops then look no further.

I have only had the router up for 2 days but no issues at all on this one. I hope this model is more stable then my older linksys WRTG54G routers where you have to reboot the router every so often to get a signal back.

This is a huge difference from when I setup a Netgear wireless router 3 years ago, that took me 3 days and a lot of frustration.  I hope that Netgear has gotten better with their setup software.  If you need a good wireless G router, this is the one to buy.  It also works well for your wired network devices as a network switch.  I am using it for my Netflix Roku video streaming device as a wired device for optimum image quality.",,,

You just need to let the installation disk run first, then follow instructions on the screen. It took about 5 minutes total to set up the router and have a wireless connection ready to go. The coverage is excellent.Review Updated Nov. 15, 2009:This Unit failed to work after nearly 3 months. I called Linksys Tech support (I never dealt with them before), to my disappointment, it was a TERRIBLE experience. Their tech support is India and are NOT easy to deal with, they just lead you for hours (and I mean I spent more than ONE hour each time I asked for support) through path that doesn't work, and at the end, it fails again. The other problem, you can not return this item until tech support approves that, and that was another Terrible thing. Linksys tries to get you frustrated and forget about returning it. They WILL NEVER provide you with a return number.I never though Linksys (Cisco) can go that low in supporting their customer, I just couldn't believe it until I experienced that First Hand !!!!I gave this item 5 Stars at first, but all stars vanished with the TERRIBLE tech support from Linksys. Just AWFUL Tech support.",,,

If you need something to provide access to laptops and other PCs in your home, this will do the trick. The signal strength is good, even without any visible antennas. However the software configuration utility (and even the web-based setup) SUCK. I had to make multiple calls to tech support to get this thing configured, and I consider myself a very technical person. If you are looking for an essential, functional router and dont mind spending some time on the initial set up, this is for you. One good benefit, the uPnP worked great, no problems.",,,

After an hour on the phone with tech support, from India, they told me to finally go and exchange it, which I did.  That one worked up till the point where I could no longer return it and then it would constantly keep dropping it's wireless connection.  I tried it on all frequencies, at 2 different houses, with 2 different laptops, (PC and MAC), and 2 different internet providers.  No matter what I did it would keep loosing the wireless connection.  I might be able to exchange it again, with the manufacturer this time, but they would have to pay me to try to use another one of their routers.  Cisco is a very respected commercial wireless equipment provider, but since they bought Linksys, their home wireless equipment is not good.  At least Belkin and D-Link are ok.",,,

1006,XX,B0014J07R2,1,1,2,13-Dec-08,A1IA8OTYPI6T52,Worked for awhile then died,"I guess I have to join the chorus of other one star reviewers .  This router worked great for about 6 months and then I started experiencing disconnects.  I tried everything suggested by the Linksys support forums and nothing worked.  One thing I noticed is that there were a lot of other people on those forums AND Amazon reviewers who shared this issue.  One reviewer on Amazon said that this was a known issue with this router and that Linksys should issue some kind of firmware patch.  I couldn't wait for that as I make my living via the computer and constant disconnects are simply impossible for me to do business.  I make my living trading stocks so you can imagine the frustration of not knowing when the next disconnect would occur.  Anyway, I probably should have read more of the one star reviews than the 5 star reviews.  I usually purchase based on price and the reviews, but sometimes that is just not good enough.  I was so frustrated I went to the local Microcenter and purchased a $40 Netgear G router and right now it's working fine with no bumps whatsoever.",,,

Doesn't have all the features, like automatic channel selection, that my Airport Extreme or other high-end models do, but it's less than a third of the cost of a full-featured model. Does have features for parental supervision and virtually everything for basic needs. There are also higher models in the Linksys family if you need more.  Comes with an excellent Win installer and has an near identical Mac installer (Mac installer has to be downloaded so plan ahead) that did an excellent job of sensing the network parameters and setting things automatically. Also has a browser-based setup page (Mac or Win) if you need/want to tweak things manually.  I saw 6Mbps speed to the internet, wired or wireless, which I think is all the cable account supports.

The packaging implies you'll be connected within minutes.  The product offers no manual whatsoever and only an installation disk.  The disk prompts you on which cords to unhook from your current router and where to plug them in on your new router, and then prompts you to turn on the router.  The prompt icon spins for over ten minutes only to tell you there is no connection to the Internet.  There isn't a word of technical support provided other than 'make sure everything is plugged in.'If I didn't want my money back, I'd use this piece of junk as a paperweight.Please note that I wasn't able to leave no stars.

1014,XX,B0014J07R2,5,23,26,6-Dec-08,A3RVH9HUN9J4LZ,Awesome with dd-wrt firmware installed; not so much with stock firmware,"I would only give this router three stars with the stock firmware it ships with (VxWorks), but with the GPL dd-wrt firmware installed, it is a vastly superior product sporting features found on routers costing hundreds more.  I was unimpressed with the stock VxWorks firmware.  While adequate for many home users, its feature-set was underwhelming... and reliability was lacking in many respects (particularly in syncing with broadband devices like cable/DSL modems).After installing the Linux-based dd-wrt firmware on this router, i noticed two things:  Firstly, the device became more stable and robust.  For example, resetting the router no longer required power-cycling the cable modem, etc.  Secondly, even though this router only supports the 'micro' version of the dd-wrt firmware (due to its small flash RAM footprint), this firmware still offers *many* more features (and more polish) than the stock VxWorks-based Linksys firmware.For example, DHCP is vastly improved (both the client and server), and includes MAC address based static leases (i.e. computers on your LAN can be assigned static IP's via the router's DHCP server).  More advanced Quality of Service (QoS) settings.  Supports Wake-On-LAN, WDS (Wireless Distribution System, i.e. wireless bridging of multiple routers), automatic router reboots (or not).  You can control many parameters of the wireless -- including transmitter power output -- and configure the button on the front panel to toggle the wireless on/off.  It supports a variety of status screens, including graphical bandwidth usage stats.  The web admin interface even offers a choice of several color skins.  There's also a telnet admin interface.  The firmware even supports cron jobs!The dd-wrt firmware far outclasses the stock firmware, making the latter appear to be the work of Mrs. Pauli's fourth grade class.  The only down-side is the somewhat cumbersome geeky triple-flash install procedure, and all the dire warnings that you could 'brick' your router.  I did the install from an iMac, which was harder because the install procedures are written for Windoze.  [Tip for Mac users:  Use the shareware program MacTFTP (available from Version Tracker or MacUpdate) where the directions call for Linksys' tftp.exe utility, and be sure your built-in Mac OS X firewall (System Preferences) is turned off during the firmware installs.]  You can find install instructions and a download link on this page:[...]__________________________________Update (Nov-2009):  Looks like the triple-flash procedure has been simplified; one can now download a combined prep/killer file and install it via the stock firmware, then TFTP the dd-wrt firmware into place (i.e. just a double-flash now).  That should make things *much* easier (as they eliminated the step which caused the most problems).I have version 1 of this router; it supports the 'micro-plus' version of the firmware.  Also, there's now a micro+ version which supports SSH for router configuration (in addition to the GUI).Note:  LinkSys has changed internal chipsets of this router a number of times already, and might change the internal RAM specs too.  When chipsets are changed, router characteristics can change too.  Wireless performance and reliability could change, power draw and heat output, or the ability to install dd-wrt on this router.  Unfortunately, these changes could either improve the router, or make it worse.  YMMV, as the reviewer's router may be different from what you'll get, so consider that when reading user reviews here.  One way to identify different revisions is by FCC ID number.  (For rev 1, it's:  Q87-WRT54G2V1.)As regards the ability to install the dd-wrt firmware, your best bet is to check the comments below, and also check the Supported Devices list (which includes FCC ID numbers):[...]This router seems to be favored by the dd-wrt development team, probably because it is so affordable, so chances are good it will continue to be supported (unless LinkSys, in a cost-cutting measure, ever trims the specs too much.)  But you may have to wait for it to be supported, and extra features in special builds (like SSH) may not come along for the ride, so YMMV.  Checkout the dd-wrt website first if these features are important to you, so you know what to expect.",,,

The last router I set up took over an hour of fiddling and re-setting.CONS: very low range! I have a 2600 sq ft home and the router is in a downstairs office. The signal gets lost two rooms away, which is surprising and very disappointing.I liked this router when I set it up but now I intend to return it as its range is so extremely limited. I did a quick search online to find out if I could purchase something to extend it but after 30+ minutes gave up on that idea.This device would only be useful for small apartments and situations where the wireless devices were within maybe 15-20 feet of the unit.",,,

However, I have had better luck with Linksys than with other routers I've used in the past (I've had bad experiences with Belkin and Netgear products in the past).

So always I had to either restart the model or modify the connection settings but this is a great product took only a min to set up and no issues since then. I definitely recommend this.,,,
1049,XX,B0014J07R2,5,0,0,6-Nov-08,A2Q1T980XB6G8,So Far So Good,"So far, so good.  I bought this as a market standard router for our apartment after Time Warner failed to bring a router as requested.  I considered the rangemax and ultrarange as options, but decided that our 1200 sq foot apartment was probably fine with this one.  We all have relatively new computers, two of which run on Vista, so the 802.11g was compatible with all of them.  I chose Linksys based on customer reviews and overall ratings.  Netgear seemed to have the lowest rating overall but D-Link seems on par so it may work just as well.I did a bunch of research beforehand which helped a bit (I had no idea as to 802.11b versus g, etc.), and also found instructions on installing a wireless network from [...] which were actually great to have on hand since the Linksys user guide is on a CD.  Overall, setting it up was pretty easy, the only issue was that my roommate had disabled her wireless!  Once we figured that out, everything was connected.  I had to power down the modem and the router and restart the computers once they were connected to make sure everything worked but now everything is set.  I'm 30 feet and 4 walls away from the router and my internet is faster than it ever was with Time Warner.  It was worth the time and less money.",,,
1050,XX,B0014J07R2,4,0,0,5-Nov-08,A1XPJUZ1URQ7FP,No dropped signals. Great router!,"PROS (4 stars): This wireless router has been working flawlessly since I installed it about a week ago. I previously had a D-Link Rangebooster and it would drop the signal several times a day. But with this new router, there has been no dropped signal. Data and video are streaming with little to no hiccups. Router works like it should!CONS (-1 star): Install disc did not 'AutoRun' on my Macbook (OS 10.5.5). I had to install and configure the router using my PC notebook. Macbook had no problem recognizing the new wireless signal. Also, I had some trouble changing the SSID - The first time I configured the router, the router did not save the SSID I assigned it.",,,

Great speed on the iPods in all rooms and even outside.  We have two laptops that run with wired like speeds. Wired of course is also good.  Guests with their laptops log in and marvel at the internet access.  Never a problem. The Linksys WRT54G2 is highly recommended here.

But somehow it is not covering this. It is placed in my bed room and i have zero range in the living room. I wonder how I can increase its range :-( It doesnt even have a way to plug in high powered antennas.also on another note, some people (like me) buy this router in the expectation that it can be flashed with a 3rd party open source firmware to do more cool stuff. However as of today no other 3rd party firmware is supported on this router.",,,
1055,XX,B0014J07R2,1,3,6,31-Oct-08,A1H2J72FI7AIDB,Absolutely horrible,"I purchased this product from the local store to replace an old Linksys router that broke. It has been a month of trying to make this garbage work with all the computers and laptops at home and I am still having all kinds of problems. It works fine with the desktop computer that it is connected to but it just does not work any way with any of the laptops. I tried calling Linksys and the tech pretty much said that bsaed on the information I gave him it does not seem likely that it will work with both laptops, maybe with one of them at a time. I asked him to walk me through the steps of verifying the set up and he wouldn't do it unless I paid him $10 and let him log into my machine remotely which I could not do as it had sensitive work information. He HUNG UP!!! I called a local IT person who came to my house and was also unsuccessful in setting it up to work with both laptops. Bottom line, save yourself the trouble and buy something that is actually compatible with more than one computer, that is unless you are only setting up one connection.",,,
1056,XX,B0014J07R2,1,1,3,27-Oct-08,AASGR9KHGHLRM,could have been better,"the software that comes with this router is so bloated that setting up a network becomes frustrating. anything you want to connect to the wireless network must have the software loaded, which is fine for computers, but is impossible for printers or game consols. The security software prevents even your own laptops from connecting when fully enabled, even though you have the password. so you have to disable it to connect to the internet thereby rendering it useless. Even though the form factor looks good, the functionality is horrible. The linksys wrt54g, which is the older version, is a much more functional wireless router.",,,

This is my third wireless router overall and I can say after 13 months of use that it works around 95 percent of the time.  The other 5 percent it either doesn't connect when I bootup my laptop or cuts out mid-use.  Then I have to either reconnect manually or even reboot to get my internet connection back.  But after having two Netgear routers even if this one isn't great it's better than the others.The worst thing about it is that after installing it on my laptop my bootup time has just about doubled from ~90 seconds to about ~180 seconds.  Maybe it's a Vista issue, I don't know, but I definitely have to wait longer to startup my computer since I got this router.  But still, it's better than Netgear.",,,

Range is good, and speed is excellent -- my laptop works as well in the living room as my desktop does in the computer room hooked up to the modem.I felt the price was very fair, as well.In short, I wholeheartedly recommend this product to somebody who is looking to set up a basic home network involving a laptop or two sharing a broadband connection.

I think it's as easy as it can get, plug it, run the wizard from the CD and you're ready to go.3. Admin software. Very intuitive, easy to use and give you some network tools for troubleshooting.4.

Reception is surprisingly good for internal antennae, and the web config interface is familiar.Linksys won't let you change the TCP idle timeout, though.  Use DD-WRT, traffic hacks/keepalives, or expect your idle terminal connections to be axed at 10 minutes.  Wish I'd realized that before I decided to order this over another original WRT54G(L).",,,

Initially this router worked fine for my needs and was very easy to set up.  After a few weeks I noticed that it needed to be reset practically every day.  We are online alot in my house and need a more reliable router.The salesman warned me that this router didn't have alot of range which was fine in my home but the signal is practically lost once you step out on the back porch.,,,
1076,XX,B0014J07R2,2,1,2,10-Oct-08,A1HNX8F00XPD5,"Trouble setting up, Linksys Technical Support terrible!","I received this product yesterday and the router's setup CD errored out almost immediately.  During the very start of the setup, when it scans for Internet ports, it kept reporting error 311, that I could not set up the router on a wireless connection (???).  My PC setup is a very simple arrangement.  I use Windows XP.  My Motorola cable modem is connected directly to an Ethernet port on the back of my PC.  A router or any wireless device has never been connected to my PC.After checking my device/network settings (all fine) and rebooting the cable modem and PC, and retrying the setup CD several times, all with the same result (the error), I called Linksys Technical Support.  (I also found that others reported this same error on Linksys' forum, but the question was never answered).Support was horrible.  First off, it was so noisy there I could barely hear the guy.  He had problems hearing me as well, and he initially asked if I could call back on another phone.  I was calling on a land line phone, the problem was on his end... it sounded like a crowded party over there.  100 people all conversing at the same time.I explained the problem.  He did not have me check anything on my PC or walk me through anything.  He came to the conclusion that the problem was a setting in my cable modem and he gave me 2 options.  #1, he could install 'a diagnostic program' on my PC remotely, but this would cost $9.95.  #2, I can call my ISP (Cablevision) and have them make the modem 'router-compatible'.  Both options seemed ridiculous but I opted to call Cablevision and run this by them rather than pay $9.95, which I deemed unfair.In all honesty though, although my conversation with Linksys Support lasted all of ten minutes, I was happy to get off the phone with them as communicating through all the noise on his end was arduous to say the least.As you probably suspected, Cablevision said there are NO setting in the modem that they can change, and the rep at Cablevision was very familiar with my router as he owns one himself.  He walked me through checking my network settings, etc.  He was familiar with the router's setup CD and the router's setup process.  We were on the phone for about 30 mins.  He was baffled and ended up telling me that I really needed to call Linksys Technical Support again.I didn't call Linksys back.  In the end, I was able to set up the router without using the CD.  So far, so good.  As far as Linksys Technical Support is concerned though, they get a flying 'F'.  They were a useless waste of time.I purchased this wireless router so my Playstation 3 can wirelessly connect to the Internet, and I have to add that the wireless setup on the PS3 side was amazing.  After finally getting the router set up, I dreaded the thought of setting up the PS3 to communicate with it, but as far as the PS3 end of it is concerned, it automatically configured and connected itself to the router's wireless signal in less than a minute.",,,

It would never connect to my iPod touch either, even when I turned off mac address filtering and all of that.  There also wasn't any software for Macs which was annoying.  I had to use the web based client which, wasn't that hard, but you have to be tech savvy to know what to change to make it work.  Plus it looks like a cheap piece of garbage.This one is great though.  It never drops connection, there is software to set up for Macs and PC's, and it looks nice.  Its very thin and the antenna are internal, which is much more pleasing to the eye.  I was afraid that it wouldn't be powerful for that reason but it can still go through a few different brick walls and provide wi-fi into my dorm lobby, so it has really good strength.  The set up was a piece of cake; took like ten minutes, most of which was just because you have to reconnect the cables a couple of times and wait for it to sync up.Overall I'm extremely satisfied with the product and I highly recommend this router.",,,
1099,XX,B0014J07R2,4,0,0,27-Sep-08,AQBV2ZOB8OJQS,Good product from Linksys,It's been over 2 months since I am using this router. It was easy to setup and signal strength is great. I gave 4 stars because the software that came with the router is not that great for managing all the devices. I initially installed the software to see how it works. Then had to re-install as my laptop does not get the wireless signal right after it starts up. I had to select and then enable it.,,,

I bought this router because of the good reviews, and I have to admit that at close distance (under 40 feet) it works very well, but if you're buying it for its long-range wireless capability, like I did, you're in for a disappointment.",,,

NYC apartment.Important to note that, if you are a Mac user, you must:1. Locate, download and install the Mac software from the Linksys siteThis is by no means straightforward; several links were dead or broken before I found the correct link for the updated software2. Locate your computer near the router for set up (must be done connected via Ethernet)Aside from these minor issues, my throughput has been great, and overall performance enhanced by the addition of the new router. I especially like the fact that it has 4 additional Ethernet ports in back.",,,

If speed is your thing, this router is DEFINITELY not for you.  if you need a big range, this router will disappoint you.  I live in a 2500 sq ft house and this router will not deliver good signal throughout the house.  This router will be good for about a few weeks, but later on, you will probably need to reset it every so often because your wireless connection will be dropped.  If you are looking for a good reliable router for your house, I would suggest the D-Link DIR-655.  If you want a regular router for a medium size apartment and you don't play a lot of games or downloads, this router will fit your most basic needs, nothing more.",,,

The installation is easy and you can put it any where in your house because it has a beautiful body shap. I think in comparison to price it is good. Moreover, I received it in 2 days and in perfect shap. I recommand this product.",,,
1107,XX,B0014J07R2,3,4,5,19-Sep-08,A3UQNOLPIDI9TT,Disappointing; Set Up Issues,"Got this to use with a Verizon DSL plan & Verizon supplied modem. Installed and set it up on a low end Compaq SR5233WM desktop with 2GB memory and Vista Home Premium.I thought since it was a newer model it'd work better with Vista, but setup was not easy: On the first 2 attempts, the setup program got to the point where the router was to be connected to a power source; after powering it up, the software gave an error message not recognizing the router and saying to check the connections, etc. (which were fine). It finally installed on the 3rd try.Next, when it came time to add a laptop wirelessly, I was surprised to see that the router name, network name and security settings I assigned during installation were NOT applied, yet the Lynksys data sheet printout indicated they were applied! After much fussing and time, went into advanced settings to make the corrections. Fortunately that worked. Adding the laptop was the easiest and fastest part of the setup. Judging by the number of unsecured Linksys networks I see whenever (and wherever) I go into my laptops' 'connect to a network' utility, makes me wonder how many Linksys users are out there thinking that their security settings are set when they really aren't and their signal is unsecured....After getting this all sorted out, the Linksys Easy Link Advisor software began acting up; sometimes it launches, sometimes not. Maybe I'll eventually get that sorted out. Conclusion: What should have taken 10-20 minutes at most took hours to sort out and I'm really bugged the Lynksys software network security settings printout confirmed security settings, name, etc. were taken when they were not. If it wasn't such a bear to get set up, I'd have rated it higher: Wireless signal/range meets my needs, connectivity is good, etc. I also just installed a Belkin My Essentials router, about as low end as you can get, for a friend; it was a much faster, easier, straightforward setup than this thing and it had me wishing I'd gone for that over the Lynksys. The Belkin was also smaller and could be stood vertically to minimize the footprint.Follow up: Gave up on the Linksys Easy Link Advisor Software; had to reinstall it when I wanted it to run. It also caused a Vista error message on shut down, saying a program wasn't properly initializing. Ran system restore, reinstalled everything except the Linksys software, and no more problems. (I'm sure the problem was the Linksys software; I made the mistake of reinstalling it after running system restore, and the problem was back). If I need to get at the router settings, I go directly to the Linksys setup page online. One more thing: The ability to wall mount it saves desk space.Oct. 2009 update: Unit has been on 24/7 since set up and is working OK but had to reboot it 2, maybe 3 times so far. So, other than the disappointing set up & software issues, I'm more or less satisfied.",,,

I don't download large files or anything but unlike the 3 previous routers (Dlink, old Linksys, etc.) that I had, this one has never once lost connection. I am very happy with this product.",,,
1109,XX,B0014J07R2,1,3,6,16-Sep-08,A2SSKN26MU791J,The Worst!,"This was my first router from Linksys and it will be my last!  Not only did the router fail to work right since day one, but the outsourced technical support in India was terrible!  The people I spoke to were rude and often hung up on me!  Most of them could not speak good English!  And the wait times were awful!  Never ever again!!",,,
1110,XX,B0014J07R2,4,0,2,16-Sep-08,A3GS652N046WCY,"Nice product, if I could get it configured","Bought this about a month ago and still don't have it working with my system. They do an excellent job of walking you through the set-up so theoretically, it should be dead easy even for the most technophobic. My first problem was finding out I had a dead NIC card on my pc. This took 3 weeks of wondering why I couldn't 'see' the router, no matter what I did. There is NO online help that tells you to check for that. Everything keeps telling you to type in the router address...well, that's great if you can get it's page, not so much when you can't. Now I'm stuck because there is no way to hook the router up via USB (which is how my cable modem is hooked to my pc), and it won't let me configure it via my wireless laptop. Now, I have no time to mess with it until after the semester is over. I could hook it up to my cable modem and broadcast and unsecured signal that works fine with my wireless laptop, but then that could leave my pc vulnerable. There really has to be an easier way to get all these things working together. This is why I long ago decided I did NOT want to work in networking and tech support. This stuff isn't made for people lacking a lot of networking experience and patience. Bottom line: as long as your system works doesn't have any unusual configurations, this product is great and does have a really nice set-up interface.",,,

New iPod touch was getting iffy/useless signal, 2 MacBooks experiencing sporadic loss of signal (necessitating router reboots), etc. Gah. I also have 3 PCs (Win2k) and a new MacPro. Leopard on all Macs.So I got it, used the CDROM that came with, followed instructions (instead of winging it, as I usually do), and I am VERY happy with the results. Pegged signals on all wifi gear, good coverage, full-time, no problems. Price point is ridiculous, quality superb. It even looks kinda cool.The only catch was with our Tivo... It can't recognize wifi with the new/improved security (WPA2). A tolerable gotcha, no fault of the Linksys. Still deciding whether to buy the new USB/wifi stick for the Tivo or just chuck it for Dish Network hookup. Hm.",,,

I've had it for about three weeks now and I have not had to reset it once like I had to do with other routers in the past. I had one minor issue but fortunately I figured out what to do and did not have to contact support. At first the router said that it did not detect an internet connection. I needed to restart my cable modem once I plugged it into the router. That did the trick and since then, the router has worked flawlessly.",,,
1114,XX,B0014J07R2,4,1,1,12-Sep-08,AJB0OAEIYGY87,Almost perfect.,"The router works very well. I didn't need the setup CD (it would not have worked anyway, as this is a Linux computer). Setting up wireless for my PSP went without a hitch. Downside: no documentation in box. The company apparently expects the setup CD to do it all for you, and I suppose that's OK for Windows and Mac users. The manual I printed off the Linksys site is sketchy in places, mostly on defining terms, and assumes the customer already has fairly extensive knowledge of networking. This is an excellent product, but buy a good networking book with it if you're setting up a home network for the first time.",,,

I hooked up my router to a PC and then I use internet on my laptop and my iMac, from at most 40 feet away through two floors. Now whenever I am online I have to refresh a page at least 3 times until it will load, it is so slow, I wish i had my old one back. By the way the phone support was horrible, 40 minutes of my life I will never get back. I also pinged my router and it said I lose 0% of my connection, so I have no idea what the problem is, but I know it's something with the router",,,

To be fair, I was able to get through to a second support person who got me online. After using this wireless router I found that I could only connect in the very next room with the wireless portion. My house is about 2,900 square feet and I can only connect in the next room? The wireless aspect is useless to me. I then decided to buy a D-Link router, which I just opened up. I called the D-Link phone support and was caught in an endless automated phone loop. No matter what number I selected, it would not change options. SO, that router is going back-NO support then I'm not keeping it. Next, I decided to re-connect my old Linksys BEFSR41 router to just use my wired system. I called back to Linksys to get support on re-connecting my older equipment. I'm CURRENTLY on hold with the FOURTH technical support person. Mind you, their support is in the Philippines and is VOIP. The support folks seem to know their products but the communication is TERRIBLE. I give the support people credit because their english is very good and they are efficient. BUT, the VOIP connection is SOOOOO bad that you hear en echo of yourself. It's almost impossible to have a conversation with anyone using their phone system. HORRIBLE support - the service of American companies has diminished so much. I fear that it will only get worse, eventually having no support whatsoever. It's almost that bad now.",,,
