175	I was to the point where I was just going to return the product and give up.	0
176	I found out that the hardware in the device is not to blame but it was the firmware that has many issues and limited compatibility	0
177	NOTE: v2.0 is not supported.4.	0
178	I had some difficulty at first because i had a router set up already but once I figured out what I was doing wrong it has been working just fine.	0
179	"After way too much time, I discovered that the hardware can do the job, but the firmware it is running from Linksys wont allow it."	0
180	"Even as a techie, this was way more than I had bargained for and took way too long."	0
181	"Why build a product that has built in features, only to cripple it to have less capability?"	0
182	So in the end the hardware might be 5 stars but the firmware only 1 star.	0

185	"I found I could only run in B-G mode without recycling it at least once a day, otherwise it dropped all connections and failed to respond."	0

196	The customer support chat told me that I could not get free chat support because the item is no longer under warranty.	0
197	They want $29.95 to help fix the problem.	0
198	I will never buy another Cisco product!!	0
199	"I called my router company (per Sonys instructions)Cisco Linksys to get the ports open, and they would open the ports needed...for $29.95 (or somewhere in that ballpark)."	0
200	The customer service is hard to understand (outsourced from another country I suspect).	0
201	"I suppose if you are a computer programmer this will be okay, you will know your way around, but if you are the average Jane you will be screwed."	0
202	I can pay $30 every time I need help after my first year or...buy another router.	0
203	I am using this router for 1.5 year and I have not any problem until now.	0
204	"I have tried many suggestions I found on Amazon as well as other forums, but to no avail."	0
205	Promotional software is helpful but is only a trial so what appears to be something special is actually extra.	0
206	Seems to need fewer occasional resets to keep it alive than most routers.	0
207	NOT happy with this product	0
208	"slower than my G router (also linksys)took forever to set up , and more than 2 hours on the phone with linksys finally working, and SLOWER than my old router"	0

210	"When I notice things moving a little sluggishly, I reboot it, maybe every 3-4 months?"	0
211	You are better off with the free version because customer service is almost not there.	0
212	Unfortunately I ended up buying this router after reading the reviews on Amazon.	0
213	The router was running super slow via wifi.	0

215	Unfortunately the router started dropping connections all the time.	0
216	This router is a piece of junk and to save your time and money....DO NOT BUY IT.	0
217	I personally find the time spent trying to fix this junk more valuable than the $ spent.	0
218	"Cisco tries to force  its software for management, not good to do that."	0
219	Wireless stability not good.	0

227	"First one died, second one was unstable."	0
228	Do not buy this item.	0
229	"I love the Router, I did not like the fact that when I bought it, It was not restored to the factory settings so I had to figure that out while having the previous owners password and username on there, After about an hour I figured it out, Works great for what I needed it for, I am running a laptop and a ps3, The Laptop is my media server for the ps3 and I have not had a problem with it, I do not know about running lots of things off of it but for what I needed it for I cant complain, And Especially when it came to the price, Cant beat it"	0

232	"When I contacted Linksys customer service, I was told its no longer supported."	0

235	Within four months time it stopped working.	0
236	When I contacted the customer support they told to upgrade the firm ware and asked to pay $30 for that.	0
237	"As the unit is all black, it is a little hard to see."	0

249	After about a year the thing started to fail.	0
250	"It was out of warranty by 4 (yes, four) days and they refused to do anything about it."	0
251	there is a reason this router has so many 1 star ratings.	0
252	"As for Ciscos customer service, its not really a service at all."	0
253	"Over several days trying to install the router (both on Mac and Windows) without ever getting to the point where the installation could find the router, I called Linksys tech support."	0
254	After two hours on the phone with a technician and providing access by the technician to my computer there was still no way that the router could be installed with the software provided with the router	0
255	"Disconnecting every 10 minutes, and I had to restart the router every time."	0
256	"The problem was solved for a year, then started again."	0
257	"I called them again, this time they asked for $15 to fix the problem."	0
258	"I rejected the offer, since I had to pay them $15 every year to fix the problem."	0

260	"Not Recommended at all, since you have to spend money on it every year."	0
261	"However, I was getting Cannot connect to WRT160N with WPA errors on two separate Windows 7 laptop machines located within a very strong signal strength distance."	0
262	"I spent considerable time looking through the manufacturers support forum and found some complex instructions that had me changing beacon thresholds, fragmentation thresholds, and RTS thresholds."	0
263	"However, the connections would intermittently drop and then have trouble reconnecting"	0
264	"After a while, I gave up this WRT160N and purchased a cheaper device from a competitor."	0
265	"In summary, the Cisco-Linksys WRT160N was a waste of my time and money."	0
266	The big problem is with its DNS caching.	0
267	This was never fixed in the latest firmware and continues to be an issue	0
268	There is no way to configure the router not to set itself as the first DNS server when using DHCP.	0
269	Whats frustrating is that this has been a known issue for this router for many years and Linksys/Cisco do not appear to be willing to do anything about it	0
270	"There are better routers out there for similar money that wont have these same issues, though."	0
271	Linksys offers a 90 day warranty when others only offer a 30 day warranty and their quality control seems to be very good.	0
272	"Unfortunately it comes with an odd but very serious problem--ignored by Cisco--where it will randomly redirect your request to Facebook to MySpace, Google to Wikipedia, etc"	0
273	This router messes those up with regularity.	0
274	While its amusing at first--hey Facebook is now MySpace--this is a serious security issue.	0
275	If the router chooses to redirect Google to a site that looks just like Google--but is controlled by a third-party--you could enter your username and password into that third partys system.	0
276	The third party could then use those credentials to access your account.	0
277	Imagine if that happened with your Amazon account?	0
278	"Or your bank?There is a two-year old thread on Ciscos site about this, with no solution (Google WRT160N dns).This is unacceptable in a product from a major vendor."	0
279	"I made the mistake of buying this router, but you should not."	0
280	Do not buy this router.	0
281	Our problems began almost immediately.	0
282	"If we tried to connect a second laptop, the router would usually drop the the first connection."	0
283	Sometimes we would have to resort rebooting one or both computers.	0
284	"It made no difference how we attempted to configure the network, one or both computers connected wirelessly or through the wired ports, we could not count on having both machines connected to the internet through the router at the same time"	0
285	We experienced the same problem whenever anyone in our neighborhood turned on their network.	0
286	"Whenever a neighbor did that, our router immediately forgot who it was and what it was supposed to be doing, and required a power reset"	0
287	Quite often the router would not let my wife connect to her Facebook account.	0
288	"If we connected her machine to our cable modem directly, she would have no problems"	0
289	Watching online videos was another hit or miss proposition.	0
290	"Very often, we could watch 10 to 20 minutes of videos, before the router stopped functioning, and we would have to perform a power rest"	0
291	Customer support was problematic.	0
292	I have a hearing disability and understanding anyone with a heavy accent (read offshore) is very difficult	0
293	This is a router that never should have come to market	0
294	I strongly suggest you do not purchase this router and I would have strong reservations about purchasing any home or small business router made by Cisco.	0
295	But wireless is not so good.	0
296	"My main machine is wired, and connects just fine, but I have had nothing but trouble from this router when trying to connect laptops wirelessly -- three different laptops, three separate occasions -- even when using its installer via USB drive."	0
297	"Signal strength can be medium to poor, with the laptop only inches away from the router, and throughput is horrible."	0
298	"Before you purchase this item, please be aware that this router has been shown to redirect users to random websites (e"	0
299	I WOULD NOT buy this router unless you are prepared to invest time dealing with the inconvenience (and potential danger)arising from this redirection problem.	0
300	The specs should say the range of the router but this is where its not so good if you live in a two story house or a large single story one.	0
301	If I use my pc on the kitchen or further I notice my signal drops by half.	0
302	"As you can read, the range is not so good."	0
303	"And then, it began to have disconnection problem first once a day."	0
304	And the disconnection problem frequency increased every week.	0
305	Now it is more disconnected than it is connected to the web.	0
306	Every time the disconnection happens I have to unplug the power adapter from the power outlet and wait several minutes till its cool down	0
307	"If you are looking for a reliable router, I would definitely not recommend this one."	0
308	This is where things started to go wrong.	0
309	"However, when I connect through the Linksys WRT160N router, the connection speed degrades throughout the day to 4 Mps."	0
310	They did not offer to help me upgrade the firmware.	0
311	I am not sure I will stick with Linksys.	0
312	"SO, I follow the router CD installation instructions, attempted a network repair using their crummy software utility, disabled the software firewall on my PC, performed a firmware upgrade, did the DD-WRT thing as well, you name it, I tried it!"	0
313	"After about 3.5 hours, I was so put off, I took the router outside and put a hammer through it and proceeded to tossed it - in the garbage!"	0
314	Please do not waste your time and $$$ on this piece of junk.	0
315	My biggest complaint about the router is its advertised insistence that set-up was a piece of cake.	0
316	Nope it was not.	0
317	"It should have been, but was not."	0
318	Called Linksys/Cisco tech support -- the representative had no interest in really helping.	0
319	"The Linksys rep should have done what our network engineer friend did, but he either was not allowed to, did not know how to, or did not want to."	0
320	And that to me is very disconcerting.	0
321	Linksys support is nothing like it used to be.	0
322	"I managed to establish a wireless connection, but could not maintain it for any extended period of time."	0
323	It would even drop connection in the next room after a few minutes.	0
324	"This is where the nightmare began..My laptop (a 15 Macbook Pro from 2008; Ive never had problems connecting to any other wireless networks before) detected the network at full strength but refused to connect, and consistently displayed connection failed or connection timeout errors."	0
325	"I flashed DD-WRT onto the router, but that did not help anything."	0
326	"For reference, my laptop was sitting RIGHT NEXT TO THE ROUTER on my desk"	0
327	"At this point I was wondering if it was a problem with my laptop, so I borrowed a friends and tried connecting from there."	0
328	"At first, his laptop would not even detect the network from the next room."	0
329	"After moving it closer, it just gave the same error messages I was receiving."	0
330	"From my experience with the WRT-160Nv3, I conclude that it may make a decent network router if you plan on only using ethernet (for 50 bucks its hardly worth it), but it makes a downright terrible wireless router."	0
331	Seriously.. the wireless part did not even work.	0
332	"This was a major disappointment, as Ive had great experiences with all the Cisco/Linksys products Ive used in the past."	0
333	"Please, do not even consider buying this product unless you are a glutton for punishment."	0
334	"Linksys KNOWS the firmware inside is flawed, and they are not making any efforts to fix it."	0
335	You will have multiple sites that occasionally will not load.	0
336	You will have multiple sites that will be mysteriously re-directed to other pages.	0
337	The easy solution to these problems is to not buy this router.	0
338	"When I am able, I just bypass the router and let it sit unused."	0
339	its a good product but i wish it had a stronger out put or signal my netbook could reach better.	0
340	"Did all the instructions implied,but no success."	0
341	"Every once in a while I do have to unplug it for a quick reset though, because my computers wont be able to connect for some unknown reason."	0
342	"My regret comes in that I was hoping this would improve the speed of my network enough for streaming HD Netflix movies to my XBOX without interruption, which it alone does not."	0
343	"The speed now is good enough to broadcast HD, but interference causes it to adjust down to lower resolution."	0
344	Its a bit annoying	0
345	"It just randomly dropped the connection, and I mean in intervals of minutes or hours, not days, so I returned it."	0
346	"Be careful with N technology, it seems a bit buggy on the receiving end."	0
347	"If you want to stream HD and/or have more than basic surfing needs, probably best to pay for the dual band N routers for dedicated channels instead of this basic version."	0
348	This router has an issue where it does not resolve DNS correctly.	0
349	"I was a HUGE Linksys fan, but now I will avoiding them."	0
350	Could not get it working at all even after several calls to support.	0
351	It would never get an internet connection from my Comcast modem.	0
352	Ended up returning it and getting a Belkin from Costco with similar specs and it worked without any hitches.	0
353	The only (minor) criticism I have concerns the styling which means the router takes up more space than it should and cannot be stacked.	0
354	"I called your technical support line and spoke to someone, which was nearly impossible to understand, for over an hour."	0
355	He did not know what he was doing and at one point wanted me to PAY him to remote access my computer to install the router.	0
356	Obviously its not my fault that the required information needed to install the router was not included in the package so its not my responsibility to pay for services that would not have been required had the information been provided to me in the first place.	0
357	Finally I was able to get him to understand that I would install the router all I needed from him was the information not provided in the packaging.	0
358	Now 1 year later the router stops working.	0
359	No rhyme or reason just stops!	0
360	"Again I call customer support and now I am told that I am out of warranty so I will have to pay for technical support or go online, which is impossible due to the fact that the router is broken."	0
361	The women I spoke to was absolutely rude and repeatedly tried to pass the blame onto me.	0
362	Saying there must have been a power outage and if I would have used a surge protector...Which I do by the way and I havent had a power outage.	0
363	And if I had you are telling me that your products fail when there is an outage and now its my responsibility to pay to fix your defective equipment?	0
364	I told her I wanted to speak to a supervisor and was told that was not going to happen.	0
365	You need some changes to customer/technical support.	0
366	They clearly are not helping you maintain customers.	0
367	I am having trouble understanding how a router is working one day and just broken the next and clearly so does your staff as they repeatedly place blame on the consumer.	0
368	I have never been more frustrated and disappointed with a company.	0
369	I would not recommend this product or any other from this manufacturer.	0
370	Complete failure as far as your customer service and technical support are concerned.	0
371	This router works well... most of the time.	1
372	This is a great router and worked without hassle.	1
373	The software made it easy and it has the regular amount of control you would expect from a router now a days.	1
374	It works so well that I forgot about it.	1
375	I did not touch it for over a year and only then because I moved.	1
376	One of them worked perfectly and the other did not work at all and as they were purchased from an unauthorized dealer there was no warranty.	1
377	"After 1 month the working one still works great, but I had to purchase another of these routers to replace the broken one"	1
378	"This is the first time I have had an issue about an non-working product so I would not use that to deter your purchasing the item, because overall (if they work) they work very well"	1
379	A good item.	1
380	We hooked it up and it simplified all the cords and hookups on my computer.	1
381	Satisfied with this computer gadget.	1
382	I set this router up for a small business and it works great.	1
383	"Fast, secure, and reliable."	1
384	"easy install, so far it seems to be matching the performance that was described."	1
385	"Easy set-up simply put the disk in, follow directions, print the encryption code and connect!"	1
386	"The range is exceptional, especially in our large home with all the supported electronic devices (laptop, tablet, printers and PC)!"	1
387	This is a great router for the money.	1
388	I now use the older brother as a wireless bridge to my Linux cluster in the basement and my wife is very happy about not having a network cable running across the kitchen floor to the basement anymore.	1
389	"If you have problems with this router, return it and get a new one."	1
390	"When you make thousands of something, there is bound to be a few getting past QC with a flaw or two."	1
391	Just get your new one and enjoy.	1
392	It was a decent router while I had it.	1
393	Easy set-up and decent WiFi for my basic needs.	1
394	"It was great for computers, laptops, and printers, but other devices, not so much."	1
395	"If you just need a basic WiFi for 1 - 2 computers (no tablets, smart phones, printers, Netflix, etc.), it would probably work fine."	1
396	I now have a much superior Apple Extreme Airport router.	1
397	Ive bought and installed 3 of these over the past 2 years.	1
398	"The first I bought for my home 2 years ago, the second I ordered and installed for a friend who wanted one like mine, and the third I ordered and installed a week ago for a family member"	1
399	"Now after the update, its simple and works every single time."	1
400	It was easy to install and has worked great so far.	1
401	The price was excellent as we shopped around before looking at Amazon.	1
402	I think Amazon has great prices on everything we have bought from you!	1
403	I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a router and looking for a great price!	1
404	He suggested wireless because of the size of our home and said anything by Cisco-Linksys he highly recommended.	1
405	The system is now up and running and working beautifully - thanks to Cisco-Linksys WRT160N Wireless-N Broadband Router	1
406	"Good price, good product!"	1
407	This router was easy to set up and configure to my home network needs.	1
408	"However, after about a year, the router has become unstable and randomly freezes."	1
409	Worked okay (but not great) for about a year.	1
410	I really enjoy the Cisco-Linksys WRT160N Wireless-N Broadband Router.	1
411	It allows my family and I to move throughout our home without having to be connected to a main hub and ethernet cords.	1
412	"Also, the delivery of the router from misskrs777 was very prompt."	1
413	But I must say it was a breeze to setup the WRT160N Version 3 it took me less than 5 minutes.	1
414	The linksys device is a very good device.	1
415	I like the security feathers on my device and my network.	1
416	One of the feather I like is the network magic.	1
417	It makes you see who are the intruders on your network and when they have connected to your network.	1
418	You can remove the and block from connecting to your network again.	1
419	Another feather is the test your speed system.	1
420	Which help you test your upload and down speeds.	1
421	Also you can test the speed in your area too.	1
422	The linksys makes it so easy to monitor your network anytime.	1
423	it is easy to install and setup.	1
424	I have had great luck with all my other linksys items.	1
425	"So I flashed it with the free firmware from dd-wrt, and its suddenly been working for one year now"	1
426	Had a real headache to set it up but after it was installed it works just fine.	1
427	The range is good and so far the router has had no problems.	1
428	The new router solves all of these problems.	1
429	Have been running it now for over a months - and have not had one issue with it!	1
430	When I first purchased my first wireless network it was made from Linksys.	1
431	So I pulled my old model out the closet and done the same thing and it worked too.	1
432	And the other one did as well.	1
433	This product works good and its interface was easy to use but it did not extend my range within the house that I was looking for.	1
434	Easy to set up and the range is excellent	1
435	I like it.	1
436	"Since then, however its been a dream."	1
437	Its wonderful to sit in my own living room and buy books.	1
438	Id recommend it to anyone thinking of going wifi.	1
439	"So far, this router has been perfectly reliable"	1
440	Since the initial install I have not been back into the configuration for much of anything.	1
441	It just works.	1
442	"I do not have to power cycle it for no reason, and I have not had to update its firmware in some futile attempt to fix one glitch or another."	1
443	It just sits there and works.	1
444	Like it should	1
445	"The range is good enough that my outdoor WiFi security camera works well, and the speed is good enough for streaming HD video"	1
446	And it does not look half bad.	1
447	"So far with the newest Linksys firmware its been stable, range seems better, it has not had to be reset, and works great with the new Motorola cable modem."	1
448	"Works great with the Xbox, set up port forwarding, and have not had any NAT issues."	1
449	But I got it and it works amazingly!	1
450	Highly recommended	1
451	LOVE THIS PRODUCT.	1
452	Worth every penny.	1
453	I have game systems and multiple laptops and absolutely no issue.	1
454	Installation was a breeze and I am very pleased with this purchase.	1
455	Id recommend it to anyone with a home network or small office in need of a compact yet powerful router	1
456	Plus they offer free support on the router for as long as I have my internet through them.	1
457	"The router was easy to set up; most of the time give adequate signal, but some time give very low signal."	1
458	Also there is the parental control work well need to re-adjust otherwise block lots email from coming in	1
459	"sets up easy with modem and wireless laptop, but a real pain to set up with ipod and kindle."	1
460	"Apple routers (in my experience) have been pretty stable also, but you Window fan boys might not like to hear that."	1
461	Really easy set-up.	1
462	The software walks you through the whole thing.	1
463	I was able to connect my iPod Touch 2nd generation without any problems.	1
464	PCs connected without any problem.	1
465	Very happy with the product.	1
466	"Just to clarify, THIS CAN EASILY BE FIXED."	1
467	This can be done by flashing the DD-WRT firmware for this particular router on the DD-WRT website.	1
468	"By doing so, how the router operates is completely re-worked for the better and drastically increases this devices performance and usability."	1
469	"After flashing DD-WRT, I noticed faster speeds, better range, all devices connected accordingly, and no dropped or frozen connections"	1
470	This router is amazing once you follow my steps provided and hopefully it works for those of you who try this!	1
471	These steps should not take any more than 20-30 minutes if you follow the steps correctly.	1
472	"I am on my third one of these WRT160N routers, they are easy to set-up and configure, but the new design makes these things run too hot and when they get hot they stop working reliably"	1
473	"I have mine set-up in a closet that allows it to be in reach of 7 wireless components, including an XBox360, WII, Nintendo DS and DSi, Two laptops and a remote desktop."	1
474	The refurbish units last as good as the new one did.	1
475	Highly recommended especially for novices who simply want wireless in their house.	1
476	I am Glad i bought this product.	1
477	"Its amazing it got the look, and the use."	1
478	I mean i can get 100% of the usage of this.	1
479	"I do the printing, I use the Wifi from my blackberry, and i can get online from any spot of my house with my laptop."	1
480	Just great.	1
481	"When it works, it works."	1
482	Did some research on ROKUs website and the WRT160N was tested for compatibility.	1
483	I have the WRT 160N V3 device.	1
484	"Quick connection, no problems and superior picture."	1
485	"For about 100 bucks, you cant beat the deal."	1
486	Streaming video is the BOMB.	1
487	Great product!	1
488	"Its a great product, once installed, I connected my cell phone and my laptops in just a click and the speed is phenomenal."	1
489	Its very easy to set up and use.	1
490	Other than the range I like it very much!	1
491	"Great router, i run my ps3 wii two computers and now my sat receiver."	1
492	"Easy set up, great range and speed!"	1
493	For 44 bucks try it out (it sells in Walmart	1
494	"Okay, they will help you set up the router if you need help."	1
495	"That is nice, but buyer beware!!"	1
496	"They tell you that you can do it yourself, however I did not have the admin code and passcode required to get in the system to make changes myself."	1
497	"It works well, but if you buy an updated device after the first year you have the router and need help (like needing ports opened on your router, as was my case) they will only help you for a hefty fee."	1
498	Very good router for its price.	1
499	This one surpassed my expectations.	1
500	It was easy for me to set up.	1
501	And it gives me great range.	1
502	It streams movies downstairs with no problems at all.	1
503	Very glad that I bought it.	1
504	"The wired connections work great, but the WiFi is flaky."	1
505	"When the WiFi works it is fast, but I have to reset the router every 2-3 days to make sure that my wireless devices can connect."	1
506	Fairly easy to set up.	1
507	The N speed is nice for my wife who has that capability built into her laptop.	1
508	The router was very easy to install.	1
509	The walk through instructions were very clear.	1
510	Setting it up was fast and easy!	1
511	"It looks good, runs cool, has blinking lights"	1
512	I just login to the router with the 192.168.1.1 and setup the wpa2 security/password.	1
513	"I play online games with no issues, make phone calls with google phone."	1
514	It has given me no issues when it is working properly	1
515	"It has been working fine since, I have been streaming LOTS of netflix and surfing lots of WWW and it has not had an issue since"	1
516	Overall I am satisfied with this router.	1
517	Its not perfect but its better then the alternatives from Belkin/D-Link/Netgear.	1
518	It was easy to setup and works well.	1
519	No dropped connections at all	1
520	Now I do not even remember the last time I re-booted this one !I would recommend this product to anyone looking for peace of mind ..	1
521	I was unable to set it up myself but the Linksys tech was very nice and patient with me.	1
522	We got it set up it is working great.	1
523	Lots of people complained about its unreliability however few people mentioned that with the DD-WRT software the router would work fine.	1
524	Anyhow...I bought it and initially installed it with the default Linksys firmware.	1
525	After installing this firmware the change in speed was dramatic - as good as with direct connection via LAN cable.	1
526	"Much, much better the Linksys 54 G"	1
527	This is a good router and gr8 value for money but..the firmware should be upgraded as soon as you get it since i encountered a lot of issues with the old firmware.	1
528	"After the upgrade, router had solid performance..no complains thus far..UPDATE: router started dropping connections so i installed dd-wrt firmware and its better than ever..no probs and incresed range and speed."	1
529	Switched this N router for an old linksys G and internet is stable and running 10 times better.	1
530	"Set up was a snap, just plugged it in to the wall/modem and navigated to the home IP address, where I set the name and password."	1
531	"For a simple home network, what else do you need?This router replaced a very old router that was humming when plugged in, and had been heat-stained from white to yellow."	1
532	"It was having shoddy performance, and replacing it with this router made a world of difference."	1
533	This router does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it well.	1
534	Ive had it hooked up for a couple of weeks now and its working just fine with both my primary laptop and my supplemental one.	1
535	"If you are looking for an inexpensive router, this is a good one to get."	1
536	it works well as a wired router	1
537	"It was the only one with sufficient range to reach a repeater through solid masonry walls so that my entire apartment had WiFi coverage, and the only one that maintained a constant connection with the repeater (the Netgear and 2Wire routers I had tried previously simply could not stay connected to a repeater)."	1
538	"Yes, the WRT160N did drop connections with clients until I upgraded the firmware to the latest version."	1
539	"With that problem solved, it appears to be rock-solid in performance."	1
540	The router does not come with much documentation but fortunately does not need much.	1
541	Nice to see this one now supports WPA2.The one thing that was different from my old router is this one has a power switch located in the middle of of the LED indicators.	1
542	Installation was flawless and quick.	1
543	I was provided a $15 discount on a $69.99 pricing for the new E1000.	1
544	"Sure, it is easy to set up."	1
545	"And it does, after a fashion, transfer packets across a wireless-G network"	1
546	Very nice and easy to setup	1
547	Nice futuristic design.	1
548	Looks awesome on the table	1
549	Great compared to my old netgear that did not have support unless you call India call center support and it was not working and no repair	1
550	This router is perfect for my apartment.	1
551	Very easy to set up.	1
552	If I do have any issues they are solved by taking the power cord out and sticking it back in.	1
553	I love how small and flat this router is.	1
554	The Windows 7 routine worked without a problem and in just a couple of mouse clicks a secure network was set up that is working flawlessly.	1
555	The WRT-160n works well and has a greater range than the WRT-150n that it replaced	1
556	"Recommendation: If you have a problem with the Linksys installation software, try the Windows router installation routine."	1
557	The router was very easy to setup.	1
558	"I have both macs and pcs in my house, spread across two floors, and everything works flawlessly."	1
559	I have not had any issues yet.	1
560	"Worked for almost one year, problems start."	1
561	I called Linksys and they provided a software on their website to upload on the router.	1
562	The Cisco-Linksys WRT160N looked good on paper.	1
563	I installed the competitors device today and it was working correctly from the get-go.	1
564	"Moreover, its been up all day and the connection speed seems much faster"	1
565	"The competitors device is cheaper, faster, and far more reliable for my environment"	1
566	"i opened up the box, unpacked it, plugged it in and was done."	1
567	"I have the router in the basement, and my son has is Xbox 360 on the 2nd floor and we get full bars and no lag time playing online!"	1
568	Very strong signal through the basement ceiling and all the way to the 2nd floor.	1
569	I would call that impressive!	1
570	the range is good enough for my home and the speed is up to par.	1
571	"Super easy to install, just insert disc and follow the easy instructions."	1
572	You will be online in no time.	1
573	"Love this product, had been using for a while and have not seen any problem at all, I am strongly recommending to buy it."	1
574	I LOVED ALL THE STUFF I BOUGHT OR WAS FREE.	1
575	"Usually, this router works just fine."	1
576	I use it to support a number of devices in my home and have never had a problem with it dropping connections.	1
577	"Its fine for what it is, and if you can find it cheap, it will do the job."	1
578	This product does exactly what it is supposed to do.	1
579	I am not technologically savvy but I was able to set this up.	1
580	There was a problem with the set up and I was able to call the 800 number and get free assistance.	1
581	if my network had not outgrown this wonderful device i would till be using it thank you linkys for such wonderful products	1
582	This router is the same as the one I replaced due old age.	1
583	This is one of the few refurbished products that I have had good success with.	1
584	"I have purchased at least a dozen of these in the past 6 months and every one has worked great so far with no drop-out, also, the range on this product has been excellent."	1
585	"I highly recommend this router... and for the price, how can you go wrong!"	1
586	I purchased this for someone else to use and I believe it to be just fine as I have heard no complaints.	1
587	"Simple and easy to setup,required only one try."	1
588	Continued using hard wire connection and wireless for remote solar monitoring equipment.	1
589	"Very easy to install, the performance is excellent."	1
590	No complaint with this router	1
591	Cheap and reliable...	1
592	This router is easy to set up--no problem.	1
593	"Well-priced, easy to set up and sleek."	1
594	Installing the router was easy enough.	1
595	"We found out from experience that using the CD was not necessary, that Windows 7 and Vista would let us easily install the router"	1
596	Since installing the new router we have had no problems	1
597	"This router is great, if your machine is connected via ethernet"	1
598	I have no problem connecting and using those same laptops at other locations	1
599	"So far, everything has worked fine."	1
600	"The setup was easy and fast, way better than my previous Linksys G-router."	1
601	Just follow the easy steps including installing the program.	1
602	My computer sees the network and connects to it automatically as it would with any home network configured.	1
603	The movie will take a couple of seconds to start the streaming and play but after that there is absolutely no interruption.	1
604	I bought this product 1 week ago and I installed it without problems.	1
605	"I put the router in a second floor, and it has some range signal in the first floor, therefore I am happy, because I can use my laptop with Internet anywhere in my house."	1
606	I really recommend it.	1
607	it worked well with my XP operating system.	1
608	He told me that the router was easy to set up and to buy a refurbished one because they were just as good.	1
609	He told me that Amazon had the BEST price on this router from another store.	1
610	"Very, very easy to set up with my AT&T DSL modem and my wireless computers, printers and scanners in my office."	1
611	So far the router is working flawlessly so no worries about factory refurbished routers and who does not want to save money nowadays?	1
612	Literally 10 minutes to wireless connectivity.	1
613	I am very happy with my purchase.	1
614	I am not one that knows a lot about electronics and I was able to easily get everything connected and running.	1
615	The Cisco-Linksys WRT160N wireless router was easy to set up and has worked  flawlessly so far.	1
616	"In my opinion, it is an excellent value for the money."	1
617	is also worth purchasing.	1
618	"It enables other devices, such as printers, to be connected wirelessly and to share files among computers on the network."	1
619	This router is faster and has a much more consistent connection.	1
620	Connect speed has consistently been over 110 mbps.	1
621	Signal strength varies according to modem conditions and location of the router.	1
622	The dual band allows for better connect speed as well and no little antennas to deal with.	1
623	"Fantastic easy to install, great coverage, if i could give more than 5 stars for range, I would."	1
624	Everything i need and no complaints.	1
625	"This router gets the job done, looks sleek, and has a nicer smaller wall plug, so it fits in better into my power strip with all the other big plugs."	1
626	Have had no problems with it so far	1
627	The wireless-N capability and decent price made it look like a good investment.	1
628	Set-up with the provided install-disc took less than 10 minutes.	1
629	"The bundled software did a decent job at monitoring network status and providing shortcuts for settings some parameters, but it was hardly necessary."	1
630	"After installing the software, I connected my desktop via ethernet, and all was well."	1
631	"The management page was clean and easy to navigate, and I had a WPA2 wireless network set up in no time."	1
632	Pros -Sleek design; great finish and styling Easy setup; plug and play; no compatibility issues Familiar web interface for configuration Expanded network range	1
633	"And customer service, as nice as they may be, have no solutions."	1
634	"Then, my internet experience is flawless."	1
635	"Overall this item works just fine and I have no complaints, I just gave it 4 stars because to say I love it seems a bit much...I upgraded from a D-link wireless-G router and have been very impressed with the increase in speed on my wireless network."	1
636	"If you just surf the web, etc., this single band router is likely the way to go."	1
637	"This router is fast, 100% reliable and an amazing value for the money, especially for someone like me - I am not an IT person, all I want it to do is to connect a number of laptops to a printer and to the web."	1
638	"I do not care about any extra features, but it must be totally reliable and easy to use because I am 100% dependent on it as I work from home."	1
639	After using this router for about 3 months on a very intense 24-7 basis I can say that it met all my expectations 100%.	1
640	It was very easy to setup and took less than 5 minutes to install.	1
641	I also found the 7 day trial of Cisco Magic Pro software very helpful and will probably purchase that as well.	1
642	"I was concerned about coverage to the basement of the house, but had no issues."	1
643	This router works well... most of the time.	1
644	Unfortunately it is plagued by a sporadic DNS bug as documented here: customer service is frustrating to deal with and unhelpful.	0
645	I highly recommend you do not purchase this router.	1
646	"I waited a while before reviewing this product because i wanted to give it, its chance to shine but its absolutely garbage."	0
647	Always dropping connection and mine its hell to get it working this thing just sucks overall STAY AWAY.	0
648	This is a great router and worked without hassle.	1
649	The software made it easy and it has the regular amount of control you would expect from a router now a days.	1
650	It works so well that I forgot about it.	1
651	I didnt touch it for over a year and only then because I moved.	0
652	I bought 2 of these routers to allow myself to make my home wireless signal a bit more accessible.	1
653	One of them worked perfectly and the other didnt work at all and as they were purchased from an unauthorized dealer there was no warranty.	1
654	"After 1 month the working one still works great, but I had to purchase another of these routers to replace the broken one"	0
655	"This is the first time I have had an issue about an non-working product so I wouldnt use that to deter your purchasing the item, because overall (if they work) they work very well"	1
656	Hope this helps!	0
657	A good item.	1
658	We hooked it up and it simplified all the cords and hookups on my computer.	1
659	Satisfied with this computer gadget.	1
660	I set this router up for a small business and it works great.	1
661	"Fast, secure, and reliable."	1
662	That about says it all!	1
663	"easy install, so far it seems to be matching the performance that was described."	1
664	"As in all things, time is the true test of how well it workds"	1
665	"Easy set-up simply put the disk in, follow directions, print the encryption code and connect!"	1
666	"The range is exceptional, especially in our large home with all the supported electronic devices (laptop, tablet, printers and PC)!"	1
667	This is a great router for the money.	1
668	I bought this because I had its older brother and liked it.	1
669	I now use the older brother as a wireless bridge to my Linux cluster in the basement and my wife is very happy about not having a network cable running across the kitchen floor to the basement anymore.	1
670	"If you have problems with this router, return it and get a new one."	0
671	"When you make thousands of something, there is bound to be a few getting past QC with a flaw or two."	0
672	Just get your new one and enjoy.	0
673	"I cant recall the exact date I bought this (it wasnt off Amazon), but it lasted around one year, then a blip of a power outage fried it."	0
674	It was a decent router while I had it.	1
675	Easy set-up and decent WiFi for my basic needs.	1
676	I did find the WiFi to be slower when trying to stream Netflix via either my old Wii or my new Blu-Ray.	0
677	It would go in and out and was incredibly annoying.	0
678	"Cell phone service w/WiFi was also spotty, connecting, disconnecting over and over."	0
679	"It was great for computers, laptops, and printers, but other devices, not so much."	1
680	"Every time the power went out, even it was for a second, I would have to pull the plug out of the router (that reset button on the front does NOT work), count to 30 and plug it back in."	0
681	Sometimes this would take several tries before it would recognize my cable modem again.	0
682	Setting your name/password to keep your neighbors out was a bit tricky if you dont read the manual or you forget that the pre-set log in and password is always admin for both (usually).	0
683	"If you want a router that has better WiFi and will hopefully last longer than a year, dont buy this one."	0
684	"If you just need a basic WiFi for 1 - 2 computers (no tablets, smartphones, printers, Netflix, etc.), it would probably work fine."	1
685	Maybe plug it into a power surge strip though.	1
686	Ill be buying one for my new router!	0
687	Bought it because - stupid of me - was pretty.	0
688	After 6 months problems cropped up.	0
689	"First my smartphone failed to see the router in the network even though its right beside each other, turns out I needed to reboot the router."	0
690	"Then it reboots itself every 10 minutes or less, thought it was restarting because of the heat but nope."	0
691	"Did a clean reboot, reinstalled the firmware, still restarts every 10 freaking minutes."	0
692	"Called customer service, after navigating their options for 15 minutes and telling the guy on the other end my problem, the first thing he says is is your router properly plugged?, uh yeah, why do you think there are lights blinking?"	0
693	magic?	1
694	"after that episode, gave up the linksys and bought another router from a new company (tenda) with the same specs for 1/5 of the price."	0
695	"am now experimenting if i could use the linksys as a repeater wifi, an expensive repeater might i add."	0
696	Seriously?	1
697	"Ive read some reviews and Ive actually used the damn product, in fact I have it right here with me."	0
698	It decided to quit out on me after about 1yr and a 1/2 after I began to use it.	0
699	Dont buy this product unless youre going to just buy another one a year later anyway.	0
700	But its not worth your money.	1
701	"The connection was pretty cool, but the range was absolutely horrible."	1
702	"I set it up downstairs and the thing reached up to my room on the second floor, but the minute I went outside the door it just all but disappeared."	0
703	I was right on the other side of the wall with my laptop too!	1
704	"My advice, dont waste your money on something thats just going to break on you, buy something worthwhile."	0
705	"Besides, the set up for everything was a pain in the ass, Im used to hooking up computers and such but when I tried this thing it took two hours for the damn connection to come through!"	0
706	It also went out at random times)	0
707	"Called customer service for help on setting up a secure system, was told Id have to pay as it was past warranty......though we verified my purchase of their product."	1
708	"Tried to set up a secure system myself and tho, fairly tech savvy, I gave up after multiple efforts."	1
709	I got rid of this low quality product.	1
710	I now have a much superior Apple Extreme Airport router.	1
711	Ive bought and installed 3 of these over the past 2 years.	0
712	"The first I bought for my home 2 years ago, the second I ordered and installed for a friend who wanted one like mine, and the third I ordered and installed a week ago for a family member"	1
713	The router has issues when used prior to doing the most recent needed firmware updates.	0
714	"All 3 routers, bought at different times over the last 2 years needed to have the updates loaded."	0
715	"Without them, the wireless speeds are slower, connections can be finicky and there is a strange bug these routers suffer from that causes them to have DNS issues (you can read about it on the Cisco-Linksys forums where hundreds of other people have had this issue).After the firmware update however, there is an immediate improvement in speeds and connectivity is not just no longer an issue, but even stronger than ever."	0
716	Where before it seemed like a 50-50 chance if you could even get someone logged into your wireless network.	1
717	"Now after the update, its simple and works every single time."	1
718	Step by step directions on how to do this update can be found on the Linksys website.	0
719	I am very pleased with the Cisco Router I bought from you.	1
720	It was easy to install and has worked great so far.	1
721	The price was excellent as we shopped around before looking at Amazon.	1
722	I think Amazon has great prices on everything we have bought from you!	1
723	I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a router and looking for a great price!	1
724	Cisco-Linksys WRT160N Wireless-N Broadband Router	0
725	"Thank you,Firecracker"	1
726	I bought this planning to flash DD-WRT like so many others have done successfully.	1
727	"When mine arrived, the model number on the back of the unit said v2."	0
728	Only v1 and v3 are supported by DD-WRT	0
729	"Do I tried setting it up with Linksyss firmware to try the router out as is, and I couldnt even get through the browser based setup without it dropping/disconnecting the wireless connection"	0
730	So watch out for the version number that you get.	1
731	Theres probably no way of knowing what youre getting until you open the box.	0
732	Im not tech savvy so when I started thinking about a home network I contacted the computer tech who weve come to rely on for work on my computer.	1
733	I had no clue what to look for or buy.	1
734	He suggested wireless because of the size of our home and said anything by Cisco-Linksys he highly recommended.	1
735	"Well, he was right."	1
736	The system is now up and running and working beautifully - thanks to Cisco-Linksys WRT160N Wireless-N Broadband Router	1
737	"Good price, good product!"	1
738	I highly recommend it.	1
739	This router was easy to set up and configure to my home network needs.	1
740	"However, after about a year, the router has become unstable and randomly freezes."	0
741	Essentially the entire router would suddenly stop routing connections to the internet for no apparent reason (wired and wireless connections are effected).	0
742	"My computer will still be connected to the router, but I wont be able to access the internet."	0
743	"Further, I cant log into the router itself once its in this state."	0
744	The only solution is to reset the entire router by physically unplugging it	0
745	"This happens randomly which is frustrating when I need a constant, reliable connection."	0
746	Worked okay (but not great) for about a year.	1
747	"Occasionally it would fail to connect and Id have to power cycle the router, but only perhaps once a month or so."	0
748	"It has always had inconsistencies in the speed, particularly when more than one device is accessing at the same time."	0
749	"Sometimes it zips along very quickly, and other times slows to almost dialup speeds (I have a 20 Mbps connection)."	0
750	"Its not my ISP, as when the laptop is plugged directly into the wall, I dont have these speed inconsistency issues."	0
751	The last 6 months have been a nightmare.	0
752	I have to unplug it at least once daily when it decides to suddenly stop working.	0
753	Most commonly it decides that my wireless security key is incorrect- although it hasnt changed and my computer and other devices have been set up with the same password since I got this router.	0
754	"It must be power cycled (unplugged, let sit for ten seconds, then plugged back in) before it will recognize the security key again."	1
755	"I tried entirely resetting it and then setting up again with the same key, with no change."	0
756	"As this is the second Linksys wireless router I have had substantial reliability issues with, I wont be buying another of their products."	0
757	Linksys execs should be put in jail for fraud.	0
758	"They have been providing the mass market with a pile of plastic junk that works for awhile, once you get it configured, by yourself, because the included software never works, but will very quickly fail."	0
759	"I know they have plied us with cheap plastic, wired and wireless routers because I have a pile of them in the basement."	0
760	Customer support does not want to help you and tech support hopes that someone smarter than them will post it on the community support pages.	1
761	"That is a pretty good deal for the corporation; market $50 - $100 crap, hope it lasts through the warranty and pray any issues get supported and fixed by YOUR customers on the community support pages."	1
762	I have had the Linksys WRT160Nv3 for almost two years.	0
763	The warranty ended recenty and so did the linksys wrt160nv3(ciso) it first started having connection problem( dropping the movie stations) when I called customer services I was told that the router was out of warranty and that I should buy another because this one could not be repaired.	0
764	I became very upset that I had been used and said things about being cheated.	0
765	But since my call to customer service now the router will not work at all.	0
766	THATS VERY ODD.	0
767	Lo mejor de este router es su precio ... y nada que envidiar a otros en le mismo rango ... super faceil de instalar ... y su conectividad es perfecta ... altamente recomendable	1
768	I really enjoy the Cisco-Linksys WRT160N Wireless-N Broadband Router.	1
769	It allows my family and I to move throughout our home without having to be connected to a main hub and ethernet cords.	0
770	"Also, the delivery of the router from misskrs777 was very prompt."	1
771	The only issue I had was with setting the router up with the cd	0
772	Thankfully a friend of mine was able to set everything up for me and the router has worked fine ever since.	1
773	I was extremely terrified about purchasing this router after reading about all the negative comments.	0
774	But I must say it was a breeze to setup the WRT160N Version 3 it took me less than 5 minutes.	0
775	I also upgrade the unit to the latest firmware.	0
776	"[...]Here is a tip for you guys, if you want to manual configure your WRT160N without use the damn CD.1."	0
777	Plug in your router to the power.2.	0
778	Press the reset button for 30 seconds.3.	0
779	Unplug the power and wait 10 seconds and plug the power back into the WRT160N4.	0
780	Connect a RJ45 cable to the one of the 4 slots at the back of the WRT160N and connect the other end of the RJ45 to your computer or laptop.5.	0
781	Open your favorite browser.6.	0
782	Enter 192.168.1.1 into the web browser7.	0

784	"First thing you want to do is go to Wireless Tab, select Manual9."	0
785	Change the SSID to whatever you want.10.	0
786	I usually change the channel to 11 (this is optional)12.	1
787	"Right under the Wireless Tab, you will see Wireless Security, change security mode to WPA2 personal13."	1
788	enter a passphrase.	0
789	This will be your new password when you try to access your WRT160N.	0
790	"It is highly recommended to use characters like these in your passphrase ( !,@,#,$,,^ and etc) example !swis$cheese2011&These will make your password nearly impossible to hack using China base wireless hacking software."	0
791	I was in China and a friend showed me how easy it was to hack peoples passwords	1
792	Cheers!	0
793	The linksys device is a very good device.	1
794	I like the security feathers on my device and my network.	1
795	One of the feather I like is the network magic.	1
796	It makes you see who are the intruders on your network and when they have connected to your network.	0
797	You can remove the and block from connecting to your network again.	0
798	Another feather is the test your speed system.	1
799	Which help you test your upload and down speeds.	1
800	Also you can test the speed in your area too.	1
801	The linksys makes it so easy to monitor your network anytime.	1
802	it is easy to install and setup.	1
803	What a pain.	0
804	"while easy to set up, it constantly refuses to recognize our wireless devices and causes endless problems."	0
805	i pull it offline many times to connect directly to DSL modem because it fails so frequently.	0
806	im a cisco shareholder but this is one product i hope they deep 6.	0
807	"I have one major problem with this item, it has to be reset at least 3 times per day."	0
808	"If I hadnt waited so long to connect the router, it would have been returned to amazon"	1
809	I have had great luck with all my other linksys items.	1
810	This one is a lemon.	0
811	"This router worked fine for about the first yr that I had it then out of nowhere it started dropping signal or the signal would go from 54 mbps to 11 mbps to 1 mbps, so I would power cycle the router & it would be fine for maybe 10 hrs for it to only do it again."	1
812	Then I would power cycle the router & then I might not have any probs.	0
813	for a couple days then out of nowhere it would do it again & then I would have to power cycle the router several times in one day & then once again no probs for several days to maybe 2 wks to only have it do it again.	0
814	Then recently it is doing it again to where I am having to power cycle it almost every hour & sometimes it wouldnt even come back on.	0
815	I previously had a Belkin G router that lasted 5 yrs before it ever did this & cost 1/4th the priced of this router.	1
816	"This made playing PS3, using Netflix, or even using apps on FB nearly impossible."	0
817	"Now if I power cycle the router, it automatically only goes to 1 mbps & even my desktop which is hardwired has issues even though it says I am connected at 100 mpbs(I know this is not the true speed, but still getting about equal to dial up)."	0
818	"I have tried updating the software & recalling the software, changing the channels, & everything else that I have seen posted online and nothing has worked."	1
819	I would suggest not getting this router unless you plan on buying a new one not long after you purchase this one.	0
820	I got this right when it came out.	1
821	"I was so happy to be getting an N router, but was quickly disappointed when I discovered that despite it being an N router, it was not as good as my previous G+ router for streaming and gaming."	1
822	"If you want to get a router that works really well, get the WRT-400N instead."	1
823	That router is exactly what I hoped this router would have been.	0
824	"The 160N will really frustrate you, if you want to do more than simple Web searches."	0
825	First off I bought it because of the good reviews.	1
826	I have an older model yeah we all know which Linksys Im talking about.	0
827	"Anyway, mine came in earlier than stated"	0
828	"On with the router, well...I havent been able to even use it yet."	0
829	It says just pop in the disc and follow the on screen instructions.	1
830	"Well I did that, but I cannot pass the 4th step after set up."	0
831	For me I keep getting an error.	0
832	"I tried everything of my knowledge to try get it to work, but the error still keeps popping up so I cant use this router...I am using it on a Windows Vista computer too, a Studio 15.5 from dell"	0
833	If anyone knows about this problem please let me know how to fix it...Since I cant use the router...my review is this so far...hopefully I can figure out whats going on to give a full review of my experience when its working...	0
834	In one year I went through:1.Belkin.	0
835	It broke.2.Bought another $50 Belkin to replace the Belkin.	0
836	"It also broke, sent in for a replacement.3.Bought a Linksys."	0
837	Also broke.	0
838	"Used the belkin replacement I had.4.Belkin didnt work out of box, even though it was BRAND NEW.5.Decided not to send anything for 1-year warranty replacement, hammered them down in my kitchen in frustration.6.Told my problems to a best buy seller who told me to buy another linksys and if it failed to install dd-wrt firmware and it would keep it going for the next 3 or 4 years until it broke down naturally."	0
839	I gave in and bought my second linksys.	0
840	Not to my surprise it started dropping connections within 2 months.	0
841	Had to be restarted multiple timees daily.	0
842	"So I flashed it with the free firmware from dd-wrt, and its suddenly been working for one year now"	0
843	in one year I went through 3 belkins.	0
844	2 Linksys.	0
845	Thank god for dd-wrt.	1
846	If this one fails on me Im going for the aiport extreme so that I can connect an external harddrive and make back-ups	0
847	"My question is: if a software upgrade can fix the problem, as dd-wrt did, why are these companies not doing so?"	0
848	Why are they putting out products that are meant to fail?	0
849	There should be a class law suit against these people.	1
850	Had a real headache to set it up but after it was installed it works just fine.	1
851	I think the instructions could have been written better.	1
852	"I have a macbook pro, and I just ignored the set up disc because I had read Terrell Smiths review saying it would not work for a mac anyway."	0
853	His review was helpful and easy to follow so set up was easy.	1
854	Directions for mac should be included in box because it does work w/a mac.	0
855	The range is good and so far the router has had no problems.	1
856	Was having problems with my prior router: It would not consistently reach rooms on the other side of the house.	1
857	I constantly had to reboot my laptop because the networking driver would get garbled.	0
858	The new router solves all of these problems.	0
859	Have been running it now for over a months - and have not had one issue with it!	0
860	When I first purchased my first wireless network it was made from Linksys.	0
861	About month later it stopped working so I purchased this model and it worked fine.	1
862	I moved and reconnected it in my new place and all hell broke loose.	0
863	The router would not allow all the same computers I had at the old place connect to it.	0
864	So I called Linksys for tech support and they wanted to charge me $49.99 for tech support.	1
865	Why pay that and thats what I paid for the router.	0
866	"So I purchased a new one same model and all, and same problem."	0
867	So I called tech support to help with the new unit for free.	1
868	And they had me go into the router through the IP address of the router via my internet browser.	0
869	"Once in we set it up 1,2,3."	0
870	So I pulled my old model out the closet and done the same thing and it worked too.	1
871	And the other one did as well.	1
872	I have an issue with a product shutting down just to get customers to pay for tech support and you can include all of this in the manual.	0
873	This product works good and its interface was easy to use but it did not extend my range within the house that I was looking for.	1
874	I have a large house so the upstairs receives hardly any signal at all.	1
875	I increased my service to gain better speed and added this to extend the range but this did not better the upstairs signal much at all.	1
876	We purchased this router only a couple months ago and it is already not working.	0
877	It wont register there is an internet cable plugged into the port.	1
878	"I tried reseting it, changed ports everything and it still wont work."	1
879	I didnt expect it to last forever but I didnt expect it to go out in a couple months either.	0
880	Before considering this purchase I highly recommend you go to Google and put these words in as a search: WRT160N V3 has serious DNS issues	0
881	"Once you get to Ciscos own forum, you can see just how bad this router is"	0
882	I had to replace mine (with no money back from Cisco--they didnt ever respond to the hundreds of requests for help in their own forums) and left Cisco to get a D-LINK.	0
883	Happy with it	1
884	I was a long time Cisco customer before	0
885	"The issue was that it would sporadically redirect anyone on the network from Facebook, for example, to some other site, like a MySpace page or somewhere else (once I got redirected to a gay bed and breakfast website"	0
886	The only way to fix it is to power off the router.	0
887	Its very frustrating.	0
888	Who knows what kind of a security leak that thing has.	0
889	Some of the included software wouldnt load.	1
890	Dont know if it an OS conflict (WIN7) or not	0
891	Easy to set up and the range is excellent	1
892	I like it.	1
893	I was told that all I had to do was unplug my modem and plug in the router.	0
894	Its not quite that easy.	1
895	"After having my daughter in law talk me through plugging it into the computer and modem (I had to keep the modem), it still did not work."	0
896	I then called the products customer service and even that lady was on the phone for an hour with me sorting out why it would not work.	0
897	Had to change a setting on this computer which was an odd one.	0
898	"Since then, however its been a dream."	0
899	I wanted to be able to upload books to my  Kindle without going to our local library to use their wifi.	1
900	Its wonderful to sit in my own living room and buy books.	1
901	Id recommend it to anyone thinking of going wifi.	1
902	THIS ROUTER SUCKS A FAT ONE!	0
903	"I have 20MBPS service, and it often slows down to 1mbps, and when I say often I mean all the time."	0
904	"I try to reset it, call custo service, but no avail."	0
905	This router is absolute garbage.	0
906	Id rather give my 50 bucks to someone to kick me in the junk and get the pain overwith rather than the slow frustration that this thing causes me.	0
907	I want to kill it office space style.	0
908	probably going for a dlink.	1
909	This product work is one of the worst Ive bought.	0
910	"I own it, I paid a crapload and all it did was make me hate Linksys like I hate HP."	0
911	How many times have I reset my server or reconnected my connection?	0
912	Countless.	1
913	"Meaning, buy this but know it is a living pain in the ass especially if you want to download anything that is a sizable download as you WILL 100 percent lose your connection and thus the box of this product should simply read bonus: will cause you subtle stress, enjoy!."	0
914	I dont stress about it anymore.	0
915	I simply accept it but its like accepting that you have Herpes or a wife that loathes you.	1
916	It just is what it is.	0
917	Thank you Linksys for creating a truly crappy product and if you worked on this product as a designer all I can say is your a truly untalented and stupid person whose work did nothing but make many other people unhappy.	0
918	You probably should have simply trafficked in human slavery or drugs and would have at least made more money but produced the same human misery	0
919	"To make my point, in the time it took to write this review my linksys stopped working."	0
920	I purchased this router to replace an older Linksys router that mysteriously started resetting itself to defaults for no reason.	0
921	"So far, this router has been perfectly reliable"	1
922	"I am tech-savvy, but a fairly light-weight user."	1
923	Since the initial install I havent been back into the config for much of anything.	0
924	It just works.	1
925	"I dont have to power cycle it for no reason, and I havent had to update its firmware in some futile attempt to fix one glitch or another."	0
926	It just sits there and works.	1
927	Like it should	1
928	"The range is good enough that my outdoor WiFi security camera works well, and the speed is good enough for streaming HD video"	1
929	And it doesnt look half bad.	0
930	I have owned this router (version 1) for about a 1-1/2 years now.	0
931	"When I first purchased it a year ago, the firmware was pretty lousy."	0
932	It seemed like it constantly had to be reset otherwise it would get really slow.	0
933	I stopped using it for a while when I had switched to DSL and ended up using a 2wire gateway instead	0
934	I have recently switched back to cable internet and am now using this router again in conjunction with a Motorola Surfboard SB6120.	0
935	I put DD-WRT firmware on it to try it out but then ended up using the newest Linksys firmware update instead.	0
936	"I must say, I saw no improvement with the DD-WRT firmware over the latest Linksys firmware."	0
937	"So far with the newest Linksys firmware its been stable, range seems better, it hasnt had to be reset, and works great with the new Motorola cable modem."	1
938	"I use it with two laptops, and an Xbox 360 hardwired to it."	1
939	"Works great with the Xbox, set up port forwarding, and have not had any NAT issues."	1
940	After I read the reviews.	0
941	I thought I was making a mistake buying this.	0
942	But I got it and it works amazingly!	1
943	Highly recommended	1
944	This is for those who had bad experience.	0
945	Remember this is an electronic.	1
946	They have a high fail rate no matter who makes it.	0
947	You can get 10000 good ones in a row and have 1 bad one.	0
948	LOVE THIS PRODUCT.	1
949	Worth every penny.	0
950	I have game systems and multiple laptops and absolutely no issue.	0
951	Installation was a breeze and Im very pleased with this purchase.	1
952	Id recommend it to anyone with a home network or small office in need of a compact yet powerful router	1
953	My only issue with it is that the frequency throws off my Nintendo 64 game system.	0
954	I have to keep it 2 ft away for it to play.	1
955	"For those with older game systems, keep them away from your routers if you want them to play!"	0
956	I will never throw away my money on Linksys again.	0
957	Overpriced with marginal signal range.	0
958	Every router I have owned from Linksys magically quits working one year after the warranty expires.	0
959	In order to get it working again you have to call their customer service department whcih charges you $40 to walk you through the set up again.	0
960	"Even though their CS is efficient in getting your router back up and running, it will not only cost you money, it will cost you time because you will be on the phone for hours, these people are like monkeys on drugs or foreign robots!"	1
961	Yes Comcast is overpriced but they were able to supply me with a router with better range and faster speeds for $10.	1
962	Plus they offer free support on the router for as long as I have my internet through them.	1
963	My last Linksys router made it to the garbage but not before I beat the living $^*#^& out of it with a hammer!	0
964	If I could give this ZERO stars I would but I guess the lowest you can go is ONE star.	0
965	"The router was easy to set up; most of the time give adequate signal, but some time give very low signal."	1
966	Also there is the parental control work well need to re-adjust otherwise block lots email from coming in	1
967	Newman	0
968	"Got this router,looks nice,but unreliable,sometimes when i want to connect to facebook it takes me to myspace,and its a big problem with this router you can check on the linksys forum."	0
969	"Sometimes it would put out a signal but i still can connect to it,another problem you can see all over the internet."	0
970	"In short,when it works,works great,when it doesnt sucks real bad,so im looking for a new router and i bought this in novemeber of 2010 thanx linksys for no firmware update and just selling shottie products"	0
971	"Although Cisco deleted my posts on their board, I had TWO of these die after 9 months"	0
972	March 2010 = Purchased new (from Amazon)July 2010 = Started having wireless radio issues (long time to connect on 2010 Lenovo ThinkPad and late-2009 Acer Aspire - both with Windows 7 Professional); forced reconnect; cleared firmware settings; reinstalled firmware twiceAugust 2010 = Started dropping BlackBerry and iPod Touch / iPhone clientsNovember 2010 = Installed updated firmwareJanuary 2011 = opened case with technical support.	1
973	No help	1
974	February 2011 = gave up.	0
975	Will not purchase from Cisco China Goods ever again.	0
976	"If you are looking for a router whose wireless rarely works, pre-sets parental controls making the internet nearly unusable and then requires you to register with linksys to change, randomly diverts you to other pages (type in facebook, sends you to myspace), is extraordinarily slow even when hardwired, charges you for customer support, and needs to be rebooted once per day in order to function, then this is the router for you."	0
977	"Avoid the pain, annoyance, frustration, and lack of function."	0
978	I cannot recommend this router to anyone.	1
979	"The included software, which is useless, doesnt work."	0
980	"At random times, it just shuts down, or stops broadcasting a connection."	0
981	"I get constant error messages, such as 404 - Not Found, or DNS errors, and Ive tried everything Ive found to try and fix it."	0
982	Linksys Support is absolutely no help.	0
983	Their representatives know absolutely nothing and put you on hold for extreme amounts of time	1
984	Overall Im simply not a happy user.	1
985	"sets up easy with modem and wireless laptop, but a real pain to set up with ipod and kindle."	1
986	instructions are poor and the shareware is only good for a 10 day trial	0
987	This router simply cannot handle a Mac and a PC connected simultaneously.	0
988	Ive flashed the firmware I dont know how many times.	0
989	The thing simply craps out.	0
990	"And if it doesnt, network speed is ATROCIOUS."	0
991	I think quite a few people had this problem (I have v3).	0
992	"It worked a bit better when computers of the same operating system were connected, but it would still crash occasionally."	1
993	I tried to contact customer support and they were utterly useless.	0
994	Made me send my model number three times and gave me canned responses.	0
995	DO NOT BUY THIS.	1
996	I hear DLinks are better for cross-OS connection.	1
997	"Apple routers (in my experience) have been pretty stable also, but you Windoze fanboys might not like to hear that."	1
998	"Like others, Ive had many problems with the router."	0
999	"I was hoping that going to DD-WRT would make things better (I wasnt afraid to dabble in that), but unfortunately it just lead to more headaches."	0
1000	"Ive decided to ditch this router and go with something newer ... looks like there are N-routers that are just as cheap, and hopefuly they wont be as problematic."	0
1001	Purchased the WRT160N V3 and installed at my in-laws house.	0
1002	Unfortunately by the time we really used that much it was almost out of warranty.	0
1003	Immediately upon using this router we started having Invalid URL problems on our wireless laptop and computer.	0
1004	I  called Linksys while it was still covered under warranty and  complained of invalid URLs.	0
1005	"They pointed the blame to the router, my new computer, etc., until the router was out of warranty."	0
1006	"The invalid URLs were so bad ~ I couldnt use the web, mail, the laptop, or main computer .."	0
1007	I finally had to connect the computer directly into the modem and threw away this horrible router.	0
1008	I finally did some research and found that Invalid URLs plague this router.	0
1009	I suggest you google this router and Invalid URLs before you purchase....	0
1010	Really easy set-up.	1
1011	The software walks you through the whole thing.	0
1012	I use it in quite a small area so not sure how extensive the range is.	1
1013	I was able to connect my iPod Touch 2nd generation without any problems.	0
1014	PCs connected without any problem.	0
1015	Very happy with the product.	1
1016	This device out of the box for me was a pain.	0
1017	I could hardly connect any of my devices easily and connections often dropped and froze.	0
1018	I was to the point where I was just going to return the product and give up.	0
1019	"After a lot of pain and suffering, I decided to do a little research on the issues I was having with this product."	0
1020	I found out that the hardware in the device is not to blame but it was the firmware that has many issues and limited compatibility	0
1021	"Just to clarify, THIS CAN EASILY BE FIXED."	0
1022	This can be done by flashing the DD-WRT firmware for this particular router on the DD-WRT website.	0
1023	"By doing so, how the router operates is completely re-worked for the better and drastically increases this devices performance and usability."	1
1024	"After flashing DD-WRT, I noticed faster speeds, better range, all devices connected accordingly, and no dropped or frozen connections"	1
1025	For those needing help I will list steps that can be taken to upgrade this routers firmware.1.	0
1026	Google DD-WRT and it will be the first link on the page.2.	0
1027	On the DD-WRT homepage click Router Database3.	1
1028	In the search bar type in the model number for this router which happens to be WRT160N.	0
1029	A list will show up showing revisions of this router and BE SURE TO MATCH the revision you see on the page with the number underneath the router (E	0
1030	g.	1
1031	"WRT160N v1.0, v1.1, v2.0 or v3.0)."	0
1032	NOTE: v2.0 is not supported.4.	0
1033	Click whichever revision matches your router.5.	0
1034	A list of files will appear that you will need to download.	0
1035	Download the file that contains Nokaid in the filename and the file that ends in mini	0
1036	bin.6.	0
1037	"Open your routers homepage which can be done my opening your internet browser(Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome) and typing 192.168.1.1 but this can differ."	0
1038	"Alternatively, you can find your router in devices and right click the router icon and click and open homepage."	1
1039	You will need to enter the username and password for the router which by default is username admin and password admin.7.	0
1040	Once you do this you can access the routers settings and locate the tab/sub tab to update firmware.	0
1041	Sorry I dont have access to the interface.)8.	0
1042	"Once you find the firmware update tab, there should be an empty box in which you can browse and select a file to update the router."	0
1043	Remember those files you downloaded earlier?	0
1044	Well now its time to use them.	1
1045	FIRST browse and select the file containing Nokaid and hit update or whatever the button says in order to upgrade the firmware.9.	0
1046	Let the router do its thing and it might restart a few times.10.	0
1047	"After the router is finished updating, access the routers homepage again by opening your browser and entering 192.168.1.1 in the address bar and entering the username and password."	1
1048	"Once you login, you should notice that the interface looks different but dont let that distract you, look for the upgrade firmware tab again and this time upload the file containing mini"	0
1049	bin.	0
1050	Let the router do its thing again and that should be it	0
1051	Those are 10 easy steps to avoid hassle and spending 100 dollars more on a router that doesnt do much more.	0
1052	"If you have trouble, please comment and I will do my best to answer promptly."	1
1053	"If you get everything to work, take the router for a test drive and let me know how it works for you."	1
1054	"Dont let the 1 star reviews deter you away from this product, they are usually amateurs that dont like to troubleshoot problems and are willing to pay extra for convenience."	0
1055	This router is amazing once you follow my steps provided and hopefully it works for those of you who try this!	1
1056	These steps shouldnt take any more than 20-30 minutes if you follow the steps correctly.	0
1057	Please take time to read carefully because you stand the chance of bricking(breaking) the device if you flash the wrong files to your router.	0
1058	I had some difficulty at first because i had a router set up already but once I figured out what I was doing wrong it has been working just fine.	0
1059	:-)	0
1060	"I am on my third one of these WRT160N routers, they are easy to set-up and configure, but the new design makes these things run too hot and when they get hot they stop working reliably"	1
1061	"I have mine set-up in a closet that allows it to be in reach of 7 wireless components, including an XBox360, WII, Nintendo DS and DSi, Two laptops and a remote desktop."	1
1062	In order for it to work reliably I have it propped up on 2 high blocks and have a fan blowing on it constantly.	1
1063	The refurb units last as good as the new one did.	1
1064	I wanted to use this router as a wireless access point to extend my network.	1
1065	"After way too much time, I discovered that the hardware can do the job, but the firmware it is running from Linksys wont allow it."	0
1066	"So I had to upgrade the firmware to dd-wrt v.24, then find a tutorial on how to set up the access point and eventually got it running."	0
1067	"Even as a techie, this was way more than I had bargained for and took way too long."	0
1068	"Why build a product that has built in features, only to cripple it to have less capability?"	1
1069	I guess they learned that trick from Mr. Gates.	0
1070	So in the end the hardware might be 5 stars but the firmware only 1 star.	0
1071	Highly recommended especially for novices who simply want wireless in their house.	1
1072	Im Glad i bought this product.	1
1073	"Its amazing it got the look, and the use."	1
1074	I mean i can get 1001520712554f the usage of this.	0
1075	"I do the printing, I use the Wifi from my blackberry, and i can get online from any spot of my house with my laptop."	1
1076	Just great.	1
1077	"When it works, it works."	1
1078	"But I get a TON of DNS problems, and have to reset the adapter constantly."	0
1079	"Every once in a while, take a good look at your Sunday newspaper inserts."	1
1080	Thats where we found Amazon offering the ROKU 2050x for a very reasonable price.	1
1081	Did some research on ROKUs website and the WRT160N was tested for compatibility.	0
1082	I have the WRT 160N V3 device.	0
1083	My office and the router are upstairs and the ROKU is in my media room downstairs.	1
1084	"Quick connection, no problems and superior picture."	0
1085	"For about 100 bucks, you cant beat the deal."	0
1086	Wish I had known Cisco wants extra money for Cisco Network Magic Pro 5.5.	1
1087	A little sneaky Cisco.	0
1088	Thats why only 4 stars!!!!	1
1089	Streaming video is the BOMB.	0
1090	Dont buy this POS.	0
1091	I got one to replace a D-Link that finally died during a power-cycle.	0
1092	It had lasted over 5 years.	0
1093	"I got this CISCO at costco, and it lasted about 5 months."	1
1094	"I found I could only run in B-G mode without recycling it at least once a day, otherwise it dropped all connections and failed to respond."	0
1095	Since I was only using B-G devices that was okay.	1
1096	Today it stopped making the handshake to my old Motorola cable-modem.	1
1097	"Modem is fine, bypassing the router worked, so then I checked the router."	1
1098	"Would not handshake the modem, even after a complete reset."	0
1099	"Fortunately, I bought it from costco and they took it back without question"	1
1100	"If you must use this router, dumb down the software to B-G only and expect a brief life before complete failure."	0
1101	I bought this wireless router almost 3 years ago and have not had any problems with it.	0
1102	Great product!	1
1103	"It took me two complete evenings to set it up for connection to iMac, iBook, XP and iPad."	0
1104	"In the end, the link is keeping dropping, and extremely slow."	0
1105	I studied networking in school and considered myself knowledge on the subject.	1
1106	"I must say the router was awfully made, i am wondering where is the drive to excellence spirit in cisco nowadays?"	0
1107	"I installed it in just a couple of clicks, it has a bug trying to get the connection the first time but I think it was the Windows OS"	0
1108	"Its a great product, once installed, I connected my cell phone and my laptops in just a click and the speed is phenomenal."	1
1109	I got WRT160N V3 together with Cox cable service	0
1110	"It worked OK for 6 months, then it started to have troubles switching on:lights just blinked forever unless I re-connect power"	0
1111	"I installed the latest firmware, but the start-up problem didnt go away"	0
1112	Instead I started to have troubles with wireless connection from my laptops	0
1113	"So I switched to DLink DIR-601 instead, let me see."	0
1114	I bought this to replace the WRT54G because I needed a longer range.	0
1115	There seems to be no difference between the two.	1
1116	Its very easy to set up and use.	1
1117	Other than the range I like it very much!	1
1118	"Great router, i run my ps3 wii two computers and now my sat receiver."	1
1119	"Its my second one, lightning fried first but it does everything i need."	0
1120	"Easy set up, great range and speed!"	1
1121	For 44 bucks try it out (it sells in Walmart	0
1122	com for 79).	1
1123	Arrived at the house in one and a half days.	1
1124	Please note: the only thing I use the wireless for is an iPad and a laptop.	1
1125	Im going to try to hook up the wii but havent gotten a chance yet.	1
1126	I bought one of these two years ago an now that I want to hook it up to a new laptop it didnt accept my code.	0
1127	The customer support chat told me that I couldnt get free chat support because the item is no longer under warrany.	1
1128	They want $29.95 to help fix the problem.	0
1129	They can kiss my.... Never mind !	0
1130	I bought a new NetGear unit that has a lifetime warranty.	0
1131	I will never buy another Cisco product!!	0
1132	"Okay, they will help you set up the router if you need help."	1
1133	"That is nice, but buyer beware!!"	0
1134	"My router is only 2 years old, and I called for help because I needed ports opened on the router to use my new PS3 wireless capabilities (for streaming Netflix)."	0
1135	"I called my router company (per Sonys instructions)Cisco Linksys to get the ports open, and they would open the ports needed...for $29.95 (or somewhere in that ballpark)."	0
1136	The customer service is hard to understand (outsourced from another country I suspect).	0
1137	"They tell you that you can do it yourself, however I didnt have the admin code and passcode required to get in the system to make changes myself."	0
1138	"I suppose if you are a computer progammer this will be okay, you will know your way around, but if you are the average Jane you will be screwed."	0
1139	I can pay $30 every time I need help after my first year or...buy another router.	0
1140	"It works well, but if you buy an updated device after the first year you have the router and need help (like needing ports opened on your router, as was my case) they will only help you for a hefty fee."	1
1141	Buyer beware.	0
1142	I am using this router for 1.5 year and I have not any problem until now.	0
1143	Very good router for its price.	1
1144	First time I have tried setting up a wireless router.	0
1145	I did research trying to find the best one for my home needs.	1
1146	This one surpassed my expectations.	0
1147	It was easy for me to set up.	1
1148	And it gives me great range.	1
1149	I have it on the second floor.	1
1150	It streams movies downstairs with no problems at all.	0
1151	Very glad that I bought it.	1
1152	I bought this product from Amazon in Dec 2009.	1
1153	"The wired connections work great, but the WiFi is flaky."	1
1154	"When the WiFi works it is fast, but I have to reset the router every 2-3 days to make sure that my wireless devices can connect."	1
1155	"I have tried many suggestions I found on Amazon as well as other forums, but to no avail."	1
1156	Id stick to a DLink/Netgear for Home Office networking in the future.	0
1157	Fairly easy to set up.	1
1158	Promotional software is helpful but is only a trial so what appears to be something special is actually extra.	1
1159	"While range is supposedly enhanced, I can tell no difference."	1
1160	The N speed is nice for my wife who has that capability built into her laptop.	1
1161	Seems to need fewer occasional resets to keep it alive than most routers.	0
1162	The router was very easy to install.	1
1163	The walk through instructions were very clear.	1
1164	You need to know a little bit about your internet connection but thats readily available through your provider hopefully.	1
1165	Setting it up was fast and easy!	1
1166	NOT happy with this product	1
1167	"slower than my G router (also linksys)took forever to set up , and more than 2 hours on the phone with linksysfinally working, and SLOWER than my old router"	0
1168	"I wanted to get my old router back on my network, and it would work anymoreAsked linksys to help me set back up the old router so I could return the new one....and..... they said the old one in out of warranty and wouldnt help me without charging a fee...which I refuse to pay... so Im stuck with this crummy router"	0
1169	No more LInksys for me....  when I have time Im moving over to another brand.	0
1170	Ive had this router for about a year now.	0
1171	"It looks good, runs cool, has blinking lights"	1
1172	"I dont use the software or the wi-fi protected setup, that seems to be the part people have mot of their problems with."	0
1173	I dont bother calling technical support.	0
1174	I just login to the router with the 192.168.1.1 and setup the wpa2 security/password.	0
1175	Something most people dont do to increase their security is turn off the SSid broadcast.	1
1176	"Your network is then hidden from others, all they see is wireless network, they have to guess the name before they cold even attempt to access it."	0
1177	Pick a random wacky name/number combo and your good	1
1178	I have the following connected:-wired PS3/Xbox360/PC/Roku/AV Receiver-wireless Laptop X 2/Wii/Android phonePROs- I stream Netflix/ and surf the web heavily and get 20+ mbps download speeds.	1
1179	"I play online games with no issues, make phone calls with google phone."	0
1180	It has given me no issues when it is working properly	0
1181	Cons- It needs to be power cycled on occasion.	0
1182	"When I notice things moving a little sluggishly, I reboot it, maybe every 3-4 months?"	0
1183	"BUT, how often do you reboot your PC?"	0
1184	"About a month ago the reboot didnt fix it, so I reset the router, then setup the security again."	0
1185	"It has been working fine since, I have been streaming LOTS of netflix and surfing lots of WWW and it hasnt had an issue since"	0
1186	Overall I am satisfied with this router.	1
1187	Its not perfect but its better then the alternatives from Belkin/D-Link/Netgear.	1
1188	"It seems each of those has a major issue, or maybe its just that people dont know what they are doing."	0
1189	Maybe half are broken and half work fine witch all of the reviews for this router seem to suggest.	0
1190	THe network magic does not allow me to use the features.	1
1191	You are better off with the free version because customer service is almost not there.	1
1192	I purchased this router back in March 2010.	1
1193	It was easy to setup and works well.	1
1194	No dropped connections at all	0
1195	I have had problems with my previous routers.	0
1196	I remember re-booting them everyday.	1
1197	Now I dont even remember the last time I re-booted this one !I would recommend this product to anyone looking for peace of mind ..	1
1198	I needed a new router and went with Linksys since I had one before.	0
1199	I was unable to set it up myself but the Linksys tech was very nice and patient with me.	1
1200	We got it set up it is working great.	1
1201	Hi - decided to drop a few lines and hopefully save some headache to potential new buyers of this brick of an equipment.	0
1202	Unfortunately I ended up buying this router after reading the reviews on Amazon.	0
1203	Lots of people complained about its unreliability however few people mentioned that with the DD-WRT software the router would work fine.	0
1204	Anyhow...I bought it and initially installed it with the default Linksys firmware.	0
1205	The router was running super slow via wi-fi.	1
1206	With direct connect cable speed was OK but via Wi-Fi it was unbelievably slow.	0
1207	So I decided to upgrade the firmware to DD-WRT.	0
1208	After installing this firmware the change in speed was dramatic - as good as with direct connection via LAN cable.	1
1209	Unfortunately the router started dropping connections all the time.	0
1210	I fiddled with multiple settings based on recommendations I found online however no luck.	1
1211	This router is a piece of junk and to save your time and money....DO NOT BUY IT.	0
1212	I personally find the time spent trying to fix this junk more valuable than the $ spent.	0
1213	"Cisco tries to force  its software for management, not good to do that."	0
1214	Wireless stability not good.	1
1215	"Much, much better the Linksys 54 G"	1
1216	This is a good router and gr8 value for money but..the firmware should be upgraded as soon as you get it since i encountered alot of issues with the old firmware.	0
1217	"After the upgrade, router had solid performance..no complains thus far..UPDATE: router started dropping connections so i installed dd-wrt firmware and its better than ever..no probs and incresed range and speed."	0
1218	DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT	1
1219	"I purchased one over a year ago and since last month, it started randomly dropping connections."	0
1220	Very annoying.	0
1221	Only solution is to restart the router.	0
1222	"Customer Support tried to help out but, at the end they decided to send me an older version"	0
1223	So KEEP AWAY from this product.- A very unhappy WRT160N v3 user.	0
1224	This has to be by far the WORST product I ever purchased (next to Belkin) for a router...It drops wireless conections like Iron Man drops bad guys....very lousy range and signal strength...Bring back the antennas...How do you expect to get any range with no external antennas and 1/8th of a watt power??	0
1225	This was the second Cisco refurbished I bought.	0
1226	NONE of them worked properly.	1
1227	"First one died, second one was unstable."	0
1228	Switched this N router for an old linksys G and internet is stable and running 10 times better.	1
1229	Dont buy this item.	0
1230	"I love the Router, I didnt like the fact that when I bought it, It wasnt restored to the factory settings so I had to figure that out while having the previous owners password and username on there, After about an hour I figured it out, Works great for what I needed it for, Im running a laptop and a ps3, The Laptop is my media server for the ps3 and I havnt had a problem with it, I dont know about running lots of things off of it but for what I needed it for I cant complain, And Especially when it came to the price, Cant beat it"	1
1231	I bought this via Amazon and have had it for a few weeks now.	1
1232	"Set up was a snap, just plugged it in to the wall/modem and navigated to the home IP address, where I set the name and password."	0
1233	"For a simple home network, what else do you need?This router replaced a very old router that was humming when plugged in, and had been heat-stained from white to yellow."	0
1234	"It was having shoddy performance, and replacing it with this router made a world of difference."	0
1235	"This routers wireless performance is very bad: slow speed, dropped connection frequently."	0
1236	"After one year, it is completely dead."	0
1237	"When I contacted Linksys customer service, I was told its no longer supported."	0
1238	This router does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it well.	1
1239	Ive had it hooked up for a couple of weeks now and its working just fine with both my primary laptop and my supplemental one.	1
1240	"If youre looking for an inexpensive router, this is a good one to get."	1
1241	I bought a new one.	0
1242	it works well as a wired router	1
1243	"I usually use my laptop, few meters away from the router (same floor).But the wireless signals disconnect very often."	0
1244	The wireless signallasts possibly for few minutes in the worst situation.	0
1245	I bought this router after trying two others.	0
1246	"It was the only one with sufficient range to reach a repeater through solid masonry walls so that my entire apartment had WiFi coverage, and the only one that maintained a constant connection with the repeater (the Netgear and 2Wire routers I had tried previously simply couldnt stay connected to a repeater)."	1
1247	"Yes, the WRT160N did drop connections with clients until I upgraded the firmware to the latest version."	0
1248	"With that problem solved, it appears to be rock-solid in performance."	0
1249	I bought this router as company refubished.	0
1250	Within four months time it stoped working.	0
1251	When I contacted the customer support they told to upgrade the firm ware and asked to pay $30 for that.	1
1252	I bought a new router for $29 from another company and it serves my requirement.	0
1253	I purchased this product to replace an older Linksys router that finally died.	0
1254	The router does not come with much documentation but fortunately does not need much.	1
1255	The vital information that the documentation leaves out is the administrator password.	1
1256	"Fortunately, having owned Linksys before, I know the defaults."	0
1257	This information is also available on the Linksys/Cisco web site FAQs for the device.	1
1258	"If you dont know, the default administrator password is admin."	0
1259	Linksys still uses 192.168.1.1 as its default address.	0
1260	You will need to know that too.	1
1261	This is how you configure the router	0
1262	"After getting logged in, I set up the SSID and turned off SSID broadcast for the wireless."	1
1263	I then configured my Wireless security features.	1
1264	Nice to see this one now supports WPA2.The one thing that was different from my old router is this one has a power switch located in the middle of of the LED indicators.	1
1265	"As the unit is all black, it is a little hard to see."	0
1266	"But if your power LED is blinking, then you are not yet in the ON state"	0
1267	Installation was flawless and quick.	1
1268	I had a Linksys WRT160Nv2 for almost two years and it worked great.....until tonight.	1
1269	"I upgraded my firmware (v2.0.02) preloaded, with the v2.0.03 from the Linksys website, and it killed my router."	0
1270	I was on the phone with CISCO/Linksys Support for almost an hour and could not connect to the router at all.	0
1271	I had to purchase a new E1000.	0
1272	I was provided a $15 discount on a $69.99 pricing for the new E1000.	1
1273	Puts a whole new meaning to firmware upgrade.	0
1274	Proceed with caution.	1
1275	This router is HORRIBLE	0
1276	"Sure, it is easy to set up."	1
1277	"And it does, after a fashion, transfer packets across a wireless-G network"	0
1278	"But dont try to transfer large files!For example, I have a few TIVOs in my house, and I transfer entire programs and movies from one TIVO to another (in another room).All works well for a few minutes, and then the router stalls."	1
1279	It stops transferring packets	0
1280	"The only solution is to power it down, let it cool, and start again."	0
1281	"If you are lucky, you might get the entire file transferred."	1
1282	But dont hold your breath	0
1283	"Now, I thought I just bought a particularly bad router; a lemon per se."	0
1284	So I bought a second.	0
1285	Same problems.	0
1286	At least I got a refund for the second one	1
1287	So do yourself a favor and stay away from this router.	1
1288	It is only good for a landfill.	1
1289	Very nice and easy to setup	1
1290	Nice futuristic design.	1
1291	Looks awesome on the table	1
1292	I got slower download speeds from this router than when I bypassed it and connected directly thru my dsl modem.	0
1293	After about a year the thing started to fail.	0
1294	"After a month of trouble, I called Cisco."	0
1295	"It was out of warranty by 4 (yes, four) days and they refused to do anything about it."	0
1296	Theres a reason this router has so many 1 star ratings.	1
1297	"As for Ciscos customer service, its not really a service at all."	0
1298	Great compared to my old netgeat that did not have support unless you call India call center support and it was not working and no repair	1
1299	This router is perfect for my apartment.	1
1300	Very easy to set up.	1
1301	If I do have any issues they are solved by taking the power cord out and sticking it back in.	0
1302	I love how small and flat this router is.	1
1303	I replaced a WRT-150n that was beginning to work erratically with a new WRT-160n.	1
1304	"Over several days trying to install the router (both on Mac and Windows) without ever getting to the point where the installation could find the router, I called Linksys tech support."	0
1305	After two hours on the phone with a technician and providing access by the technician to my computer there was still no way that the router could be installed with the software provided with the router	1
1306	After reading several comments on Amazon I decided to just plug in the router and install it using the Windows 7 installation routine.	0
1307	The Windows 7 routine worked without a problem and in just a couple of mouse clicks a secure network was set up that is working flawlessly.	1
1308	The WRT-160n works well and has a greater range than the WRT-150n that it replaced	1
1309	"Recommendation: If you have a problem with the Linksys installation software, try the Windows router installation routine."	0
1310	The router was very easy to setup.	1
1311	"I have both macs and pcs in my house, spread across two floors, and everything works flawlessly."	1
1312	I havent had any issues yet.	0
1313	I bought this router few years age.	0
1314	"Worked for almost one year, problems start."	0
1315	"Disconnecting every 10 minutes, and I had to restart the router every time."	0
1316	I called Linksys and they provided a software on their website to upload on the router.	0
1317	"The problem was solved for a year, then started again."	0
1318	"I called them again, this time they asked for $15 to fix the problem."	0
1319	"I rejected the offer, since I had to pay them $15 every year to fix the problem."	0
1320	"I tried to upload the software from their website again, but the software did not help to redeem the problem."	0
1321	"This router is the worst router I had, I bought it for almost $100CAD, but it wasnt worth a penny.+ had a good range.- disc every 10 min, you have to pay Cisco to get the instruction to solve the issue (they may resolve it for a year, then you have to contact them again, and again), too expensive"	0
1322	"Not Recommended at all, since you have to spend money on it every year."	0
1323	The Cisco-Linksys WRT160N looked good on paper.	1
1324	"However, I was getting Cannot connect to WRT160N with WPA errors on two separate Windows 7 laptop machines located within a very strong signal strength distance."	0
1325	"I spent considerable time looking through the manufacturers support forum and found some complex instructions that had me changing beacon thresholds, fragmentation thresholds, and RTS thresholds."	0
1326	"After making this complex sequence of adjustments, I was able to connect with both the Windows 7 machines."	0
1327	"However, the connections would intermittently drop and then have trouble reconnecting"	0
1328	"After a while, I gave up this WRT160N and purchased a cheaper device from a competitor."	1
1329	I installed the competitors device today and it was working correctly from the get-go.	1
1330	"Moreover, its been up all day and the connection speed seems much faster"	1
1331	"In summary, the Cisco-Linksys WRT160N was a waste of my time and money."	0
1332	"The competitors device is cheaper, faster, and far more reliable for my environment"	1
1333	YMMV.	0
1334	my cable company came to set up my internet.	1
1335	"i opened up the box, unpacked it, plugged it in and was done."	1
1336	I didnt even use the cd that came with it!!	0
1337	"i must add that i have not set up the security yet, but i have no one near my house within 500 yards, so i was not too concerned about it"	0
1338	"Not sure how hard that is, will edit this review when i do it."	0
1339	"I have the router in the basement, and my son has is Xbox 360 on the 2nd floor and we get full bars and no lag time playing online!"	1
1340	Very strong signal through the basement ceiling and all the way to the 2nd floor.	1
1341	I would call that impressive!	1
1342	i will tell anyone who needs a wireless router to get this one.	1
1343	"Like the subject says, ive had this router in my home for years and havent had a single issue."	0
1344	the range is good enough for my home and the speed is up to par.	1
1345	"Super easy to install, just insert disc and follow the easy instructions."	1
1346	You will be online in no time.	0
1347	:D	1
1348	"Love this product, had been using for a while and havent seen any problem at all, Im strongly recommending to buy it."	0
1349	I LOVED ALL THE STUFF I BOUGHT OR WAS FREE.	1
1350	I HATE WRITING THIS REVEIW WITH YOU MAKING ME WRITE NINETEEN WORDS.	0
1351	I HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO.	1
1352	"Usually, this router works just fine."	1
1353	I use it to support a number of devices in my home and have never had a problem with it dropping connections.	0
1354	The big problem is with its DNS caching.	0
1355	Google WRT106N DNS issues and youll find some threads on Linksys/Ciscos website about this.	0
1356	This was never fixed in the latest firmware and continues to be an issue	0
1357	"Youll most likely set this router up to use DHCP, so that it automatically assigns an address and some other information to any device that connects to it."	0
1358	"When you do this, it will assign itself as the first DNS server to anything that connects, with your actual DNS servers second and third."	0
1359	"Sometimes its DNS cache gets corrupted, which will start sending you to random websites."	0
1360	"IE, last night when I tried to go to Google, it was sending me to static"	0
1361	ak	0
1362	facebook	0
1363	com.	1
1364	"Resetting the router generally clears this up, but its pretty irritating when it happens"	0
1365	There is no way to configure the router not to set itself as the first DNS server when using DHCP.	0
1366	"What you can do on a PC is to set the DNS servers manually, which fixes the issue."	0
1367	"However, I have yet to find a way to do that on our phones, tablets, or other devices (like Tivos), so theyre basically stuck with this problem"	0
1368	"As I mentioned, it can be fixed by restarting the router, and it often fixes itself over time."	0
1369	Whats frustrating is that this has been a known issue for this router for many years and Linksys/Cisco do not appear to be willing to do anything about it	0
1370	"Its fine for what it is, and if you can find it cheap, itll do the job."	1
1371	"There are better routers out there for similar money that wont have these same issues, though."	0
1372	This product does exactly what it is supposed to do.	1
1373	I am not technologically savvy but I was able to set this up.	0
1374	There was a problem with the set up and I was able to call the 800 number and get free assistance.	0
1375	if my network had not outgrown this wonderful device i would till be using itthank you linkys for such wonderfull products	1
1376	Sometimes I look a bit to far for a good deal.	1
1377	This router is the same as the one I replaced due old age.	0
1378	"The old one works on occasion, its replacement not at all."	0
1379	This is one of the few refurbished products that I have had good success with.	1
1380	Linksys offers a 90 day warranty when others only offer a 30 day warranty and their quality control seems to be very good.	0
1381	"I have purchased at least a dozen of these in the past 6 months and every one has worked great so far with no drop-out, also, the range on this product has been excellent."	1
1382	"I highly recommend this router... and for the price, how can you go wrong!"	1
1383	I purchased this for someone else to use and I believe it to be just fine as I have heard no complaints.	1
1384	"Simple and easy to setup,required only one try."	0
1385	Continued using hard wire connection and wireless for remote solar monitoring equipment.	0
1386	"Very easy to install, the performance is excellent."	1
1387	No complaint with this router	0
1388	Cheap and reliable...	0
1389	This router is easy to set up--no problem.	1
1390	"Unfortunately it comes with an odd but very serious problem--ignored by Cisco--where it will randomly redirect your request to Facebook to MySpace, Google to Wikipedia, etc"	0
1391	Why?	0
1392	The router caches DNS routes--the paths that connect a domain ([...]) to an actual computer.	0
1393	This router messes those up with regularity.	0
1394	While its amusing at first--hey Facebook is now MySpace--this is a serious security issue.	0
1395	If the router chooses to redirect Google to a site that looks just like Google--but is controlled by a third-party--you could enter your username and password into that third partys system.	0
1396	The third party could then use those credentials to access your account.	0
1397	Imagine if that happened with your Amazon account?	0
1398	"Or your bank?Theres a two-year old thread on Ciscos site about this, with no solution (Google WRT160N dns).This is unacceptable in a product from a major vendor."	0
1399	"I made the mistake of buying this router, but you should not."	0
1400	Do not buy this router.	1
1401	"Well-priced, easy to set up and sleek."	1
1402	I am not sure if Ive noticed any speed difference from my previous Wireless-G modem but I think that has to do with my cable provider.	0
1403	I purchased the WRT160N v2 from DELL when I bought new laptops for my wife and I.	0
1404	"After using the router for eight months, we finally gave up and purchased a DIR-655 from D-Link"	0
1405	Installing the router was easy enough.	1
1406	We used the included installation CD.	0
1407	"We found out from experience that using the CD was not necessary, that Windows 7 and Vista would let us easily install the router"	0
1408	Our problems began almost immediately.	0
1409	"So long as we only connected one laptop to the router at a time, we would usually be OK for a while."	0
1410	"If we tried to connect a second laptop, the router would usually drop the the first connection."	0
1411	"Sometimes we could reconnect by using the diagnose and repair tool in the operating system or routers interface, and sometimes we couldnt."	0
1412	Sometimes we would have to resort rebooting one or both computers.	0
1413	"It made no difference how we attempted to configure the network, one or both computers connected wirelessly or through the wired ports, we could not count on having both machines connected to the internet through the router at the same time"	0
1414	We experienced the same problem whenever anyone in our neighborhood turned on their network.	0
1415	"Whenever a neighbor did that, our router immediately forgot who it was and what it was supposed to be doing, and required a power reset"	0
1416	Quite often the router would not let my wife connect to her Facebook account.	0
1417	"If we connected her machine to our cable modem directly, she would have no problems"	0
1418	Watching online videos was another hit or miss proposition.	0
1419	"Very often, we could watch 10 to 20 minutes of videos, before the router stopped functioning, and we would have to perform a power rest"	0
1420	"Thinking I might have installed the router incorrectly, I uninstalled and reinstalled the router multiple times."	0
1421	Nothing helped.	1
1422	Customer support was problematic.	0
1423	I have a hearing disability and understanding anyone with a heavy accent (read offshore) is very difficult	0
1424	This is a router that never should have come to market	0
1425	I finally gave up and replaced this router with a D-Link DIR-655.	1
1426	Since installing the new router we have had no problems	0
1427	I strongly suggest you do not purchase this router and I would have strong reservations about purchasing any home or small business router made by Cisco.	1
1428	"This router is great, if your machine is connected via ethernet"	1
1429	But wireless is not so good.	1
1430	"My main machine is wired, and connects just fine, but I have had nothing but trouble from this router when trying to connect laptops wirelessly -- three different laptops, three separate occasions -- even when using its installer via USB drive."	0
1431	I have no problem connecting and using those same laptops at other locations	0
1432	"Signal strength can be medium to poor, with the laptop only inches away from the router, and throughput is horrible."	0
1433	"I have tried several solutions, including changing the network mode, channel, frequency, and several of the advanced settings, to no avail"	1
1434	I think Ill switch to Netgear or Buffalo.	1
1435	"Before you purchase this item, please be aware that this router has been shown to redirect users to random websites (e"	0
1436	typing in [...] will send you to [...]).	1
1437	"There is a 24-page, one-year-old discussion thread on the Cisco website about this issue (google, WRT160N V3 has serious DNS issues), but the company doesnt appear to be responsive to customer complaints"	0
1438	I WOULD NOT buy this router unless you are prepared to invest time dealing with the inconvenience (and potential danger)arising from this redirection problem.	0
1439	Ive read a lot of reviews for this product and was wondering if I would have any problems at all.	0
1440	"So far, everything has worked fine."	1
1441	"The setup was easy and fast, way better than my previous Linksys G-router."	1
1442	Just follow the easy steps including installing the program.	1
1443	My computer sees the network and connects to it automatically as it would with any home network configured.	0
1444	I bought this router cause I wanted to stream movies to my Blu-ray player using a Netflix app (I dont mean to advertise but in case you want to do the same thing) and it does the job.	0
1445	I needed a high speed network since I wanted to stream hd movies so I upgraded to N. Ive watched several movies like this and Ive had a really good experience.	1
1446	The movie will take a couple of seconds to start the streaming and play but after that theres absolutely no interruption.	0
1447	I havent tried playing online games with a ps3 or Xbox but I assume it should work just fine since playing online games on my PC run the same as if I was connected via an ethernet cable.	1
1448	The specs should say the range of the router but this is where its not so good if you live in a two story house or a large single story one.	1
1449	"I live in an apartment that has two rooms, with the living room next to my room and the kitchen and a dining room on the other corner of my apartment."	0
1450	If I use my pc on the kitchen or further I notice my signal drops by half.	0
1451	I guess this is why it only costs around $50 vs $70 or more for other N-routers besides the network speed.	0
1452	"As you can read, the range is not so good."	1
1453	If you have an apartment like mine or probably a little larger you wont have any problems.	0
1454	"If you live in a larger house and you want to use your computer all around, get a higher range router."	1
1455	"Im a college undergrad, and considering all the stuff we use today in our apartments and the size of them Id say this router is perfect for us."	1
1456	I still have to wait and see what happens later in the year since I usually encounter problems with routers after a year or maybe a little less.	0
1457	There was a period of time when my previous router was having some issues and almost no computer could connect to it even though they saw it.	0
1458	I managed to fix that but it was a real pain and I had to access its default IP and a whole bunch of other procedures.	0
1459	I hope this doesnt happen this time	0
1460	I hope my review was helpful.	1
1461	"The way I see it, theres a chance you might be lucky like me or not."	1
1462	You could get a broken one that doesnt work well.	1
1463	The risk is up to you.	0
1464	I bought this product 1 week ago and I installed it without problems.	0
1465	"I put the router in a second floor, and it has some range signal in the first floor, therefore I am happy, because I can use my laptop with Internet anywhere in my house."	1
1466	I really recommend it.	1
1467	For the first 5 or 6 months I was having no problem with the connectivity to the internet with Linksys WRT160N router	0
1468	"And then, it began to have disconnection problem first once a day."	0
1469	And the disconnection problem frequency increased every week.	0
1470	Now it is more disconnected than it is connected to the web.	0
1471	Every time the diconnection happens I have to unplug the power adaptor from the power outlet and wait several minutes till its cool down	1
1472	I think it has a defect with the power adaptor that comes with the router	0
1473	"If you are looking for a reliable router, I would definitely not recommend this one."	1
1474	I bought the Linksys WRT160N router about two years ago.	0
1475	it worked well with my XP operating system.	1
1476	I purchased a new computer with Windows 7 operating system.	1
1477	This is where things started to go wrong.	0
1478	I receive 20 Mb/s connection speed from Comcast.	1
1479	"However, when I connect through the Linksys WRT160N router, the connection speed degrades throughout the day to 4 Mps."	0
1480	"When I called Linksys today (8/22/10), I was told that I needed to purchase a new router."	0
1481	That my two year old router was too old and needed to be replaced.	0
1482	Linksys offered me a $15 credit toward a new router.	0
1483	"Needless to say, this prompted me to go on every site that sells this router and let others know."	0
1484	They did not offer to help me upgrade the firmware.	0
1485	I am not sure I will stick with Linksys.	0
1486	Maybe it is time to try another brand.	0
1487	Ordered this router because my other router wrt54G stopped working after 4 years.	1
1488	This router was a suggestion by my tech who tried to revive the old router to no avail.	0
1489	He told me that the router was easy to set up and to buy a refurbished one because they were just as good.	1
1490	He told me that Amazon had the BEST price on this router from another store.	1
1491	Appears he was right on all counts.	1
1492	"Very, very easy to set up with my AT&T DSL modem and my wireless computers, printers and scanners in my office."	1
1493	I did it by myself!	0
1494	So far the router is working flawlessly so no worries about factory refurbished routers and who doesnt want to save money nowadays?	0
1495	After spending 3 days trying to get another brand to work (2 one-hour tech calls and 12 hours of frustration) we gave up and bought this router.	0
1496	Literally 10 minutes to wireless connectivity.	0
1497	I should have payed more attention to the reviews about this terrible product!	0
1498	I was hoping to replace my older Linksys WRT54G router laptop.	0
1499	"SO, I follow the router CD installation instructions, attempted a network repair using their crummy software utility, disabled the software firewall on my PC, performed a firmware upgrade, did the DD-WRT thing as well, you name it, I tried it!"	0
1500	"After about 3.5 hours, I was so put off, I took the router outside and put a hammer through it and proceeded to tossed it - in the garbage!"	0
1501	Please do not waste your time and $$$ on this piece of junk.	0
1502	Im very happy with my purchase.	1
1503	Im not one that knows a lot about electronics and I was able to easily get everything connected and running.	1
1504	"In addition to my desktop computer, I have connected my blu ray player (which streams Netflix and Pandora), a laptop and my wii console."	1
1505	Ive been using the router for a little over a month now and havent had any trouble since my initial connection.	0
1506	The Cisco-Linksys WRT160N wireless router was easy to set up and has worked  flawlessly so far.	1
1507	"In my opinion, it is an excellent value for the money."	1
1508	The optional Network Magic software for $40.	1
1509	is also worth purchasing.	0
1510	"It enables other devices, such as printers, to be connected wirelessly and to share files among computers on the network."	1
1511	This router is faster and has a much more consistent connection.	1
1512	Connect speed has consistently been over 110 mbps.	1
1513	Signal strength varies according to modem conditions and location of the router.	0
1514	Dont hide it in the furnace room behind the duct work).	1
1515	Compared to a G-version that I have used there is absolutely no comparison.	1
1516	The dual band allows for better connect speed as well and no little antennas to deal with.	1
1517	Be sure to use a compatible wireless-N adapter card in your PC too.	1
1518	"Fantastic easy to install, great coverage, if i could give more than 5 stars for range, I would."	1
1519	Everything i need and no complaints.	1
1520	"This router gets the job done, looks sleek, and has a nicer smaller wall plug, so it fits in better into my power strip with all the other big plugs."	1
1521	"The speed doesnt seem much faster than what the G router we had provided, but I realize other factors play into internet speed"	1
1522	My biggest complaint about the router is its advertised insistence that set-up was a piece of cake.	0
1523	Nope it wasnt.	0
1524	"It should have been, but wasnt."	1
1525	"We reached a point where we could successfully get internet when hard-wired in, but not wireless"	0
1526	Called Linksys/Cisco tech support -- the representative had no interest in really helping.	1
1527	"He went through 3 or 4 tests, and when he was still unsuccessful, his suggestion to us was that the router was defective, and we should get Amazon to give us our money back."	0
1528	"We laughed at that, cuz one of two things would have happened -- Amazon would have sent us another Linksys router, that may or may not be defective, or we just would have purchased a non-linksys brand, which Im sure that reps boss would have loved"	0
1529	"Anyway, a friend of ours is a network engineer."	1
1530	"He came to the house and worked his magic, configuring IP addresses on both our modem and our router for them to play nice together."	1
1531	"Without him, the Linksys router would have been returned for another brand."	0
1532	"The Linksys rep should have done what our network engineer friend did, but he either wasnt allowed to, didnt know how to, or didnt want to."	1
1533	And that to me is very disconcerting.	0
1534	Linksys support is nothing like it used to be.	0
1535	Have had no problems with it so far	0
1536	"Have never used a router beford, socant compare it to any other."	0
1537	I bought this router to use as an access point so my laptop computers could connect to my network and the internet either with an ethernet cable or wireless.	0
1538	I have 5 computers and a printer on my network and was wiring the router to a Linksys hub in my office that is about 75 from the cable router.	0
1539	"I managed to establish a wireless connection, but could not maintain it for any extended period of time."	0
1540	It would even drop connection in the next room after a few minutes.	0
1541	"I returned this router and bought an Apple Airport,at the suggestion of my son."	0
1542	"All my computers run Windows (XP and Windows 7) so I had not tried Apple products before, although I do have an Ipad ordered."	1
1543	"My sons network is also Windows based, so I took a chance on the Apple."	1
1544	The Apple Airport simply works!	1
1545	My house is around 3000 sq.	1
1546	ft. and I could maintain reception anywhere in it and even out on the deck.	1
1547	"The Linksys couldnt begin to match the reliability or throughput I got with the Apple and I would not recommend the Linksys, at least not for the type of application that I needed."	0
1548	The Apple was a breeze to install too.	1
1549	"If you look carefully at the reviews on this product, youll notice that most of the newer reviews for this product give it 1 star."	0
1550	"I suspect this is because the latest version of this product, the WRT-160Nv3, was released in mid/late 2009."	0
1551	I think its not a coincidence that this product has been getting consistently bad reviews.	0
1552	Hopefully my review (along with 200 others) can persuade you to save your time and money and look elsewhere for a wireless router	0
1553	I bought this to use in a small apartment.	1
1554	The wireless-N capability and decent price made it look like a good investment.	1
1555	Set-up with the provided install-disc took less than 10 minutes.	0
1556	"The bundled software did a decent job at monitoring network status and providing shortcuts for settings some parameters, but it was hardly necessary."	1
1557	"After installing the software, I connected my desktop via ethernet, and all was well."	1
1558	"Next, I configured the wireless settings from the built-in management page on the router (by default, this is 192.168.1.1)."	0
1559	"The management page was clean and easy to navigate, and I had a WPA2 wireless network set up in no time."	1
1560	"Logically, I tried to connect my laptop."	0
1561	"This is where the nightmare began..My laptop (a 15 Macbook Pro from 2008; Ive never had problems connecting to any other wireless networks before) detected the network at full strength but refused to connect, and consistently displayed connection failed or connection timeout errors."	0
1562	"I figured it might be a problem with WPA2, so I switched to WPA."	0
1563	Didnt help.	0
1564	"So I tried WEP, and even no security."	0
1565	Nothing worked.	1
1566	"Next, I played around with the advanced wireless settings."	1
1567	"After 2 hours of trying everything I know (4 years+ of working in the IT industry), and trying everything I could find online, I still couldnt get it to work."	1
1568	"I flashed DD-WRT onto the router, but that didnt help anything."	0
1569	Even boosting the radio Tx strength to 200 mW (almost 3 times the default strength of 71) didnt help.	0
1570	"For reference, my laptop was sitting RIGHT NEXT TO THE ROUTER on my desk"	1
1571	"At this point I was wondering if it was a problem with my laptop, so I borrowed a friends and tried connecting from there."	0
1572	"At first, his laptop wouldnt even detect the network from the next room."	0
1573	"After moving it closer, it just gave the same error messages I was receiving."	0
1574	"Just to be sure, I even brought out a third laptop, running a different OS, and tried it with that."	0
1575	"I also noticed that something funny was happening each time I attempted (and failed) to connect through the wireless; with each timeout, the router would reset itself, and my ethernet connection would disconnect for a few moments"	0
1576	"From my experience with the WRT-160Nv3, I conclude that it may make a decent network router if you plan on only using ethernet (for 50 bucks its hardly worth it), but it makes a downright terrible wireless router."	0
1577	Seriously.. the wireless part didnt even work.	1
1578	"This was a major disappointment, as Ive had great experiences with all the Cisco/Linksys products Ive used in the past."	0
1579	"Its possible that this particular router was a lemon, but 200 other reviewers also complained about similar problems, and Id prefer not to deal with another bad product again."	0
1580	Ill be trying a D-Link DIR-655 next ..	0
1581	"Pros -Sleek design; great finish and stylingEasy setup; plug and play; no compatibility issuesFamiliar web interface for configurationExpanded network rangeCons -Lasted 6 months; dropped DSL connections and self rebooted constantlyExtremely unreliable wireless; had to reboot router dailyVery long delay in establishing PPOE link to ISPSummary -Had a lot of confidence and hope given brand name but severely disappointedActually shocked that any item associated with Cisco could be such garbageCannot return to store now as past 1 month periodWill attempt compensation from Linksys but not hopeful - buyer beware, brand means nothing"	0
1582	"Please, do not even consider buying this product unless you are a glutton for punishment."	0
1583	"Linksys KNOWS the firmware inside is flawed, and they are not making any efforts to fix it."	0
1584	You will have multiple sites that occasionally will not load.	1
1585	You will have multiple sites that will be mysteriously re-directed to other pages.	0
1586	"And customer service, as nice as they may be, have no solutions."	1
1587	I have been told for MONTHS that the firmware problem is being addressed and that a new upgrade is coming that will fix these problems.	0
1588	"Its now late July, 2010."	0
1589	Ive heard that since January	0
1590	The easy solution to these problems is to not buy this router.	0
1591	"When I am able, I just bypass the router and let it sit unused."	0
1592	"Then, my internet experience is flawless."	1
1593	i have the router upstairs with my other computer but am using a netbook down stairs in my house (mainly got it so i could use the netbook down stairs)..the signal is low or very low but i can still get a connection..sometimes it doesnt connect or loses connection but i am able to get it back in a few mins.	0
1594	its a good product but i wish it had a stronger out put or signl my netbook could reach better.	1
1595	"Purchased to replace linksys G which worked really good,but wanted to upgrade to faster wireless."	1
1596	These units were installed in the exact location as the G units but could not get this N stuff to hardly work at all	1
1597	"Did all the instructions implied,but no success."	1
1598	"Overall this item works just fine and I have no complaints, I just gave it 4 stars because to say I love it seems a bit much...I upgraded from a D-link wireless-G router and have been very impressed with the increase in speed on my wireless network."	1
1599	"Every once in a while I do have to unplug it for a quick reset though, because my computers wont be able to connect for some unknown reason."	0
1600	"If you just surf the web, etc., this single band router is likely the way to go."	0
1601	"My regret comes in that I was hoping this would improve the speed of my network enough for streaming HD Netflix movies to my XBOX without interruption, which it alone does not."	0
1602	I would also have to spend another $100 to replace my G-adapter with an N-adapter for the XBOX.	0
1603	"The speed now is good enough to broadcast HD, but interference causes it to adjust down to lower resolution."	1
1604	Its a bit annoying	0
1605	"Also, I tried buying one of those USB wireless-N adapters (I tried a Belkin model) for my desktop, and it did not work well at all."	1
1606	"It just randomly dropped the connection, and I mean in intervals of minutes or hours, not days, so I returned it."	0
1607	"Be careful with N technology, it seems a bit buggy on the receiving end."	0
1608	"If you want to stream HD and/or have more than basic surfing needs, probably best to pay for the dual band N routers for dedicated channels instead of this basic version."	1
1609	This router has an issue where it doesnt resolve DNS correctly.	0
1610	"Many people have reported it to Linksys/Cisco via their support forum, but refuse to issue a fix"	0
1611	"I was a HUGE Linksys fan, but now I will avoiding them."	0
1612	Could not get it working at all even after several calls to support.	0
1613	It would never get an internet connection from my Comcast modem.	0
1614	Ended up returning it and getting a Belkin from Costco with similar specs and it worked without any hitches.	1
1615	"This router is fast, 100reliable and an amazing value for the money, especially for someone like me - I am not an IT person, all I want it to do is to connect a number of laptops to a printer and to the web."	1
1616	"I dont care about any extra features, but it must be totally reliable and easy to use because I am 100 222532972ependent on it as I work from home."	1
1617	After using this router for about 3 months on a very intense 24-7 basis I can say that it met all my expectations 100	0
1618	"I bought it to replace a crappy, unreliable and more expensive Netgear RangeMax Duo Wireless N router which constantly dropped connections and had to be rebooted 2-3 times a day, ugh..."	0
1619	The only (minor) criticism I have concerns the styling which means the router takes up more space than it should and cannot be stacked.	0
1620	I purchased a Lynksys wireless router that was impossible to install because the required login and password were not given to me in the package contents.	0
1621	"I called your technical support line and spoke to someone, which was nearly impossible to understand, for over an hour."	0
1622	He didnt know what he was doing and at one point wanted me to PAY him to remote access my computer to install the router.	0
1623	Obviously its not my fault that the required information needed to install the router was not included in the package so its not my responsibility to pay for services that would not have been required had the information been provided to me in the first place.	0
1624	Finally I was able to get him to understand that I would install the router all I needed from him was the information not provided in the packaging.	0
1625	Now 1 year later the router stops working.	1
1626	No rhyme or reason just stops!	1
1627	"Again I call customer support and now Im told that Im out of warranty so I will have to pay for technical support or go online, which is impossible due to the fact that the router is broken."	0
1628	The women I spoke to was absolutely rude and repeatedly tried to pass the blame onto me.	0
1629	Saying there must have been a power outage and if I would have used a surge protector...Which I do by the way and I havent had a power outage.	0
1630	And if I had youre telling me that your products fail when there is an outage and now its my responsibility to pay to fix your defective equipment?	0
1631	Another one was that my computer is dated or bogged down... Again its not but I appreciated the finger pointing anyway!	1
1632	So ultimately Im told by your staff that I will need to purchase a plan or go online.	0
1633	Thats it thats all she can do.	0
1634	I told her I wanted to speak to a supervisor and was told that wasnt going to happen.	0
1635	You need some changes to customer/technical support.	1
1636	They clearly are not helping you maintain customers.	0
1637	I am having trouble understanding how a router is working one day and just broken the next and clearly so does your staff as they repeatedly place blame on the consumer.	0
1638	I have never been more frustrated and disappointed with a company.	0
1639	You charge a lot for your products and then continue to charge your consumers so they are able to use them.	0
1640	How is that right?	1
1641	How do you choose to sell a product that you have no intention of backing or servicing?	0
1642	I would not recommend this product or any other from this manufacturer.	1
1643	Complete failure as far as your customer service and technical support are concerned.	0
1644	I purchased this particular router upon a recommendation from one of my colleagues.	1
1645	It was very easy to setup and took less than 5 minutes to install.	1
1646	I also found the 7 day trial of Cisco Magic Pro software very helpful and will probably purchase that as well.	1
1647	"I was concerned about coverage to the basement of the house, but had no issues."	0
1648	"I also wanted the router to be secure, but the setup wizard walked me through all that without dragging me into all the technical details."	0
1649	Id definitely recommend this router to anyone needing reliable and secure home wireless.	1
1650	This product was a snap to set up.	0
1651	Then I got nothing by intermitent Internet service and had to constantly reboot.	0
1652	"When I tried to upgrade to the latest firmware, it crashed in the middle of the process and was unable to be restored."	0
1653	I am now looking for a new router and will NEVER buy CISCO again.	0
1654	It was all I needed to get wireless and a second ethernet port working.	1
1655	Thanks	1
1656	I have always trusted Linksys (Cisco)... D-Link and Netgear make good wireless gateways too but Linksys has always caused me the fewest problems.	0
1657	One of Linksyss older models had issues where the router had to be restarted once in a while and firmware updates did not fix the issue but they seem to have worked these out.	0
1658	I have 2 of these routers and the first has been up and running without a forced restart (save power outages) for almost a year.	0
1659	"This is an excellent product, i do recommend to buy this router, is the best and amazon handle everything fast and serous..."	1
1660	"Bought this router about 8 months ago, worked fine until recently."	1
1661	I do a lot of VOIP calls and this router simply doesnt handle them anymore.	0
1662	I am seeing packet loss of up to 20-27284ch leads to intermittent pauses in audio.	0
1663	I also stream Netflix via the router and all of a sudden I cannot stream the films unless I do it via cable.	0
1664	"I called Linksys tech support and they said that this is normal!While this may work for those that are only browsing the web, this is far from being satisfactory for VOIP and streaming."	1
1665	I suggest that people avoid this product all together and put their money on other non-Linksys routers.	0
1666	This router is heading straight for the recycle bin and I am getting a D-Link router instead.	0
1667	The ease of this is great - when first bought.	1
1668	"Network Magic is given as a trial, and a disclaimer of once the trial runs out you wont need to buy it"	1
1669	Untrue.	0
1670	I could not get the connection without Network Magic.	1
1671	So I purchased a year of Network Magic.	1
1672	"after a few communications of no, its not my firewall, and yes I have reset my router, several times, and no, the ISP host name and domain name are still not populating, I have sent my last email to both CISCO and Network Magic."	1
1673	They will be getting this back if they do not give me a brilliant answer soon	0
1674	i was told valet is better....?	1
1675	"It works great, if you load the latest firmware."	1
1676	"I considered running opensource firmware, but the latest Linksys update worked fine."	1
1677	It has great range and hasnt gotten hung yet (in 6 months).	1
1678	I purchased a refurbished unit from back in the old days when these were terrible.	0
1679	It was a great buy for the money.	1
1680	I was heading to my parents home and they didnt have wireless.	0
1681	I wanted something easy and inexpensive that they will be able to allow their guests to hook up to.	1
1682	I ran the disk and it took care of the rest.	1
1683	Probably the easiest install I have ever done.	1
1684	Hooking up the second computer was so easy.	0
1685	find the network on the computer and push the button on the router.	0
1686	It was easier than I ever thought possible.	0
1687	Bought this as a replacement for a five year old linksys router.	0
1688	Set-up was a breeze on my laptop and once set up we moved it into the basement and it is working like a charm.	1
1689	My only complaint and I use the term loosely is that downloads Network Magic to home network.	0
1690	Completely unnecessary in Vista and not free	0
1691	Have the following devices working on it:Wireless:LaptopDesktopNetbook2 iTouchesNetwork Bridge for DVRHardwired:XboxHave it up and running for a week and am happy so far.	1
1692	Would recommend.	1
1693	"I bought 1 linksys router before, moving to new country, I have to buy a new one."	0
1694	"So, my choice was still Linksys which is a reliable decision :)"	1
1695	"Bought this because my old dlink g router wasnt cutting through very well to my upstairs studio, either to my new macbook or my xbox360."	1
1696	"Documentation in the packaging is useless, but its essentially a plug and play setup, automatically detecting the devices that are connecting to the network and customizing the signal."	0
1697	Setting a WPA2 secure network was even very straightforward with a little help from the internet.	1
1698	"The good thing about this router is that it is common, and you can find a lot of info online through forums and such."	0
1699	"Im still only getting a 3 bar connection on xbox live (though theres not as much lag as before), and my upload speeds havent improved from the g router; however, download speeds (regular web navigation, streaming video, etc) are much faster with this router"	1
1700	"One thing to note, which I overlooked, is that the wrt160n will detect all devices connecting to the network and then output according to the slowest device."	0
1701	"I have an older laptop, as well, and because it is only g-capable, the wrt160n was only outputting 802.11g...so it was effectively just a g router."	1
1702	"I hadnt realized that while this router is capable of doing all (a/b/g/n), it only outputs one at a time."	1
1703	"I solved the problem by setting it to output N only no matter the connecting device, then connected my old dlink router to one of the LAN ports on the wrt160n to create a second wireless network for my older laptop."	0
1704	The wrt160n handled that beautifully	1
1705	"Form factor is great, low profile with no antennae, looks good in any setting."	1
1706	Ive had it for about six weeks and so far no real issues with dropping signals suddenly.	0
1707	"Has happened once or twice, but not to the degree that some have described."	0
1708	"Overall, Im happy with the purchase."	1
1709	Wireless N for a very good price.	1
1710	I liked the router initially.	1
1711	Ease of set up and use was great.	1
1712	"Unfortunately, the router lasted 14 months before dying."	0
1713	"So, will look for another option."	1
1714	"The Cisco Linksys WRT160N router was a quick and easy setup, installed and running in less then a half hour."	0
1715	Works great.	1
1716	I purchased the Wireless-N Broadband specifically to improve the wireless connection to my Samsung Blue Ray which has a wireless connecter.	1
1717	I spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support just to get it set up on the computer and my netbook.	1
1718	I am worried about the netbook since the wireless setting is hard-coded to the Router).	0
1719	I am unable to get a connection with the router from the Blue Ray either wireless or manually input.	0
1720	I tried tech support again - was put on hold for 15 minutes - I hung up	0
1721	How does Cisco make a profit with the need for tech support.	1
1722	The instruction booklet is on the CD and I could not find support at the website; the CD stopped at an error code which I could not get past without tech support	0
1723	I am taking this unit back.	0
1724	Will try another with simple installation.	0
1725	It took me about 5 min to set it up without any problem.	0
1726	It works very well.	1
1727	I got this router a few months ago (WRT160N V3) and its been nothing but trouble.	0
1728	It works...if youre in the same room....	1
1729	It requires frequent resets.	0
1730	My free wireless modem from ATT has better range in my home.	1
1731	Im moving on to something better.	1
1732	"After 1 year and 5 months, the ethernet wired connection to the router to my desktop, failed."	0
1733	The tech support line gave me all the wrong solutions and made the problem worse by not diagnosing the fact that the ports were not working properly.	0
1734	"When they discovered that, they determined that my warranty period was expired and then they wanted to sell me an extended warranty."	0
1735	"Im a very tolerant guy but the people doing their tech support speak unintelligible English, complicating matters a great deal."	1
1736	"Also, they sold me an adapter for my desktop that I didnt need."	0
1737	I went out today and bought another router and hope that my charge card company will honor its extended warranty and refund my purchase price.	1
1738	I would never buy a Linksys again.	0
1739	I have used the WRT160N for 2 weeks now.	0
1740	It works great & with multiple laptops & streaming video (international TV channels).	1
1741	WRT160N is much superior to Linksys Wireless B which worked fine for 7 years but seems to have a problem with Vista 64bit machines.	1
1742	I am getting up to 24 mbs without dropping connection with the WRT160N.	0
1743	"During setup the router software did not find the internet connection (through cable), but seems to work fine if I ignore that error-I did not expect to connect to internet given the error, but I could connect to the internet."	0
1744	"The reasons I did not give it a 5 star are: (1) I have used it for only 2 weeks, (2) I havent yet setup the security as I wanted to see what speeds I get before the security setup."	0
1745	I dont know if once I setup the security whether there will be any speed loss or if the security will be difficult to setup.	0
1746	3) I wish it had a port for a USB printer.	1
1747	I purchased this unit assuming I could expect liking it based on past experience with Linksys/Cisco products.	1
1748	Over time though Ive grown to hate it.	0
1749	"Not so much from a performance standpoint, (overall it seems reliable, particularly if hardwired to it), but more from a setup/quality of use standpoint."	0
1750	Ive found the setup can be pretty frustrating particularly for additional wireless devices.	0
1751	"When things work, fine, when they dont... good luck and youre going to need it"	1
1752	"Documentation sucks, consisting primarily of a step 1, step 2, quickie set-up which unfortunately is inaccurate, thereby going wrong right from the start."	0
1753	"Worse, some of the touted features might work IF, you buy a subscription to their Network Magic support software."	1
1754	"If you dont, too bad, youre then pretty much on your own from that point forward."	1
1755	"Neither the box, nor their ads, bother to point out that a subscription is required for those features"	0
1756	"And worse still, if you dont subscribe, you may expect to be badgered on a regular basis by an extremely annoying hype screen which pops up every third or so many times you log on.... forever, as there is no way to opt out and tell it dont bother me again."	0
1757	Pretty disgusting when a company like Cisco has to stoop to the sales methods of viral trojans and rogue software	0
1758	"I own it, I use it, but I hate and wish I never bought it, nor would I recommend it."	1
1759	"And I find I grow to loathe it even more every time the Network Magic hype screen interrupts my startup forcing me to actively click out, to opt out."	0
1760	Sleazy and annoying.	0
1761	Hardly the approach to encourage me to invest more money with them.	1
1762	"Very simply, trying to change any settings in the router will FAIL if you use Safari."	0
1763	"I cant speak for other browsers, but I know that Firefox works for sure!"	0
1764	Router was excellent for 18 months.	1
1765	Just quit working.	0
1766	Computers and Xbox on the network no longer connect.	0
1767	Main computer wont connect to the internet unless I remove the router and connect it directly.	0
1768	The firmware will not update on it.	0
1769	For 80 dollars the router should have lasted longer.	0
1770	Last Linksys Ill buy.	0
1771	"Every time I try out another linksys product, I swear it will be the last one."	0
1772	"Then every few years, I decide to give them another chance and regret it."	0
1773	So here we go again...The good:  It looks pretty nice	1
1774	The bad:  30 minutes of use and Im about to throw the thing in the garbage.	0
1775	There is something wrong with the DNS server on the most recent version of this router (hardware v3).	0
1776	It manifests itself by sending you to the wrong website.	0
1777	"The most common one, and the one I experienced almost instantly, is trying to go to facebook, and being sent to myspace."	0
1778	"The issue is pretty well discussed on ciscos website - it is definitely a _router_ issue, not a software or OS issue - but they havent bothered fixing it."	0
1779	"I know people dont like to believe bad reviews - but Im just trying to help - so before you buy this, just go to Ciscos website, go to the support forums, and search for WRT160N DNS, and sort by replies."	0
1780	"The top two topics are person after person, unable to -browse the internet- with this router"	0
1781	"Conclusion:  Cant really comment much about the routers ability to handle lots of connections, its range, or anything else."	0
1782	But do you really need to know more?	1
1783	"If a router sends you to the wrong website, its not worth, well, anything."	0
1784	They couldnt even get the most basic functionality right.	1
1785	There is something wrong with this company.	0
1786	"Insert the supplied CD, and follow the instructions."	0
1787	One simply cannot go wrong.	0
1788	"In 15 minutes I had my 5 computers, a sling box, media player and 2 blu ray DVDs up and running."	1
1789	"No need for technical knowledge, just do as the instructions tell you."	1
1790	I could not be happier.	1
1791	"I replaced a Chinese no name (PCI) that is also an N protocol, but my network constantly had problems communicating."	0
1792	We upgraded to this router after our old router was not compatible with our Direct TV on-demand function.	1
1793	It was not a smooth installation as we had hoped (where our old router had been very easy).	1
1794	"When we finally had it up and running, we found that range had actually gone down."	0
1795	Our old G router had far more power in the rooms furthest from the router.	1
1796	What a disappointment.	0
1797	"Now, after only one year, the router is going bad."	0
1798	"We have tried firmware updates, and even replaced our modem, but it turned out it was the router to begin with."	0
1799	I am now going to research a better rated router.	1
1800	Dont waste your money on this lousy router.	0
1801	This unit was very easy to set up and use.	1
1802	Ive had no problems with it.	0
1803	highly recommend	1
1804	"I dont actually own this router, but my boyfriends mom bought one when she got a new ASUS Windows 7 laptop."	0
1805	And I was the one who suffered when she had problems with it.	0
1806	"This is a bit long for a review, but I wanted to get everything out"	1
1807	"I walked her through the setup over the phone, which was VERY well done."	1
1808	Shes not very computer savvy whatsoever and she had no problem getting it setup	0
1809	"However, the problem is WPA2 encryption; this router cannot seem to handle it."	0
1810	"With WEP or no encryption, it connected instantly and stayed connected about 751520712554f the time"	1
1811	"I am not entirely sure the laptops wireless NIC isnt too blame, but I tried everything."	0
1812	"I reinstalled it, I disabled it."	0
1813	I renamed the SSID numerous times.	0
1814	I tried every wireless channel and any other options available to the the router and the laptop.	1
1815	"It would connect about half of the time, but would disconnect itself and not reconnect."	0
1816	"Sometimes rebooting would fix it, sometimes not"	0
1817	"I did attempt to upgrade the firmware, but it came with the newest already installed, and it wont let you reinstall the same version"	1
1818	WPA didnt work at all.	1
1819	The laptop refused to connect	0
1820	She returned the router after I bought her a D-Link Extreme (DIR-655).	1
1821	"So far, (its been about a week), and the D-Link hasnt had any issues"	0
1822	"I chose the D-Link because I am currently using it, and my roommates new HP laptop (Windows 7) had no issues."	0
1823	"The HP did have a similar WPA2 problem with a Belkin I had bought, but the D-Link fixed those issues also"	0
1824	"The D-Link also has considerably better range, but the Linksys is using an internal antenna instead of three external"	1
1825	"If you are using Windows 7 with wireless, I would suggest NOT getting this router."	0
1826	I try to install this on my computer.	1
1827	It took a long time to download.	0
1828	My computer froze because of that.	0
1829	I tried it again and it dont work anymore.	0
1830	I cant set up the wi-fi.	1
1831	"My computer genius out-of-town brother told me, it download half the info and I cant start over again and I cant complete it."	1
1832	I have to use this on a new computer and not the existing computer.	0
1833	This piece of equipment is riddled with problems.	0
1834	"To start, the installation disk would not load correctly no matter how much security I cut off."	1
1835	"After a bit of luck and 4 hours of attempts, I finally got it running."	0
1836	"It seemed fine for the first few days, then the internet just started dropping every few minutes."	0
1837	The problem got bad enough that I had a downtime of 40 minutes every hour.	0
1838	I thought it was the provider and had 3 service calls.	0
1839	"After alot of irritation, they finally asked me to run the internet on one computer with just the modem."	0
1840	Amazing!	1
1841	It worked!	1
1842	"So I got on the Linksys website and do a bit of forum searching, since calls to the company and a search of their site didnt help."	0
1843	I discovered that all the updated firmware versions have a small bug that disables the DNS server...	0
1844	Uh huh...	0
1845	"Furthermore, I see an employee say that there is no intent to fix the problem in later updates for the firmware..."	0
1846	The only choice is to downgrade to the original firmware that was abadoned for a serious security risk.	0
1847	I did that anyway and had a good WORKING router for almost 6 months.	1
1848	Now the router is starting to fail in the exact same way as before.	0
1849	"I was a serious fan of Linksys before this, but now I am reconsidering ever buying their products again."	0
1850	Espescially since the calls I made all blamed my service provider instead of the faulty firmware.	0
1851	Do NOT buy this paperweight/doorstop unless you need to get an enemy a birthday present...	0
1852	I have purchased two of these routers.	1
1853	"The first one failed after about a year, and the second one failed after only seven months."	0
1854	What a waste of my time and money!	0
1855	Ill would not recomend this product to anyone and Ill never buy another Cisco product again.	0
1856	Terrific prouduct.	1
1857	Shipping via UPS ground arrived in 2 days.	1
1858	Easy to set up and works great.	1
1859	I have two Linksys gaming adapters which were being used on my old wireless G router and they were easy to reconfigure to the new 5.8mhz frequency that was offered on this router.	1
1860	I now can use to watch Directv using their multiple room settings (currently on beta testing) wirelessly	1
1861	The router essentially creates two networks--one on the old frequency and a new one with the name media in the default name that is on the higher frequency whic I use for just that purpose	0
1862	"Lastly, you even have the option of using different security settings on each frequency so you can use the older WEP security on one network and the newer, faster, more secure WPA method on the other"	1
1863	I highly recommend the refurb as intial support is identical to the factory new version and it was about half the price.	1
1864	"This thing is spotty, undependable, and slow as hell."	0
1865	"It doesnt even give a signal to my wireless devices half the time, and if I can actually get them to connect, its just the luck of the draw."	0
1866	What a piece of crap.	0
1867	I had this router for 2 months and it died on me.	0
1868	I plugged in the power and no lights or response.	0
1869	I contaced Linksys directly and they had the worst customer service  ever..	0
1870	They do not help and kept telling me that my warranty was up.	0
1871	This product is supposed to come with a 90 day manufacturer warranty.	1
1872	It has only been 2 months since i bought this.	0
1873	I know I was speaking to someone in a diffrent country and they kept going in circles with their answers.	0
1874	"To make a long story short, Please do not by Linksys , especialy a refurb."	0
1875	Spend the extra few bucks and get a new one.	1
1876	Luckily amazon took care of me.	0
1877	"After having read mixed reviews, i went ahead and orderd the product for basic needs of routing without dual-band capability."	1
1878	"Setup was quick but had initial hiccups with bandwidith; so downloaded and installed the latest firmware, and it then worked fine since then."	0
1879	"Depending upon wireless adpater, one of my laptop gets fixed 54Mbps signal whereas the other one signal reading fluctuates from 1M to 130Mbps depending on the data traffic flowing thru."	1
1880	all in all it is working ok within routers functions.	0
1881	"Honestly, I wouldnt buy or recommend this particular model to any one."	1
1882	I Had to return two of this router after ordering the routers from two different vendors.	0
1883	Return was done flawless.	1
1884	I had to contact linksys support and even paid them $10.00 so they could get full control of my computer for them to be able to install the router.	0
1885	Still after paying them and the person try for about an hour and half I was told that the router was diffective.	0
1886	I forget to mentioned that before I was told that the router was deffective I had spend within two days 8 hours of my time trying to get this router to work	0
1887	"Not a happy customer,but I am very happy that I did purchased these two routers with amazon, because the returns as I said before was not a problem."	1
1888	My Verizon wireless worked just fine.	1
1889	This unit does not.	1
1890	I spent a whole day trying to set up this router for wireless to no avail.	1
1891	Nowhere did it say the setup disk worked only for windows systems.	1
1892	"In fact, the program indicated that the setup had been completed and the unit was operational."	0
1893	The box lists my operating system.	1
1894	It worked fine with an ethernet cable directly plugged into the computer.	1
1895	but none of the wireless devices were able to log on because of a wrong password message.	0
1896	I re-setup the system at least 7 times to no avail even re-setting the factory settings.	0
1897	The Cisco web page was of little help.	0
1898	"The help section on the web site branches repeatedly in telling you how to manually set up this router(if this then go here, etc."	0
1899	The manual is too involved and technical for the average user.	0
1900	I havent been this unhappy with an electronic device in a long time.	1
1901	Im returning it in the morning.	0
1902	"Thats a user experience....(after fighting for hours against a different product from a different manufacturer, which I had eventually returned....)From start to end 13 minutes installation, set-up, etc...Very friendly."	1
1903	Very fast and no hussle	1
1904	And since then it works...	1
1905	"Honestly, this router is a joke."	0
1906	I tried so hard with this thing.	0
1907	"I got it for cheap, and should have known better."	0
1908	I did everything needed to get this thing running.	1
1909	"I honestly expected to have to do tons of port forwarding and buying additional things, as well as spending time on customer support for hours troubleshooting."	1
1910	I gave it my all	0
1911	"When finally it seemed I had everything working, I didnt"	1
1912	"I use it primarily for my computer in my room, one floor above the router and almost parallel to it, and for my Xbox and PS3."	0
1913	I did SO much.	1
1914	Went as far as to buy a wireless N adapter for it that cost 100 dollars.	0
1915	I moved the router in different areas and STILL.	1
1916	"I had a WRT54G which was supposedly a horrible router, yet it worked 50 times better than this thing could ever seem to"	0
1917	The problems?	0
1918	"Well, now I have dead zones in my house."	1
1919	My laptop barely ever picks up a signal of which was formerly a full five bars.	1
1920	I constantly drop in and out.	0
1921	"My video game systems are giving me a different error each time that I turn them on, to which has only been addressed as an unknown and unfix able issue by Sony or Microsoft"	0
1922	"All in all, I believe this router would be ideal for sitting 5 feet away from it with a small laptop, searching through amazon for a new router, but no more than that."	1
1923	It is not stable enough to support a home network and nowhere near stable enough to try and support a decent work network	1
1924	"Sure, its got all the bells and whistles that a linksys should have, but if the router can fail to deliver a signal to a room directly above where its set up, how can one utilize such features?A big waste of money and time."	0
1925	Just get something else.	1
1926	This product is actually OK.	0
1927	"But, the first time something glitchy happened, I called the support number for help."	0
1928	I was told that they would charge me $30 to help me solve my problem.	0
1929	The solution actually only took 5 minutes (but it took me 2 hours to find it online).	0
1930	It would have been faster for the tech to help me than to explain all my purchasing options.	1
1931	Doesnt this company take ANY pride in their product?	1
1932	Id have been a loyal customer if they took 5 minutes to help me on the phone.	1
1933	Now I will never buy any of their products.	0
1934	"It seems this router needs roughly a weekly restart to remain 100 0.000000unctional, especially when using bittorrenting or FTP/Rsync backups."	0
1935	"Also, at times, it is not able to detect whether or not a computer/device is connected to the network(the IP and mac addresses are not shown in the DHCP status page) although the computer clearly is connected to the network and functional."	0
1936	"Setup is easy when going through the HTML config page, although I havent used the included software."	0
1937	"Overall, this is not a reliable router by any means."	1
1938	"Another downside is that the switch is only 10/100, although its not advertised as a gigabit router, its just another downside that turned me off to this router."	0
1939	I switched to a dual band N Netgear router and have been satisfied ever since.	1
1940	update...I think this product is crapping out on me.	0
1941	"It was good while it lasted, but it really didnt last more than a few years."	1
1942	Not sure if it was worth the money.	0
1943	I always found myself resetting the router.	0
1944	"I wouldnt buy it again, and wouldnt recommend it to others"	1
1945	"old review...I read most of the reviews and although some scared me, I would 100recommend this router."	0
1946	"I didnt play the CD before trying to hook up the linksys router and modem, but that didnt keep them from working perfectly together with my Comcast high-speed internet."	1
1947	Bottom line: dont let the bad reviews scare you away.	0
1948	For the price I paid I cant complain too much.	1
1949	I went with Linksys because i knew they were part of Cisco and are known to have respectable customer service.	0
1950	I ordered this product because of the supposed extended range however once installed it was hardly that.	1
1951	I couldnt get a wireless signal outside of the office.	1
1952	"After 2 hrs on the phone with their customer service, we finally got the router to work like it was supposed."	1
1953	"Since this was a factory refurb it needed to be updated, however it came with a 30 day money back guarantee (with customer service included - normally they would have told me to get lost)."	0
1954	Overall this router follows previous Linksys conventions.	0
1955	The show stopper is the power supply.	0
1956	"Per linksys web site, The new WRT160N V3 is delivered with a new type of power adapter (model number MU06-6120050-C5) which doesnt power up according to the steps described in the installation wizard..The net net of this restriction is that the unit wont reboot after a power outage without intervention."	0
1957	"You have to, per Linksys:Power up this unit, you need to do the following steps:Step 1:Plug the power adapter to the power source"	0
1958	"Step 2:Plug  the power adapter jack to the WRT160N v3.This is totally unacceptable, see:[...]"	0
1959	2+ hours on my own trying to install this for a couple of computers and a home theater system - with no success.	1
1960	Another 5.5 hours with Cisco tech support (1st and 2nd level).	1
1961	Still not working.	1
1962	"Ive become used to challenging Linksys setups, but have continued to purchase because once theyre installed, they tend to be bulletproof."	0
1963	"However, this product, and the associated WAP610Ns, have hit new benchmarks for setup difficulty and tech support."	0
1964	"Theyre going back in the box , and are being returned."	0
1965	Just unbelievably bad.	0
1966	Amazing.	1
1967	Ill never buy another Cisco/Linksys product.	0
1968	The installation pain threshold is just too high.	0
1969	Router works great after upgrading the firmware...before upgrade it only worked on the computer it was wired to (defeats the purpose)... after the upgrade I havent had any issues.	1
1970	Instructions for upgrading firmware can be found on linksys knowledge base.	0
1971	Upgraded from older wired linksys to wrt160n.	1
1972	Only thing I didnt like about the purchase was that it didnt tell you version number (apparently need to avoid v1 and v2).	0
1973	"Luckily, looks like they fixed it and I received v3.Setup took ridiculously short time (took hours on the wired one, especially since I needed to clone IP/open ports) - transferred all of my settings to new router"	0
1974	Only thing I had to do was go in and edit wireless settings on laptop to allow for file/print sharing	1
1975	Very good range and signal quality	1
1976	Design looks much better than most (if not all) similarly priced wired/wireless routers	1
1977	would recommend it	1
1978	i BOUGHT THIS ROUTER TO REPLACE MY NETGEAR WHICH WAS MANY YEARS OLD.	0
1979	"wHEN linksys DID NOT WORK, i HAD TO CALL TECHNICAL SERVICE 7 TIMES BEFORE FINALLY GETTING SOMEONE TO WORK ON MY ISSUE."	0
1980	THE DECIDED IT WAS DEFECTIVE AND i WOULD HAVE TO MAKE even more CALLS TO GET A REPLACEMent.	0
1981	"My calls to service were either with tech service agents who know nothing, were lazy and incoherent, disconnected me or were rude and insulting."	0
1982	Finally ended with someone who helped but after 4 hours could do nothing.	0
1983	I returned it (I dont know why that took me so long!	0
1984	and bought another netgear router-it works thank goodness!They also try to charge you 10 dollars to help you get the NEW router set up faster..unbelievable!	1
1985	worst linksys router ive owned yet...rivals my opinion of D-Link routers.	0
1986	"stay away, go find something else."	0
1987	"the problems I have encountered...drops wireless connection intermittantly (have checked, is not my laptop), gets confused when I connect a switch to the router, denies switch access to the internet and does not allow DHCP to establish ip addresses for devices on the switch (not the switch, works great with other routers)."	0
1988	"again, stay away, has to be an embarassment for linksys to even conceive such a device."	0
1989	This model has been very stable and reliable.	1
1990	"There is no antenna options, but the wireless range is very good."	1
1991	Update the firmware to get a speed boost because the stock firmware is flakey.	0
1992	"If you are using 802.11b - g, you will pleased with the increased speed."	1
1993	You may have to change 802.11n channel width to auto on the router and the adapter to obtain N speed.	1
1994	Use Auto settings to get the best speed.	1
1995	"If you use DHCP, then just plug it in and forget the Linksys setup."	0
1996	I was pretty skeptical about spending the money to upgrade from a wireless G router to a wireless N router.	0
1997	I figured it wouldnt make a noticeable difference...	1
1998	Boy was I wrong!	0
1999	"Previously, pages would take a good 10 to 30 seconds to load, depending on the site - even though I have an upgraded cable connection."	1
2000	With this router - the full potential truly comes out!	0
2001	"Pages load in under 3 seconds, nearly instantly!This is definitely one of the best purchases I have made in the past year when it comes to technology."	1
2002	I do a lot of work from home and this has definitely increased my productivity!	1
2003	I have this Linksys router WRT160N (Version3) and let me start by saying this - THIS IS THE WORST AND THE CRAPPIEST ROUTER I HAVE EVER SEEN AND PERSONALLY USED	0
2004	"I have been using all brands of routers for many years and even though they dont have any moving parts, somehow almost all routers die after 2-3 years (or at least I have noticed significant performance drop)."	0
2005	"I bought this router last Aug09 and initially, it was amazingly easy to setup, very snappy, and would constantly show me download/upload speeds of 20Mbps/5Mbps (Cablevision Boost subscription) on all machines in my 2-bedroom 1100sq"	1
2006	ft condo.	0
2007	I have 1 desktop/2 laptops/2 iPhones/1 PS3 connecting wirelessly to this router and 1 Xbox 360 hard-wired.	0
2008	"At any time, no more than 2-3 devices are online simultaneously"	0
2009	Like I said things were great initially - all devices had great connection speeds even if connected simultaneously.	1
2010	"However after 3 months or so of use, all of a sudden I started noticing deterioration in connection speeds."	0
2011	Even using 1 PC at a time would load webpages slower than usual.	0
2012	"On Speakeasys connection speed test ([...]), it was showing downspeeds of less than 10Mbps, which is still relatively fast but if my ISP is sending 20Mbps to my home, why should I settle for anything less than that (and I am paying extra for faster connection too)."	1
2013	"To make sure it wasnt Cablevision, I hard-wired one laptop to the broadband modem and I was back at 20+Mbps speeds."	0
2014	Restarting the router fixed speed problems immediately but it soon became a monthly ritual	0
2015	"Fast forward to February 27 10... this month alone, I remember restarting the router at least 4-5 times because the connection speeds would come to a crawl."	1
2016	Crawl = less than 1Mbps(down)/500kbps(up).	1
2017	"Before today, last time I had rebooted the router was last Sunday."	1
2018	Today I was using just my desktop and I couldnt believe when it took almost 30 secs to load google homepage....	1
2019	GOOGLEs!!!!!	0
2020	30 seconds to load 1 logo image and close to about 40 words!!!	1
2021	"On Speakeasy speedtest, not shockingly my down speed was 62kpbs and upspeed was 400kpbs."	1
2022	This is beyond ridiculous!!	0
2023	Rebooting the router brought the speeds back up to 22Mpbs/5Mbps but this is within a week of last reboot!Needless to say I called Linksys customer support in Jan10 to log in my complaints.	0
2024	The technician was nice/helpful and ran several remote tests on the router although nothing yielded any significant results.	1
2025	"Somewhere during the course of the support call, I ended up mentioning that I have 7 or so machines connecting to the router but never more than 2-3 connecting simultaneously."	0
2026	"From that point on, the tech kept pushing the theory that I have too many machines and that the router is not designed to handle that many simultaneous connections."	0
2027	Seriously???	1
2028	3 simultaneous connections and this router chokes???	1
2029	The friendly company man even made a recommendation that perhaps I should sell this router off and invest in another Linksys dual-band router.	1
2030	He even gave me the model#.	0
2031	Think I am going to heed his advice but take it a step further.	0
2032	SELL OFF THIS ROUTER AND NEVER EVER BUY A LINKSYS ROUTER AGAIN!!	0
2033	I consider myself a bit of a geek and all my friends come to me for advice when it comes to technology/gadgets.	1
2034	I will never ever recommend another linksys product again either.	1
2035	"If there were any way to rate this router lower than 1 star, I probably would have gone for that"	0
2036	OVERALL EXTREMELY BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PRODUCT!	0
2037	Well had this router since last Oct.	1
2038	"The first time the wireless dropped was when I first got it, a firmware upgrade fixed it for about 2 months."	0
2039	"Then the dropping started with no long term fix, had to start resetting/rebooting or unplugging, read somewhere that it maybe a firmware issue, ok got DD-WRT the longest the wireless stayed up with that is 8 days 20 hours 30 mins."	0
2040	"DD-WRT has a uptime clock, anyway I have a new none Linksys router coming."	0
2041	"The Linksys WRT160Nv3 looks nice, but I got a Wireless router, for the wireless."	1
2042	This unit is easy to setup.	1
2043	Beware the more you use it the more intermittent your internet connection can be.	0
2044	I returned the 1st unit because of the intemittent internet connectivity.	0
2045	I also calked limksys customer support and they are aware of the issue.	0
2046	For a fee they will remote in and change setting to fix the issue.	0
2047	There website does not have a fix that I can see.	0
2048	Pay the fee and who knows how much more money they will want	0
2049	STAY  AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
2050	Purchase some other wireless product that will be stable and keep working.	1
2051	"To set expectations, I just wanted to get a new router, with Draft N support, to replace my old Linksys router from 2000/2001."	0
2052	I had no intentions of flashing dd-wrt on it.	0
2053	"Essentially I wanted to allow occasional wireless internet access to my PS3, iTouch, Canon mp 560 printer, and my work computer as well as stable wired connectivity to my office computer."	1
2054	Also most of my devices are in the same room or nearby	0
2055	For all intents and purpose it works fine and I cant say that Im dissatisfied.	1
2056	"With Time Warner Road Runner Standard, I was able to measure speeds of 8Mb down on my PS3 and pretty reliable connectivity on the iTouch"	1
2057	I keep my office computer wired and can get up to 23Mb down	1
2058	I did not mess with the software that came bundled with the router.	0
2059	"Instead, I just powered it up, and went to the admin console via browser to set up all the security features."	1
2060	"I would recommend changing all default passwords, implementing WPA2 AES, and using the max number of characters for the WPA2 key (63 characters)."	1
2061	"Some people recommend disabling SSID broadcasting and MAC address filtering, while others think they are a waste of time."	0
2062	I personally disabled my SSID broadcasting and skipped the MAC address filtering	0
2063	"I have version 3, found that connectivity has been pretty reliable, and have yet a need to bounce the router"	1
2064	"As a caveat for wireless access, the WRT160N supports frequency of 2.4 GHz."	1
2065	"You might encounter some interference with wireless phones, or other nearby networks."	0
2066	I would also suggest experimenting with the channel if need be.	0
2067	"I believe the default for most routers is channel 6, so you might want to try the other non-overlapping channels, 1 or 11."	0
2068	This router was shipped with the wromg software.	0
2069	After working with tech support for more than an hour we could not make it work.	1
2070	"Returned the item defective,Have not recieved credit as of Feb 21."	0
2071	I am using this router with Comcast cable internet service and it works great.	1
2072	It took some time to get it setup correctly.	0
2073	After several calls to Comcast I learned that you have to let the cable modem boot up completely before you try and power on the router.	0
2074	"Once I did that, everything else went great."	1
2075	Ive now had it for a couple of months and it works great.	1
2076	Connection is strong and speeds are good.	1
2077	"I checked to ensure this was a V1 router, because of all the V2 issues."	0
2078	I was told via email I would receive V1.	1
2079	"Of course, it arrived and was a V2 router."	0
2080	Did I expect what I was told?	0
2081	"Honestly, not really."	1
2082	Lack of accountability in the good ole USA is at an all time high.	0
2083	It is accepted by most and appears to be the American way.	1
2084	"Government, police."	0
2085	"and biz execs do this on a much higher scale, obviously."	0
2086	Nobody seems accountable for anything.	0
2087	It is truly the downfall of this nation.	0
2088	And seems to be acceptable now.	0
2089	"When confronted with the issue, PlusDigUSA told me they dont ship the routers... so, why even bother ensuring me Ill get what I ordered?"	0
2090	Pass the buck.	0
2091	Nobody would be surprised really.	1
2092	This has become so common place.	0
2093	"This, in a nutshell, is why this country is in the state it is."	0
2094	Nobody is accountable.	0
2095	And nobody cares.	1
2096	Sorry to ramble... but had to be said.	0
2097	After 2 months use signal drops every 5 seconds.	0
2098	"Linksys tech support worse than useless, reading from script, not helpful."	0
2099	"The pain of trying to get a refubed unit to replace this with and have it do the same thing was too much to bear, bought a DLink and mailed this to Linksys customer relations."	0
2100	Ive had a WRT54G for many years and decided to get the WRT160N (Jan 2010).Works great.1.	1
2101	"I did not use the CD to set it up (all that Network Magic stuff is to sell more s/w, Ive used it and uninstalled it, didnt do much for me)2."	1
2102	Set it up using your browser and default URL: 192.168.1.13.	0
2103	Firmware version: 3.00.02 (out of the box)It is faster than the WRT54G.	1
2104	The signal strength is great (2-story house with intermediate walls).	1
2105	And it looks low/sleek and cool (especially in the dark)...Not sure why do many have had problems (earlier versions?	1
2106	"Unfortunately, I was never able to get this router to work properly."	0
2107	I spent an entire day following the directions (which were quite simple) only to find when I got to the final step it told me that I had no Internet connection and I should contact my cable provider.	0
2108	Then I would start from scratch and go through the process only to get the same result	0
2109	"I have been using an 802.11b,g router from Cisco/Netgear for many years with no problem so this was very discouraging."	0
2110	I am the head of IT at a 4-year college and was really disappointed with the product and ultimately returned it to Amazon.	0
2111	Amazon was very nice about the return but Im really discouraged that ordering this on-line and having to return it took over 2 weeks (I didnt pay for one-day shipping since I didnt need it urgently).Now I am looking for another vendor for an 802.11N router.	1
2112	Note: I searched on Internet forums and found a variety of opinions including some people who had the same problem but no clear solutions.	0
2113	We ended up purchasing this router to replace another Linksys that failed after 3 years of use.	0
2114	It configured easy enough.	1
2115	But I have discovered that the throughput on the 10MB cable connection degrades to about .3mb after several days of use.	0
2116	"Resetting the router fixes the problem for a few days, but who wants to deal with that annoyance."	0
2117	This is a V3 of the router and its not worth my time to spend working with customer support or searching the internet any longer for solutions.	0
2118	So Ill be shopping for something else to replace it.	0
2119	This is a terrible router.	0
2120	"Im not sure if its because of no antennas, bad software / firmware, or cheap chipsets, but the range is terrible."	0
2121	I can be in my bedroom (one room away) and completely lose a signal.	0
2122	"Id give this router an F, and wont be buying another Linksys product again anytime soon."	0
2123	"I replaced this router with an Airport Express, and couldnt be happier at the range or speed!"	1
2124	"Bought this to make use of N speeds our two Sony VAIO laptops and to be able to use the routers USB storage feature for shared folders, backups, etc."	0
2125	"Both laptops are fairly current, run flawlessly on Vista and connect without issues to whatever wifi signal weve ever tried"	0
2126	"After several errors installing the included setup CD, it finally loaded up, and I mean loaded up."	0
2127	Ciscos Network Magic software is a nothing short of a smelly piece of CPU/RAM sucking bloatware.	0
2128	"Good grief, what a mess"	0
2129	"After much trial & error and web searching for people having similar problems, I finally got one of the laptops to connect using some of the tips and settings found online."	0
2130	"Once online, I set about setting up our storage hub, a USB hard drive."	0
2131	Gave up on that a couple of hours in.	0
2132	"Again, using tips from other users having the same issues, including the many postings on Ciscos own support pages, nothing but a dead end"	0
2133	I put that aside for a bit and tried my iPhone 3GS on the connection.	0
2134	"Well, being a G only device, the router must be set to mixed."	1
2135	"When set this way, the laptop connects at G speeds, regardless of its ability to use N. Switch the router to N only and the laptop will then use N and [...] confirms the speed bump, but then of course the iPhone cant connect."	0
2136	"In other words, theres apparently no such thing as mixed with this thing."	0
2137	"Youre either using N or G and if you want to use G any devices, then even the N devices are effectively G only"	1
2138	As for the other laptop?	0
2139	Wouldnt connect any which way to the router.	0
2140	"No way, no how."	0
2141	Tried everything under the sun for over four hours.	0
2142	"Nothing but dead ends, router reboots, unable to connects, and on and on"	0
2143	What a colossal waste of time.	0
2144	It shouldnt be this messy to just hook up a wireless router and its never been with any of the other routers Ive hooked up and used over the many years.	0
2145	Simple as that.	1
2146	This things going straight back to the store	0
2147	"I unhooked and boxed the pile back into its packaging, then hooked up the old Cisco/Linksys WRT54GS it was all set to replace."	1
2148	It worked perfectly just as it has for a long while now.	1
2149	Go figure	0
2150	"Cisco, youve lost your way."	0
2151	Or something.	1
2152	Bought this router back in August of 2008 based on favorable reviews.	0
2153	Very easy to set up...no issues...Have both Mac(mac book pro and imac) and PCs (Dell laptop and Thinkpad laptop).	0
2154	"However, connections would drop every so often...particularly on the macs."	0
2155	"Originally thought it was airport utility on the macs, but problem surfaced on PCs as well."	0
2156	Figured I should update the firmware to the latest version....big mistake....killed my WRT160N v2 router (would no longer dhcp and power light flickered incessantly).	0
2157	Called tech support(India) even though warranty was expired...only after a few minutes of rudimentary tests that Ive actually done myself (reset and power cycle)...they had the audacity to give a sales pitch for worse model and didnt even offer to replace the original one.	0
2158	This left me quite peeved with reservations of ever buying Linksys networking products again.	0
2159	This product just worked ... like my Macs.	1
2160	Had originally purchased a NETGEAR product and could not get it to work properly in my situation and NETGEAR customer support was of no help either.	1
2161	Did have to call Linksys support because of a web site issue when registering the product; the issue was resolved quickly.	0
2162	Configuring the device was intuitive and simple.	1
2163	I expected the router to work faster but it doesnt work as fast as I expected.	1
2164	Whether it is the router or my N adapter I expected a faster wireless connection.	1
2165	"Like one of the customers said, I had high hope for this router, but very disappointed."	0
2166	"A lightning strike fired our old router, which is only a G, so we thought to upgrade based on recommendations from our cable service provider."	0
2167	"After days of research, I decided on this Ultra Range router, boy, have I regret it!"	0
2168	"Set up was not easy, after a call to tech support we finally got it to work."	1
2169	"However, it dropped on and off from time to time"	0
2170	"Ultra Range, what range?"	1
2171	"Unless I am in the room adjacent to it I get low connection and average speed of 2.2 Mbps from my bedroom, which is only separated by kitchen and a big family room (I meant the entire first floor was less than 2,000 sq."	0
2172	feet)!	1
2173	And the no connectivity seems to always happen on the days I have to work from home.	1
2174	"We kept thinking it was the cable service problem, after talking to the tech support the 3rd time I was told the range of this router is about 30 feet!"	0
2175	"We had this router for 3 months, and now Amazon is only willing to refund 1/2 of the purchased price."	1
2176	"Well, I suppose I should be glad at least I get 1/2 of my $ back."	1
2177	"Wireless N, 4x Gigabit Ethernet ports just as advertised."	1
2178	"The user interface works well enough to get everything done that needs to be done, Ive been running it pretty much constantly with several terabytes of data transferred over the years with pretty much no problems at all."	1
2179	"It can get a little warm, but Ive never seen it overheat."	0
2180	Avoid putting it in poor ventilated conditions.	0
2181	Ive had this router for a few years (160n V3) and its been a frustrating experience.	0
2182	"On the positive side, I thought it was easy to setup, has decent range, and its been durable."	1
2183	"However, its quirky and unreliable"	0
2184	"There are frequent issues with IP conflicts, connectivity issues periodically crop up (confirmed as router issues, not modem), and the unit needs to be power cycled every couple days to maintain decent speeds."	0
2185	"After a power cycle, the unit performs very well for a couple days, but performance slowly degrades."	0
2186	"Web pages simply seem a little slow, but streaming video from Youtube or Netflix becomes impossible without another reboot"	0
2187	"In sum, its a frustrating piece of technology."	0
2188	"It performs just well enough (with frequent reboots) that I havent replaced it, but I would strongly discourage anyone from buying this model and Ill likely avoid Cisco when I finally replace it."	0
2189	"Work without any problem and everywhereWork without any problem and everywhere,Work without any problem and everywhereWork without any problem and everywhere"	0
2190	Thanks!	1
2191	Great Product and perfect timing i hace to keep on writing la la la la la la la la!	1
2192	Bought this cause my sister wanted to convert to wifi in her apartmemt.	0
2193	Easy to set up and because it has a guest feature visitors can temporarily use it.	1
2194	Good wireless coverage and cheap	1

2196	I was having issues with my WRT160N router tonight and called Linksys.	0
2197	I did not wait on hold at all and was quickly directed a service rep; Mercury 17103.	0
2198	He was very helpful and friendly and helped me fix the issue quickly.	1
2199	Everthing went well!	1
2200	Great product as described.	1
2201	Will do business again.	1
2202	Awesome company to do business with.	1
2203	The product was exactly what we wanted.	1
2204	Thanks.	1
2205	I got this product is relatively good shape and I am happy with the product.	1
2206	I would recommend this	1
2207	"I have the v3 and since I bought it, 2 years ago, it continuously drops the connection."	1
2208	I have to reset it at least once a day.	0
2209	I write that and I cant understand why I still have it	0
2210	Extremely disappointed.	0
2211	"After returning three WRT54G2 routers that Cisco tech support confirmed to be defective, I thought Id give Linksys/Cisco one more try with this step-up model a try."	0
2212	"The setup program crashed a couple of times, so I configured the router manually and upgraded to the latest firmware."	0
2213	"Everything worked fine for about three days, then Internet performance dropped dramatically and the routers web interface refused connections."	0
2214	"I performed a factory reset and reconfigured from scratch, service restored"	0
2215	"Two days later, the router started refusing Wifi connections."	0
2216	Cisco tech support had me drop security from WPA2 to WPA.	0
2217	"Apparently the router cant support more than two Wifi devices for a prolonged period at the highest encryption level, and at peak I have four Wifi devices."	1
2218	"I switched back to WPA2 a few times, and the router now immediately drops the Wifi devices at the higher encryption setting"	0
2219	Some of the configuration settings either dont stick or cause the router to lock up when setting them.	0
2220	Obviously buggy software is not something one wants to see in a first line security device	0
2221	"I think Ive been very patient, Im very disappointed in Cisco at this point"	0
2222	"Update: 2/10/2010 - After several more issues and oddball excuses from Cisco tech support, I returned the Linksys WRT160N and ordered a Netgear WNDR3700 router to replace it."	0
2223	"The Netgear has a solid feel, robust web interface and just works."	1
2224	"Honestly, after receiving the router over 2 months ago, I couldnt get it working."	0
2225	Went out and purchased a Linksys Wireless Adapter....only to find the signal is never strong enough for me to log on to my laptop	1
2226	"Since, I have been swamped with so many other things that I havent had time to find out why the system is not working."	0
2227	"After several attempts to get this router connected to Comcast service, I gave up."	0
2228	Comcast technicians ( on 2 different occasions) as well as use of Cisco internet suggestions did not help.	1
2229	"Consequently, I am unable to rate this product."	0
2230	the wrt160n works well for establishing a wireless network at home	1
2231	its ez to setup and you will be working within a few min	0
2232	it took me about 15 min.	0
2233	but i had some other prob.	0
2234	i had to overcomefirst to get it and the wireless bridge to work	1
2235	overall i recommend this devise for the home.	1
2236	One star is three stars too many.	0
2237	"At the moment, I am getting a whopping 3kb-14kb download speed with a (wireless) connection that constantly drops out."	0
2238	I bought this to replace my old cheap 6-year-old router which had 30x the speed and 2x the range.	0
2239	From reading other reviews it seems that the default settings are not optimal so I posted to the linksys newsgroup asking for help.	0
2240	"Someone was nice enough to suggest some settings, but that did nothing to solve my problem."	0
2241	"If youre techie (or just bored) and have a weekend to kill tweaking the settings and downloading 3rd party software to replace the original Linksys software, more power to you."	0
2242	"Otherwise, I strongly suggest you buy a different router."	1
2243	This was the V3 version.	0
2244	I work in the computer industry and have an extensive computer hardware and software background.	1
2245	"However, I am not really sure about this Linksys WRT160N router."	0
2246	I installed it without many issues.	0
2247	Basic Internet connection worked.	1
2248	"However, it destroyed my home network."	0
2249	With my old Linksys router I had everything working great.	1
2250	Printing.	1
2251	File sharing.	1
2252	No problems.	0
2253	"However, after installing the new Linksys WRT160N router I could not print to my shared printers or share files."	1
2254	A real disappointment.	0
2255	"I spent the next couple of hours troubleshooting, uninstalling and reinstalling without success."	1
2256	From what I could tell to fully activate shared printing and files Cisco wanted me to buy additional software for the other PCs.	0
2257	I really hate this when a company leads me into buying something only to discover that you need to buy add-on products to make it work correctly.	1
2258	Or at least this as far as I got before I decided the router simply is not worth all of this trouble.	0
2259	Returning this #$&!	0
2260	tomorrow.	1
2261	This router is honestly crap.	0
2262	I upgraded the firmware and tried the port blocking.	1
2263	However it doesnt respect the port blocking rules I set.	1
2264	"I found this wireless router easy to set up, the instructions were very clear."	1
2265	It gives fast speed.	1
2266	Having this router has made my life easier.	0
2267	This router has caused me a bit of problems.	0
2268	"First, it suddenly stopped allowing my Sprint Airave from communicating with the Internet."	0
2269	"Tech support figured that it was something that went haywire with the hardware, so they sent me a replacement."	0
2270	"And indeed, the replacement worked, so somehow, the first one I had just broke on its own"	0
2271	"Now, Im having a hell of a time getting the router to play nice with my XBOX 360 for media center streaming."	0
2272	"Was working just fine for a couple months, and now I have endless problems."	0
2273	It keeps on getting major jitters and will just disconnect my XBOX from the wireless randomly.	0
2274	Im definitely buying a NON-LINKSYS next time.	0
2275	Works fine for wired connections.	1
2276	Wireless connections only sometimes work.	0
2277	I often have to reboot the router and laptop to establish a connection.	0
2278	Didnt work at all until I upgraded the firmware.	1
2279	Wish I had gotten a different router	1
2280	"Update 4/21/10: I thought the firmware update finally had this working, but it turns out there are new problems."	0
2281	"Sometimes when I bring up a web page, it redirects me to [...]."	0
2282	It seems the DNS proxy service that is built into the WRT160N v3 is resolving to the incorrect address.	0
2283	There is a thread on the cisco forums that talks about this.	0
2284	Cisco customer service rudely dismissed my requests for help by denying they had a problem and hanging up on me.[...	0
2285	Plain and simple: Do not buy Linksys Routers.	0
2286	Their routers have major configuration issues and is extremely difficult to set up because their software doesnt configure it automatically like other brands.	0
2287	I bought a brand new HP laptop with windows 7 and bought this WRT160N router.	0
2288	I set it up and it did recognize my SSID name when I connected to that network but when Id go to connect it would say Can not connect or when I was able to connect it would just drop out after a few mins.	0
2289	So I got my money back on this one and purchased the same model elsewhere and still had the same problem.	0
2290	For days I couldnt figure this out so I called Linksys tech.	0
2291	support and went around in circles with them for hours and they didnt know what to do but they did say they could configure the router themselves over the phone but would charge me $9 to do it.	1
2292	"First of all, I didnt pay $80 for a brand new router just so I could pay another $9 for them to reconfigure it when it should have done it automatically."	0
2293	This is ridiculous.	0
2294	I honestly think that Linksys sets their routers up like this on purpose just so they can get more money out of you to reconfigure it	1
2295	My Solution:  Buy the Belkin N+ router.	0
2296	Amazon offers a better price for it though.	1
2297	Works pefectly with no problems at all.	1
2298	Took only 5 mins.	0
2299	to install.	1
2300	It also configures your router automatically so you dont have to unlike the Linksys brand.	0
2301	"If you dont have problems with the Linksys router now you probably will later, especially if your power ever goes out."	0
2302	Its just a matter of time.	0
2303	Buy the Belkin N+ router and youll be able to save yourself a major headache in the future.	0
2304	No problems so far.	0
2305	I had a bit of trouble getting everything synced but thats because I have a Mac and a wireless printer that all had to sync together.	0
2306	"Once it did, its been no trouble, and gives a very good range (full bars one floor down) and nice speed."	1
2307	I am not satisfied at all with this product.	1
2308	I set it up and it gave me problems immediately.	0
2309	When I called Customer Service I had to deal with a lady that barely speaks English and spent an hour on the phone with her and got no where.	1
2310	"Then I called back and spoke with another non speaking gentelman, but he was able to help me somewhat."	0
2311	"My internet works a little over half the time, the other half the wireless doesnt work and I have to plug directly into the modem."	1
2312	I am very displeased that I bought this and will go with NetGear next time I have to buy something.	0
2313	"So I bought this router in March 2009, thinking Id get the Wireless N for hooking up my Xbox, PS3, Wii, and PC Desktop."	1
2314	"While the connectivity with my XBox 360 seemed to be pretty good, as well as the Wifi with my Iphones and Wii, it never really worked well with the most important thing of all, my PC."	1
2315	"When I bought it, it ran Windows XP, and I swear to god it would take forever to pick up a signal and would, in the span of a few minutes drop it."	0
2316	And this is with a WIRED CONNECTION.	0
2317	"So later on, my Pentium 4 dies on me, and I decide to buy a Quad Core from Dell with Windows 7."	0
2318	SAME PROBLEM!	0
2319	"I figure, Ill update the routers firmware and itll fix everything."	0
2320	"Low and behold, I try to update router firmware with official software from their site, and it bricks my router!!!"	0
2321	"I call Linksys and after about 3 separate calls, they finally replace my router."	0
2322	"My refurb arrives after about a week and a half, and get this..."	1
2323	The thing is DEAD ON ARRIVAL!	0
2324	So now I have to wait another week and a half to get another refurbed router!!	0
2325	"This router, is certainly a POS."	0
2326	"As for my shotty connection with my PCs, it turns out that when I plug the 10mbs cable modem directly into my PC, it works like a charm."	1
2327	The problem was with the router all along.	0
2328	I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.	1
2329	"Dont buy it, dont even bother looking at it."	0
2330	It is a piece of crap and the tech support is TERRIBLE!	0
2331	This router is a piece of junk	0
2332	I recently upgraded my services to a cable provider that provides 15 MBs download speed.	0
2333	I have a Linksys WRT54GL and I have had this for quite some time now.	0
2334	I thought since I was upgrading all of my components that I would try and fully utilize my N capabilities on my laptops and with my XBOX wireless connector	1
2335	I was at Best Buy to pick up some shielded CAT5 cable when I saw the deal for this router.	1
2336	I was able to get this for $50 after discounts.	0
2337	"Since I have had nothing but good news with my WRT54GL, I thought I would pick this up."	1
2338	"I should have come to Amazon, as I normally do, and look at the reviews"	1
2339	Onto the Pros and Cons	0
2340	Pros:- Setup was extremely easy via the UI- Configuration through the web portal was the same as my WRT54GL which made it convenient and simple	0
2341	"Cons:- The v3 router is as bad as the v1 and v2 that everyone here is having problems with.- Even with DD-WRT firmware, this thing is a POS.- When my wife turns on our Mac, the router decides to lose all wireless connectivity."	0
2342	"This is a sweet feature.- When using this with P2P software, the download speeds with any other application is completely terrible."	0
2343	This router is more of a switch than a router.	0
2344	The P2P software has limits to 5MB download during the day.	0
2345	This would mean that I still have available 8-10 MBs of download speed.	0
2346	"However, when doing a speed test, I could not get any other computer to get over 2 MBs of download and everything was EXTREMELY sluggish"	0
2347	I tried every possible way to get this thing to work properly but when the last straw was the continued lost of connectivity when turning on our Mac	0
2348	Do yourself a favor and stay away from this router.	1
2349	"If you want to hit yourself in the head and be continuously pissed off, then buy this thing."	0
2350	I will be returning this ASAP and continue to use my WRT54GL until it is dead.	0
2351	"I always get burnt by the old adage of:If it isnt broke, dont fix it."	0
2352	I am in no way computer savvy but had no problem setting up this router.	0
2353	"It works fine for my laptop in the house, but not in the detached garage."	1
2354	Too many walls?	1
2355	Unfortunately this time around I didnt have a great experience with the purchase.	0
2356	Based upon several calls to CISCO the router was deemed to be defective.	0
2357	As is usual with Amazon	1
2358	"com I was able to easily download the return label , etc."	0
2359	and once the return was received by them my refund was processed quickly.	1
2360	"Product: LINSYS Wireless-N RoutersI bought a LINKSYS router that never performed well, and now, after a little more than a year, it has quit working altogether."	1
2361	"When a person walked thru the signal between the router and a wireless receiver, the internet connection would drop."	1
2362	We put up with that for the entire duration that we had it (just a little over a year) until one day when it just quit working.	0
2363	"I tried reloading the Linksys WRT150N software, and at the end of the setup, I got an error message that said that it did not recognize the router (its own router)."	0
2364	Linksys technical support (located in the Philippines) was not helpful or sympathetic--other than the fact they wanted to sell me another piece of junk!BEWARE of the reviews--this product line is TOO CHEAP!!!	0
2365	Do yourself a big favor and buy another brand.	0
2366	"I purchased this router to replace a very old one that still worked, but lacked certain configuration capabilities."	0
2367	I recently purchased a Slingbox to watch TV over the network and the internet and needed port-mapping capabilities to allow me to use it remotely.	1
2368	"I also have an Airport Express that works very well, but I like to take it with me when I travel and dont want to leave my husband netless when I go."	1
2369	"I decided to try this Linksys router, and I went for the N version so I could enjoy speedy wireless."	1
2370	"I started installation manually, without the supplied disk."	0
2371	I figured it was Windows I only.	0
2372	"But when I mounted it, lo and behold, there was a MACINTOSH APPLICATION on it!"	0
2373	"The setup application worked great, generated a secure network key for me and got everything configured quickly and easily."	1
2374	Then I check my speeds.	0
2375	My ethernet-connected computer logged 2.7 mbps.	1
2376	My laptop logged 2.7 mbps when connecting via the Airport Express.	1
2377	"Sadly, the Linksys wireless was only giving me 1 mbps or less."	0
2378	"After checking all of the documentation and visiting the web site (which is frankly quite weak), I called for tech support."	0
2379	The tech I spoke to initially said the device was working properly.	1
2380	"When I said I thought I should return the unit, he recommended trying a firmware upgrade."	0
2381	"I did it, rebooted, and the speed I wanted was then available."	1
2382	The Slingbox works beautifully now too.	1
2383	"So it took a little work, but in the end, the device is doing what I bought it to do."	0
2384	"The connection with my wireless stuff like laptops, printers, etc, doesnt work like 8 times per day is just like no connection at all, any of my computers do not recognize my router, so after several minutes the signal come back (no fun at all), so I call linksys support and under my warranty I have to pay $9.99 to get help, so I paid and they send kind of signal to my router to get fix and works"	1
2385	"This is the worst part: my warranty expired 2 weeks later, and my router stop working again, so I call Linksys and this is what I get: I have to pay $29.99 for 24 hours of warranty to get help from them."	0
2386	What you think?	0
2387	WOW this is a very easy way to take your money.	1
2388	"I dont know how is work the signal to fix my router, but maybe they can use the signal to create conflict in your router and guess what?"	0
2389	you have to pay to fix that	0
2390	I never ever go with linksys again in my life	0
2391	"During the first 2 weeks of use, I had to reformat the WRT160N wireless router on two different occasions."	1
2392	"It will unexpectedly drop Internet connectivity, leaving only the local connection."	0
2393	"After changing a few settings, you will lose the network connection altogether."	0
2394	"Reformatting the router and reinstalling the software took care of the issue for a few days, but this process takes upwards of one hour to complete"	0
2395	"Last night, I contacted Linksys Technical Support for help on the issue."	0
2396	"Their reps were very helpful and helped me again reformat the router, update the firmware (my router has Version 3 hardware), and adjust the settings on the router."	1
2397	"After speaking with 3 different tech support reps over a period of 4.5 hours, it appeared my issues were resolved and my wireless network was working"	0
2398	"However, after turning on my computer today, I have found that while I am connected to the network, I again do not have Internet connectivity."	0
2399	"This has become extremely frustrating, and at this point, I will be boxing up the router and returning it."	0
2400	Linksys tech support was horrible.	0
2401	Router would not connect wirelessly.	0
2402	"After over an hour on the phone, the firmware would not update."	0
2403	They told me to return it to the store!	0
2404	REALLY!!!!	1
2405	I will not be buying another Lynksys	0
2406	"Admittedly, my needs are simple"	0
2407	Bought this to use with the Linksys gaming device WET610N to access netflix movies on my Blu ray player.	0
2408	Did not have wireless service previously.	0
2409	Connected to my Comcast cable modem.	1
2410	Kept my PC on ethernet.	0
2411	Followed instructions on supplied cd.	0
2412	Worked immediately!	1
2413	"Was watching netflix movies within an hour, including time it took me to configure gaming device."	1
2414	"Was delivered three days after ordering, using standard free shipping"	1
2415	I know others were disappointed in the release version that they received.	0
2416	"Mine is version 3.One area that could be improved, is that I have my PC connected via ethernet cable to this router, becasue of my physical setup."	0
2417	"If I turn my router off, I lose my PC connection."	0
2418	"I understand why this is (I think), I just dont like it."	1
2419	I have version 3 and the latest firmware installed.	0
2420	But it seems like the router has some problems with the DNS.	0
2421	Sometime it redirected a site to an IP belong to Akamai Technologies and caused the Invalid URL error.	0
2422	"All the computer in the network had the same error when going to the site that got redirected, not just one computer."	0
2423	Only rebooting the router will fix the problem.	0
2424	I did a search on the web and other people are having the same problem too.	0
2425	"When I tried to ping a site that displays the invalid URL error, it returned the IP 96.17.107.17, which is not the IP of the site."	0
2426	I did a whois and that IP belonged to Akamai Technologies.	0
2427	I opened that IP with a browser and it displayed that same Invalid URL error.	0
2428	Somehow the router redirected a sites IP to an IP belonged to Akamai Technologies.	0
2429	The wireless connection dropped once in a while too.	0
2430	My old Linksys router worked much better than this one.	1
2431	Im going to return it and never buy a Linksys router again.	0
2432	The setup program on the CD would not work.	0
2433	I then had the worst tech support experience in my life!	0
2434	First I paid $9 for the support which did not work.	1
2435	Then I started doing everthing I was told to do.	0
2436	When nothing helped the tech disconnected me!	0
2437	"I assumed that was just an accident, but when it happened with the second tech I woke up."	0
2438	The third tech concluded the router was defective and gave me the Customer Service number.	0
2439	That menu leads right back to tech service and a fourth person.	1
2440	All told I spent over 10 hours jumping through hoops and by that time I didnt even have the internet connection I started with.	0
2441	The fourth rech did all the same things that didnt work before.	1
2442	I had asked for a supervisor but was stonewalled for quite some time until I lost my temper.	0
2443	The supervisor told me I could get a new product by paying $9.99 and the postage to return the DEFECTIVE router.	0
2444	All in all a miserable experience.	0
2445	Dont do it.	0
2446	I went from a Linksys G router that was working fine (other than range)to a new Linksys N router to try to cover a tought reception area of my house.	1
2447	"Bottom line:  things improved slightly, but not as much as I anticipated (hoped)."	1
2448	"On the positive side, setup was very smooth."	1
2449	Router installations have come a long way in the past few years.	0
2450	works well- with rare breakageshad trouble setting up with limited guidance in-box.	0
2451	But pleasure using it after that	1
2452	Purchased this product to share an internet connection with another computer in the household.	1
2453	"Very satisfied with the range of the product, and also the features and quality."	1
2454	"Had to get on help from the website to properly install, but they were very helpful."	1
2455	"I would recommend this product to anyone, and the online help is good also."	1
2456	"Picked up one of these at Best Buy tonight, a version 3, according to the sticker on the bottom of it."	1
2457	"Using wireless, when I had it in the same room as my desktop with a wireless NIC, I would get 54mbit connection, but it took the pages of its config (accessed through a browser) forever to load, sometimes timing out altogether"	0
2458	"When I finally got it totally setup and moved it 2 rooms away (to where my cable drop is), most of the time Windows would time out before it could get connected, and when it did connect, my connection dropped to 12mbit"	0
2459	This thing needs some external antennas and a swift kick in the ass to get moving.	1
2460	Do not buy.	1
2461	"Easy to setup, easy to use and good software that comes with it, but the connections keep dropping if more than one computer is connected over wifi."	1
2462	I purchased this wireless router since I have had good experience with LinkSys product.	1
2463	"And as it turned out, the setup was easy enough for me to understand and it has been pretty reliable so far."	1
2464	I have no complaints on anything.	0
2465	Security feature is great too.	1
2466	Id highly recommend for anyone who wants to upgrade their router.	1
2467	"this router was great for 9 months, never dropped connection all that time, never had to reset.....it reached two floors, all corners of our house and guest house out back."	1
2468	"forget the included cd, you can just use the web interface to configure from any computer."	0
2469	"I had it working with macs, vista, linux using Belkin pcmcia(atheros), intel 2200,rt2870."	0
2470	"had v2, did not buy here."	0
2471	was having difficulty I think with ivp6 under linux so i figured i would upgrade firmware as there was a new version.	0
2472	tried to upgrade via web interface and ethernet connected to xp machine and halfway thru that the router dropped the connection.	0
2473	"resetting, etc., would not revive it."	0
2474	"no longer will router assign ip at all, apparently is bricked."	0
2475	"what stinks is that I didnt do anything wrong, will try warranty i guess."	0
2476	had to break out my old walmart Belkin n-mimo.	0
2477	watch out upgrading firmware.	0
2478	"now reading that maybe should have downgraded,not upgraded the firmware."	0
2479	"oh well..my Belkin is resolving dns just great, stuff loads instantly, unlike the linksys."	1
2480	"If you have a PC this router is great, but if you use mac stay away."	1
2481	Cisco trys to market this product to Mac and while it might work there are no solutions to the problem.	0
2482	It still would timeout while trying to connect.	0
2483	Beware mac users	0
2484	"Executive summary: after initial installation, intermittent network drops, slow speed."	0
2485	Call to tech support resolved it	0
2486	I order the Linksys WRT160N wireless router from Amazon and used the free shipping option.	1
2487	I received the router sooner than originally estimated which was nice.	1
2488	The router is version 3 connected to Comcast cable modem	0
2489	"My Computers/Wireless Devices:HP laptop with Windows 7 and built-in wireless, Dell desktop computer with Windows XP Home (has Netgear  wireless adapter), Apple iPod Touch, Apple Airport Express for streaming music from iTunes to home audio equipment, Brother wireless laser printer, Apple MacBook"	0
2490	Installation:Performed installation from laptop running Windows 7.	0
2491	"There really isnt much to the installation, very few user choices, just security mode,  encryption, pass phrase and SSID name, ."	0
2492	"However, the first installation attempt, the install program could not find internet connection through cable modem."	0
2493	Restoring factory settings to WRT160N and repeating installation again was successful	1
2494	Post-Installation:Internet connection kept dropping out and speed seemed slow.	0
2495	"After hours of reading internet forums, resetting of cable modem and new wireless router I decided to call tech support"	0
2496	Tech Support:The wait time for tech support was under 5 minutes.	1
2497	The rep spoke English and asked pertinent questions  (unlike some of those knuckle heads from India).	0
2498	She was aware of the problem and seemed to know just what to do.	0
2499	"She said the firmware needed updated and she guided me through the installation, reset  the router to factory setting, then reconfiguration of the router via browser settings."	0
2500	"The firmware was updated to v3.0.02 build 004 Nov 29, 2009, she also had me change the channel  from 1 to 9."	0
2501	I also rebooted the PC and the internet connection has not dropped since then.	0
2502	"I was then able to configure the printer, Airport Express, the iPod and the desktop PC  to the network"	1
2503	"Speed/Signal Strength:We live in a 2 story house, about 2000 sq feet."	1
2504	"The wireless router is installed upstairs in the middle bedroom and speed and signal strength has been excellent throughout the houseOverall:So, with less than 1 week using the unit, all is fine now after the unit was updated."	1
2505	"Since I work in the computer/software industry, I understand that problems can occur after product shipment that require updating to work properly (and that non-updated inventory can sit on shelves for some time)."	1
2506	"However, I will not completely let them off the hook on this one."	0
2507	"There is nothing special about my setup as Windows 7 has been released for some time now (and even before it was released, manufactures have access to work with Microsoft prelease software to ensure proper functioning of their products)."	0
2508	I think the problem I experienced is a very common problem that should have been caught and corrected before now or at least Cisco could have alerted customers to problems prior to installation.	0
2509	My old D-Link wireless router finally gave up the ghost and I started looking for a replacement that had a few features my old one didnt.	0
2510	I settled on this device several months ago and Ive been very happy with it.	1
2511	It was easy to set up and it actually looks great sitting on the shelf with no antennas sticking out.	1
2512	Im getting better range out of this than my old one.	1
2513	I like the configuration possibilities.	1
2514	Theyre probably one of the better ones Ive seen short of buying a business class switch for far more money.	1
2515	Ive had no problems whatsoever.	0
2516	"If I have to complain about anything, its the EasyLink Advisor software that you really dont need to configure the device but makes it easy to monitor whats connected to your wireless network."	0
2517	You get a copy on CD but there are updates.	0
2518	You must download it and its quite large - a few hundred megabytes for it and necessary Windows extensions.	0
2519	I live in a rural location with limited bandwidth and data allowances.	0
2520	Even then I could live with that if they would allow me to save it onto my drive and use the same download on my multiple machines.	0
2521	"Instead, I have to re-download it each time for each of my machines.... were talking about a gigabyte if I install on each of my five machines - which I havent."	1
2522	Other than that a great device.	1
2523	I ordered this several months ago because the price was so good.	1
2524	I had it installed before Christmas and it works wonderfully.	1
2525	"It was a hassle, but after a $9.99 service call to Linksys the unit now works perfectly with my Vista laptop and my wifes MacBook with Snow Leopard."	1
2526	Heres the story ... its a cautionary tale of what to expect	0
2527	"When I first installed the router, using the PC, I couldnt get the Mac to access the wireless signal."	1
2528	"I called Linksys customer support, and the tech rep spent an hour having me reset the router, rerun the install process, etc."	1
2529	He finally said that the units defective ... take it back for an exchange	0
2530	"Before shipping it back to Amazon, I decided to try the install one more time."	0
2531	"I reset the router, deleted the software from my PC, and reran the install process."	0
2532	Both the PC and the Mac worked beautifully on wireless.	1
2533	The PC was showing a transfer speed of 54mbps.	1
2534	All was well	1
2535	That evening both my wife and I were getting lousy online response.	0
2536	"When I checked status, I saw that we were getting 1mbps transfer speed - yes, 1 as in one."	0
2537	"Later, we were getting 34."	0
2538	Next morning it was back to 1.Another call to customer support.	0
2539	"This time the tech rep, Sandeep, offered to take remote control of my computer and fix the problem, at a cost of $9.99."	0
2540	"If unsuccessful, he said, there would be no charge."	0
2541	"I said okay, and after I authorized his remote access the cursor started flying around as this clearly well-skilled techie adjusted all manner of settings in the router."	1
2542	"After about 20-25 minutes he said it was done, he took my credit card information, and we said goodbye"	0
2543	"Ive been getting 54mbps ever since, so Im happy."	1
2544	"What Im not happy about, however, is that the standard process for setting up the router didnt do what Sandeep did."	0
2545	Why should we have to pay Linksys ten bucks to get the unit working properly?	0
2546	"Wow, has this been an adventure!"	1
2547	It all started a week ago with the decision to replace our beloved 5 year old 802.11b router with something more up to date.	1
2548	We purchased the Linksys WRT160N because it was on sale and carried the Linksys name.	0
2549	Reading online reviews was done after the fact and boy was it an eye opener.	0
2550	All of the N routers had countless good and bad reviews which made us consider abandoning the upgrade all together.	1
2551	We kept the box unopened pending a decision...In the end we stuck with the Linksys WRT160N because ours was a version 3 and NOT one of the dreaded version 2s.	0
2552	Our serial number starts with CSE41.	0
2553	"Frankly, GoodRead65s review went a long way in giving me the courage to proceed."	1
2554	We followed the initial install instructions to the letter and everything went wonderfully.	1
2555	The wired desktop connected without issue.	0
2556	"Three of our four wireless devices (notebook, netbook, Sirius radio) were close at hand so I installed them and all three connected without issue."	0
2557	"Wow, that was easy!"	1
2558	It was getting late so I decided to leave the 4th wireless device (upstairs desktop) until morning	0
2559	In the morning I went to connect the 4th device and couldnt get it to connect.	0
2560	I turned on the other three wireless devices and NONE of them would connect either!	0
2561	The install process ends with a version of Network Magic getting installed.	0
2562	NM has a nifty network graphical display that showed my wireless devices as connected but the devices themselves were not.	1
2563	"Then suddenly, a device would connect and a NM pop-up would show up to tell me about it."	1
2564	Just as suddenly the connection would go away.	0
2565	The software was also telling me to install NM on my wireless devices which I didnt want to do.	1
2566	I also didnt care for the messages suggesting I buy an upgrade to NM.	0
2567	"I went into the router via the web and verified MAC addresses, the passkey, etc."	0
2568	Still fluky.	0
2569	GoodRead65s unit came with Linksys EasyLink Advisor which he ultimately uninstalled.	1
2570	"I followed suit and uninstalled NM, reset the router, and restarted the devices."	1
2571	Everything worked fine the remainder of the day.	1
2572	I was wondering if NMs constant poling of the network might have been a cause for its fluky behavior.	0
2573	Guess Ill never know...Several reviewers (of earlier versions) mentioned how things took a turn for the worse when updating the firmware.	0
2574	Linksys has an update but were going to stay away unless we encounter problems.	0
2575	Other reviewers spoke highly of third party firmware (DD-WRT) which is available for our version 3 unit so thats an option should we need it.	1
2576	I love this product.	1
2577	It give me the security that I want.	0
2578	It give me the speed for all of the new Computers and it is a true wireless device.	0
2579	The only wire I have going to it is the ethernet wire for the internet.	0
2580	You dont need any computers hooked up to it to create a wireless network.	1
2581	It is great.	1
2582	Mason Stewart.	0
2583	I bought this wireless router to replace an old one that was SLOW....	0
2584	I used it both with a 5-year-old PC and a new MacBook Pro.	0
2585	Have not had any issues with either computers and this router.	0
2586	"While sometimes its not quite as fast as I expect it to be, I can never be sure if its the router, my processor or the cable internet service I have."	0
2587	"Well, I guess with the new MacBook Pro, it shouldnt be the processor."	0
2588	The router was easy to set up both with the computers as well as locking the system (and looks great with my other gadgets) and use.	1
2589	I would recommend it to others.	1
2590	"After reading umpteen online reviews, horror stories & all, I finally decided on the WRT160N."	1
2591	"Trust me, if youre looking for a hands-down winner you wont find it reading reviews - for every user who had a flawless install, there is at least one who couldnt get it to work at all."	1
2592	What reading all those reviews did do is allow me to educate myself on wireless technology and some of the ins/outs of installation.	0
2593	I selected the Linksys router because its Ive been running with a wired Linksys without problem for years now.	0
2594	Caveat: This is my first wireless router so I have no other experience to compare this to	0
2595	The InstallThe WRT160N is impressive out of the box.	1
2596	"Its small, compact, and sleek."	1
2597	"The initial instructions were clear and impossible to screw up, however it took several tries (power on/off) to get the Linksys to recognize my cable modem."	0
2598	After that everything configured beautifully.	1
2599	It wasnt until I started up LELA (Linksys EasyLink Advisor) that I got myself in trouble	0
2600	"While LELA provides you with a graphical display of your connections - in my case 2 wired (XP & 2000) and 2 wireless PCs (Vista) - its dog slow, the settings arent all that intuitive, you still have to use the web tool for advanced configuration, and its not dummy proof."	1
2601	I got into such a state that I started getting errors in the program which were obscure and uninformative.	0
2602	At one point I got locked out of the router which had me reaching for the box and my receipt.	0
2603	"When LELA prompts you for a passphrase stick to characters and numbers, itll let you enter weird characters (&)-!~) but theyre not valid"	0
2604	"And what confounded me most, given the reputation Linksys has: their install program failed to install the manual!"	0
2605	And its not on the CD in an easy to find spot either.	0
2606	I ended up having to pop the CD in again so I could access it from the splash screen.	0
2607	Not only that but LELA itself has no manual or guide...nada	0
2608	"Thankfully, while LELA allows one to get into trouble it does provide a handy get-out-of-trouble tool too."	0
2609	"Another nice thing about LELA is that if you have it running, it will tell you when a new PC is connected which might be important for some."	1
2610	"Still, I preferred the web configuration method and ended up uninstalling LELA."	1
2611	"When all was said and done, it took me about 1.5 hours to install."	1
2612	"Bottom line for installation, be patient and be prepared for some trial and error and to call tech support"	0
2613	"OperationA big concern for me was not so much speed, since I mainly surf, but range and resistance from interference."	0
2614	Not only that but where the router would be installed is the front-most room of my 2-story 3000 sqft house.	1
2615	"However, I had two laptops simultaneously surfing the web from the opposite corner of the house and only was down 1 bar."	1
2616	The only reason I gave it a 4* is that I did see one dropped connection but it did come right back after I rebooted	0
2617	A big disappointment is that Linksys only offers a 1 year warranty; D-Link (I think) offers a 3 year.	0
2618	Another disappointment is their tech support...I had a basic question just recently and wanted to verify something but their online support queue was ridiculously long!!!	0
2619	If youre like me (leaning more toward technophile than technophobe) you should be okay.	1
2620	"But, and this goes for ANY router you buy, SAVE YOUR RECEIPT and EXPECT HICCUPS."	0
2621	"If it doesnt work and you cant get through to tech support return the blasted thing and get a Belkin, D-link, Netgear, etc, etc, etc."	0
2622	Im was very pleased with the ease of set-up.	1
2623	Step by step prompts made it a snap to go wireless.	0
2624	3 days and counting..this router is performing superbly.	1
2625	Extremely easy to set up.	1
2626	I have a 3 story home.	1
2627	The router is on the 3rd floor and my laptop and wireless printer are located on the first floor.	1
2628	I get excellent reception throughout.	1
2629	"PSP, iPhone and Wii all have absolutely no problems with connectivity."	0
2630	First bought G-router of the same brand.	0
2631	It took about 2 h to finally set-up wireless connection.	0
2632	It worked fine on the first day but on the second day it became slow and eventually stopped working.	0
2633	It was not my computer since all my 3 laptops and 2 iphones did not detect wireless signal.	0
2634	"Thinking that it might be the defect of that specific unit, returned and switched to N-router."	0
2635	Same thing happened; took several hours to set-up/worked on the first day/stopped working on the second day.	1
2636	Returned and switched to Netgear.	1
2637	Took me less than 30 min to set up everything and start to surf the web by wireless in no time.	0
2638	NEVER EVER buy Linksys.	0
2639	"I bought the Linksys N Wireless Router and after seven hours of installation and multiple errors, blue cable did not work in slot 4, router would only allow two computers, I called customer support."	0
2640	"Obviously based out of India, the support was no help, I could not understand a word they said, and they hung up on me when I asked them to repeat what they were trying to say."	0
2641	"I guess thats how you keep your customers, put a product on the market that doesnt work, hire customer support people who cannot speak English and hang up on their customers, by the way, customers pay your salary whether you know it or not, and dont allow anyone to contact you on your website"	0
2642	I will not ever buy anything from Linksys or Cisco again.	0
2643	They took a day out of my life that I will not forget.	0
2644	"Oh, I am very computer literate, Ive done many installations at large corporations."	0
2645	This router replaced an older 802.11g router that had died.	0
2646	I was amazed at how much simpler setup had become since I last bought a router.	0
2647	"We were up in running in no time, and customization was a snap."	0
2648	"The move from g to n has been a real eye opener, now it is hard to tell the difference in speed between wired and wireless connections."	0
2649	It works well with both Windows and Mac laptops.	1
2650	"So far, we are very happy with this product."	1
2651	The short story is that the product failed after a few weeks and the Customer Service was dreadful!	0
2652	"I used to be an avid supporter of Linksys products and have owned many products, with good results."	1
2653	"But, the experience of having to deal with Customer Service when their router failed was not a pleasant one"	0
2654	The router was good for a few weeks.	1
2655	"Then, during a firmware upgrade, it failed."	0
2656	"After talking with a Technical Support person from Linksys, it was determined that the router was defective."	0
2657	A Customer Service phone number was provided but the Technical Support person could not connect me.	0
2658	"So, that was another call."	0
2659	"When that number brought me to the same same Technical Support area, I was somewhat fumed."	1
2660	I asked to have them dial Customer Support.	0
2661	"After discussing the problem again with Customer Service, they had me send in the original packing slip via fax."	0
2662	"A day after faxing the information, I received another call"	0
2663	"When the call came from this Customer Service representative, instructions were provided to go on the web and start the return process."	0
2664	This involved deciding whether to have the router shipped or a new one shipped to me first.	0
2665	It was at this time it was stated that shipping charges there and back would be my cost	0
2666	"So, to get this straight, a product that was defective from the manufacturer, causing a great amount of my time to diagnose, and then go through the Technical Support and Customer Service over a few days is now requiring that more is to be paid for shipping so as to have it corrected?"	0
2667	I think not.	0
2668	"And, to think I have been a loyal Linksys customer all this time."	1
2669	Didnt this kind of service go away even before the change in the economy.	0
2670	Maybe its a case of Cisco not catering to then home user anymore.	0
2671	Not sure.	0
2672	Its been quite irratating however	0
2673	"So, I am returning the product for a refund."	1
2674	Maybe Linksys could let me know if you they change your policies and quality back to the way things used to be.	0
2675	"Upgraded to wireless-N router, replaced a d-Link G.  The connection speed was really high, and the signal was really strong, but it wouldnt hold a connection on the internet itself."	1
2676	Always prompting me to repair the connection.	0
2677	"I called Linksys, they tried hard to help, upgraded firmware, changed settings etc, they finally said bring it back, it must be defective."	0
2678	"Awesome customer support, lousy product."	1
2679	"Amazon return, so far, has been fine and easy."	1
2680	"I got a refurbished unit from electronica, for aroun [...] bucks."	0
2681	"At first i was a little skeptical, not being used to buy refurbished items (with the added risk of living outside the U"	0
2682	"S, for the guarantee and so on): , but i really wanted to give a try to a top notch brand and unit, so i went for it, and i am deeply pleased."	1
2683	"I guess i lasted less than one hour or so setting it up (even given my usual habit of not reading manuals, which usually add some delays), ive got all my wireless devices working flawlesly (mobile phone and laptop basically).Hope that it lasts, or at least if its going to fail, itll show before the 90 days guarantee"	0
2684	"Ive never been dissapointed by Amazon, hope it keeps the same"	0
2685	"After 4 months with the product, im still looking for a flaw."	0
2686	Just a consistent and reliable product with excelent performance.	1
2687	I keep it working 24/7	0
2688	I bought a new laptop and bought this because it seemed like it was best suited to my needs.	1
2689	"Unfortunately, the first time I used it, it was extremely slow."	0
2690	The router is located only a room away.	0
2691	"For the first few uses, I had to hook up and reconnect it in order for it to acknowledge the router."	0
2692	"Then, one day it seemed to connect and all was well for about two weeks."	1
2693	"Yesterday, I started losing connection again."	0
2694	"Now, again, this evening it cannot find the connection."	0
2695	The laptop is sitting three feet from the router.	1
2696	I have tried reinstalling/repairing the software but to no avail.	0
2697	"It is a nice-looking unit and it was easy to install but if it doesnt work more than 50 percent of the time (Ive had it about about a month), then it is worthless to me."	1
2698	I would not recommend this product.	1
2699	It is unreliable and I am very disappointed.	0
2700	Ive been using Linksys wireless routers since I first got broadband.	0
2701	"Theyve never been attractive routers, but theyve always gotten the job done and its been so easy upgrading from one model to the next"	1
2702	"That is, until now."	0
2703	"I bought this to replace my wireless-G router, as it occasionally struggles to keep up with wireless audio streaming."	0
2704	"As a plus, its a more attractive router than the typical black & blue box."	1
2705	"Setup wasnt too bad, until I tried to get it to recognize my wireless-N Airport Express, which took forever (Apple customer support was infinitely more helpful than Cisco/Linksys)."	0
2706	"After finally getting everything up and running, I tried going about my life and I could not hold a signal on any computer for any length of time."	0
2707	Connections were constantly reset and I spent all my time waiting to pick up the signal again.	1
2708	"In between these drops, I didnt have the audio streaming problems that I had with my wireless-G Linksys router, but it doesnt do me very good if I still lose the streaming, as well as my Internet connection, constantly."	0
2709	"After seemingly endless troubleshooting, updating firmware, changing settings, etc., I finally gave up"	0
2710	This router made me give up on wireless-N for the time being.	0
2711	"And when I finally do buy a new router, I dont think Ill go back to Linksys again."	0
2712	This product is terrible.	0
2713	I had to work with tech support for an hour to get it up and running.	1
2714	It was running great for two weeks and then stopped working.	1
2715	I called tech support and they couldnt help.	1
2716	I am very familiar with computers and advise people not to buy this product.	1
2717	THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT I EVER OWNED!!!!!!!	0
2718	This router might be OK if you just want to web browse or send/receive short emails.	1
2719	But dont expect great performance.	1
2720	"Even after two firmware upgrades, Linksys still has it so buggy that many functions just dont work or are so unreliable they are unusable."	0
2721	Need UPnP (for using MSN or other online programs)?	0
2722	"Forget it, UPnP on this router does not work (its listed as a feature but it doesnt work in any firmware revision).The router bogs down on heavy file transfers, becoming slow as molasses."	0
2723	Need to get the configuration screen?	0
2724	You have to reboot the router otherwise the web-based configuration screens take forever to display.	0
2725	Want to use Bittorrent for file transfers?	0
2726	"Sorry, the router just cant handle the number of connections required and will either get so slow or just freeze altogether, requiring a reboot"	0
2727	"First off, the WRT160N is really beautiful to look at."	1
2728	"We bought this router primarily because we needed a fast router for our home network (since we planned to play games a lot on it) , and one with a large enough range"	1
2729	"The initial setup of the router is pretty straightforward, and if you know the basics of setting up a router, it should be a breeze."	1
2730	"There were no glitches and no hiccups except the wireless channel to use, but thats due to the interference around here."	0
2731	"A few days later, we noticed that setting the router to AUTO(20 or 40Mhz) caused to router to drop all wireless G clients off every few minutes."	0
2732	A little tweaking fixed that	0
2733	"After a few months of usage, I have one major gripe about this."	0
2734	"I need to reboot this router at least once a week, because it tends to drop all wireless G connections while maintaining the wireless N ones."	0
2735	"Also, once in a while, the internet transfer speeds slow to a crawl."	0
2736	"Im not sure whats wrong, since a simple disconnect and reconnect of the power cable fixes it every time."	0
2737	If you want a wireless network in your house dont buy this router.	1
2738	It has no range.	1
2739	I am 30 feet from it downstairs and I bearly get a signal.	0
2740	This was a great deal for the price and features.	1
2741	"Its a factory refurbished unit, but I have a factory refurbished HDTV thats going on 5yrs old with no problems!!!"	0
2742	"It has a 90 day warranty, and for the money you cant go wrong."	0
2743	"It was incredibly easy to set up an get going, the instructions are idiot proof and walk you through everything step by step, in under 5 mins I had 2 desktops hard wired and 1 laptop wireless all running online smooth as could be."	1
2744	"Love the sleek low profile look, and the range is amazing, I live in an old apartment with concrete walls and had to upgrade my cordless phones to get signal in all the rooms, this router gets me great signal in every room and outside!!"	1
2745	"First, I have to say that I dont have a lot of skills with wireless networks."	0
2746	"Bought this for my mother because it was much cheaper than retail, and I have had good experiences with other Linksys products."	1
2747	I have to reset this thing quite often.	0
2748	"Also, I have a hard time connecting to the secure network."	0
2749	"Decided to try the D-link because of the positive reviews, and it is much better."	1
2750	Well document and organized setup package.	0
2751	"If you can read and follow instructions, Ill bet you can install this router successfully."	1
2752	Well done Cisco.	1
2753	I set this up only to have the worst connections I have seen in about 6 years on a wireless router.	0
2754	I had ONE device on it and the speed was similar to a network of 2 soup cans with some string.	0
2755	Linksys customer service remains the same it has been for years (terrible) so I had to return this abomination of a router.	0
2756	My old WRT54G2 router from Linksys was much better than this and I got that one years ago.	1
2757	It died out and I got this as a better replacement.	0
2758	"It is my own fault, however, that I never read the memo that better means slower, less reliable and just horrible in general."	0
2759	Nothing could connect to it or recognize it all the time.	0
2760	"I have a notebook, iphone, and a usb network adapter."	1
2761	all connected to my other router just fine.	1
2762	Dont waste your time or money	0
2763	"After 6 months of having to reset the router every day, Im getting a different router."	0
2764	"I have the latest firmware, but that does not help."	0
2765	I should have pulled (permanently) the plug alot sooner....	0
2766	"I just buy this with my new PC because my PC has wireless built-in, but turn out this connection is very weak and lost signal every 10 - 15 minutes, my PC just locate 5 feet from this router."	0
2767	"I tried to connect the cable instead of using wireless, same, very slow and unstable."	0
2768	"Not able to complete download one song, or view on-line song more than 5 second......, it took minute to open each website, too slow and lost connection too often."	0
2769	"Without using this piece, I use dial-in connection and it is faster."	0
2770	Very disappointed.	0
2771	I thought Id give it a try even after reading some bad reviews.	0
2772	I got my laptop connected 1Mbps at times!	0
2773	My HP TV had hard time connecting and once connected at so slow a speed; I decided to switch back to my US Robotics G router.	0
2774	I played around with different params to no avail.	1
2775	Piece of junk indeed!	0
2776	Avoid this!Review for the latest firmware v3.	0
2777	Dont waste your money or your time.	0
2778	I replaced an old Netgear WGT624 wireless router that worked flawlessly for years but hasnt been supported by Netgear for years.	1
2779	I bought a new W7computer and wanted a new router along with it.	0
2780	"To make a long story short, I tried 3 of these units before giving up."	0
2781	A Linksys tech.	0
2782	told me to return the first unit after we couldnt get it to work.	1
2783	The second unit was the same as the first.	0
2784	The last unit was on my desk next to the computer yet I continually lost the signal.	0
2785	"When I pulled the cable feed from the router and plugged it into the computer, the computer connected to the internet with no problem."	0
2786	I left it on line all evening and never lost the signal.	0
2787	I wish I could charge Linksys for the hours I spent trying to make their defective product work.	0
2788	"I was having dropout issues with my WRT54G router and had read that the WRTN160N had less problems with interference from cordless phones, etc."	0
2789	After ordering the WRT160N router I found a firmware update that fixed the issues I was having with my wireless G router.	0
2790	I read about a lot of issues with the WRT160N router and was a little apprehensive about replacing it when the refurbished one came in.	0
2791	I had also purchased an N notebook adapter	1
2792	"I had absolutely no problem setting the router and adapter up and the software even copied the settings from my wireless G router so that I would not have to make any changes on my XBOX360, Wii and Samsung Wireless Blueray player."	0
2793	The signal strength is much better than with a G router and the speed is impressive.	1
2794	"For right on 50 dollars(router and adapter), I have a much faster and more reliable router."	1
2795	I think the router is a good buy and essential for video streaming.	1
2796	I am not a technician.	1
2797	"I am a very proficient user, with a lot of experience using corporate and personal networks going back 20 years."	1
2798	Here is what I can tell you about this router.	0
2799	It often times out before a website will come up -- even a fast one like Google.	0
2800	"I have to hit the refresh key, and then it appears."	1
2801	It often just wont work.	0
2802	"I have to unplug it, and then plug it back in."	0
2803	Then it works.	1
2804	How do I know the problem is the router and not some other part of the chain?	0
2805	Two reasons.	0
2806	"First, I didnt have this problem with my old router before it died."	0
2807	"And second, I dont have these problems at work."	0
2808	"So I dont know exactly what the problems are, or what a better router is, but if youre like me and you just want something that works well, Id suggest you try a different one."	1
2809	This one will disappoint you.	0
2810	Great router; replaced my D-Link unit with this one	1
2811	"Good range, reliable, very easy to manage"	1
2812	After purchase it took a lot of research just to get it going on my 64bit vista system.	1
2813	After several tweaks and a firmware downgrade which I eventually found on Linksys forums I got it up and running.	0
2814	It worked for a while but then started having all sorts of problems accessing the internet.	0
2815	Finally I sat through an hour of tech support that finally installed newer firmware that had just come out only to crash the whole unit.	0
2816	Then I was subjected to a torturous process to send it back for a replacement only!	0
2817	Why would I want another one of these?	0
2818	Linksys was awful to deal with.	0
2819	I have been using Linksys equipment for at least a decade and have watched the quality fall so far.	0
2820	The only reason I kept going back is because I was familiar with it.	0
2821	No More!	0
2822	"Im done with Linksys, they just rush things out now to try and be cutting edge."	1
2823	I originally purchased a v2 of this router but it died on me after a couple of weeks.	0
2824	Linksys replaced it with a v3 which occasionally resets all settings to default.	0
2825	Often loses connectivity to my different devices.	0
2826	Its incredibly frustrating.	0
2827	Each day when I get home from work I have to spend five minutes making sure its configured correctly	1
2828	Ill admit to being a little naive about the benefits of upgrading from a G to an N router.	0
2829	I actually thought it would make a difference.	0
2830	For almost everything you might want to do in a home network environment wirelessly their are no real advantages to having an N router versus a G router.	1
2831	My assumption was that Id be able to stream media at higher rates.	0
2832	Well the rates are higher but still below the rate that makes any difference.	1
2833	A wireless N router does not enable you to stream at DVD bitrates between two wireless devices	0
2834	If you want speed go buy some cat5 cables.	0
2835	****EDIT****  The firmware that came out for this at the beginning of Dec. 2009 has made this pretty stable.	1
2836	"The dissatisfaction hasnt changed too much, Ive upped my review from 1 to 2 stars."	0
2837	Problem getting set up with laptop	0
2838	Remember gotta program correct nmbrs	1
2839	in laptop as PC..	1
2840	This thing constantly drop your wireless connection and doesnt preform to true wireless N standards.	0
2841	I thought I was getting wireless N for value but all I got was a nightmare that left me using as a wired router until I finally replaced it.	0
2842	"I bought this router thinking it would be faster, with a better range."	1
2843	It may be both of these things if it actually worked	1
2844	"It was very easy to set up out of the box, but it would drop wireless connections all the time to the point that it became basically unusable."	0
2845	"I looked up the issues on the net, and found you need to update the firmware -- from the Linksys web site."	0
2846	"I said fine, whatever, so I updated the firmware."	1
2847	"Then it worked mostly fine except every once in a while, it still dropped connections."	1
2848	"Every once in a while, I had to unplug the power and plug it back in just to get it working again"	0
2849	I called Linksys and tech support simply tells you to reset to factory settings and run the setup.	0
2850	As if I hadnt done that a million times myself.	1
2851	So I decided to return it and get a Netgear -- which works fine.	1
2852	"I have a computer, xbox 360, and a PS3 that all work great wirelessly with this router."	1
2853	The Linksys WRT160N is junk.	0
2854	I have had it for three months and it has never worked right.	1
2855	"I even bought a new computer, thinking that with an old computer and a new router the computer must be the problem."	0
2856	"But I get the same problems with the new, faster computer."	0
2857	The Linksys works only intermittently.	0
2858	"About 1/2 of the time after startup I get messages that Explorer cannot load the web page, or that my email server does not exist."	0
2859	"If I take the time to shut everything off and start over then it usually connects, but not always."	0
2860	"And any connection can be lost within a few minutes, unpredictably."	0
2861	"Now that I know the problem isnt in the computer (and Ive also checked that it is not the internet cable connection), Ill be trying a different brand of router."	0
2862	I bought this as a reconditioned unit and was very happy with it.	1
2863	The set up was fast and easy.	1
2864	Just put in the CD and follow the instructions!	0
2865	The range is more that adaquate for my use.	1
2866	All Im doing is WiFI for my home and it works perfictly.	1
2867	I spent several hours trying to make this router work.	1
2868	"The device is slick, the setup CD is very easy to use."	1
2869	Wired connection worked just fine.	1
2870	Not so with wireless.	1
2871	"It would barely connect, then work slower than 56k dialup, then drop the connection altogether."	0
2872	"I tried and tried, with two different laptops using different wireless chips."	0
2873	No luck.	1
2874	I searched the Net--turns out  this model has a known issue with DNS support.	0
2875	It has been described and discussed on the forums for more than a year.	0
2876	In the meantime Linksys introduced a new hardware/firmware combination (v3) but it looks like this issue has not been fixed still.	0
2877	Incredible	1
2878	In desperation I even contacted product support.	0
2879	"The guy on the other side was nice enough but he could not help me either, he just paced me through standard motions of resetting the thing to factory settings etc"	1
2880	That was yesterday.	1
2881	Today I returned the thing and got a DLink DIR-628 instead.	0
2882	"I do not know how reliable DLink device will be in the long run, but it took me 10 minutes to get it up and running."	1
2883	I feel better now.	1
2884	"First, understand that I upgraded from Vista to Windows 7 so some of my experience MAY be related."	0
2885	"However, I ordered and received this router and went through the install process as instructed in the accompanying instructions when I encountered an error which had me on the telephone with Cicsos tech support (in India) for a couple hours."	0
2886	"Finally, it was working."	0
2887	"Be aware, however, that if you want Cisco to do the install you have to pay extra."	0
2888	"They will, however, walk you through it on the phone for free even though that takes them (and you) about four times as long."	0
2889	Then I powered the PC down for the night.	0
2890	"The next morning, the PC connected to the router could not access the internet through the router but my laptop, using the wireless feature, could."	0
2891	Go figure.	0
2892	"Another call to tech support with a reference to the preveious evenings festivities had them asking me to move my gear all over the place, try this and try that, all to debug their software/hardware issues"	0
2893	"In the end, the tech support person threw up his hands and surrendered."	1
2894	He claimed that it was due to issues with Windows 7.	0
2895	Maybe.	0
2896	"I dont know and, very frankly, I dont care."	0
2897	The product could not be installed and did not work consistently when it was installed.	1
2898	The tech nsupport took forever and when they finally reached the bottom of the explanations barrel they blamed it on Microsofts operating system.	1
2899	That may be correct.	1
2900	I am not making a judgement about that.	0
2901	"I am simply warning other customers to be aware that I had a failed installation and returned the item as defective which, to me, it was."	0
2902	"But, the support organization is weak and out of date (Windows 7 implementation was announced long ago and beta versions for testing have been available for a long time...Cisco was caught, apparently, completely by surprise...not an encouraging event for a major software/hardware vendor)."	0
2903	"And, they do not hesitate to have you, the customer, go to extraordinary efforts to debug their products."	1
2904	"I am have home computer, not a business IT department with network engineers"	1
2905	I will be very reluctant to buy any products or services from this vencor again.	0
2906	"You, too, have been warned!"	0
2907	"Just before installing it, my advise is to call linksys and install it step by step with them."	1
2908	The problem is that it keeps on changing the IP address; how?	0
2909	I have no idea!!!	0
2910	"Generally after the IP is stable, the router is good."	1
2911	November 2011-Still working without a hitch	0
2912	"Dec 30, 2009 update..."	1
2913	I have had this unit for 2 months now and it has been reliable with no down time.	0
2914	I am glad that I bought this router.	1
2915	I had a very helpful person when I called customer service who made sure the router worked before ending the call.	1
2916	At this point I have no complaints	0
2917	Call LinkSYS 800-546-5797 to help you with install problems.	0
2918	I read a review about the install CD not being helpful but purchesed it anyway.	1
2919	I have to say that I ran into the same install problem.	0
2920	The CD could not complete the setup.	0
2921	I contacted the merchant and was told to call the manufacturer for tech support.	1
2922	It took a while with tech support but I got it working.	1
2923	I suggest that before getting frustrated and returning the router call LinkSYS for support.	0
2924	It was not something that I could have done on my own because there are lots of settings that were determined by tech support.	0
2925	Hope this helps anyone who is having problems with installing this router.	0
2926	"I have troubles connecting a hub to this router, and using it for other functions, i"	0
2927	e.	1
2928	lan parties/xbox connectivity	0
2929	"In addition, occasionally it will drop my wireless signal when I am connected and in the room next door"	0
2930	Also I can only detect the signal occasionally when I am downstairs	0
2931	"I also do not like the huge amount of time it takes when I press the Wi-Fi Protected Function, along with my linksys Dual Band Wireless-N USB adapter and they never connect with this supposedly simple and awesome function."	1
2932	"=/I am unhappy with it, I expected more, it seems as if I am just as better off with my linksys b/g router =(However, the wired connectivity has been solid, as expected.-mcEDIT, update the firmware, and it is a solid router."	1
2933	Dang it why couldnt you have better firmware preinstalled.	1
2934	It was very easy to set up.	1
2935	I didnt have any problems whatsoever.	0
2936	Ive used it for about a month.	0
2937	Looks great too.	1
2938	Cant speak for the range though but worked great in my 2 bedroom apartment.	1
2939	If all you need is wireless connectivity from various rooms in your apt this works great.	1
2940	"I cant believe Amazon shows this as 4+ stars, when nearly half of reviewers gave it only 1 star"	0
2941	"Summary:* Terrible setup experience; loads hundreds of megabytes of crapware on your computer* Incredibly slow setup* Locally-run software is of terrible quality; lots of UI glitches, things that dont work* Hardware massively unreliable (I bought two of these things; stupid me)."	0
2942	"Crashed constantlyTo set the context, I have been configuring and using Network equipment for 15+ years, and have been using wireless routers at my home since wireless routers were first brought to market."	0
2943	"I currently have both a Netgear and D-Link wireless router running at home (my house is large).Today I bought two new N Ultra Range Plus routers, assuming that the Cisco brand name was trustworthy, and based on the marketing materials."	1
2944	"Several hours of frustration later, I am re-packaging both to return them."	0
2945	"Of the 10+ wireless routers Ive owned, and many more wireless adapters, these unquestionably are the worst quality and most poorly designed"	0
2946	"For starters, the packaging insists that you run a configuration CD to configure the router."	0
2947	There is a sticker over the power connector to prevent you from plugging in the router without first running the CD.	1
2948	"This is the year 2009: why do you need anything more than a web browser to configure this router?After you insert the CD, you have to actually go double-click."	0
2949	The autorun just doesnt work.	1
2950	"When you double-click, it throws a UAC security warning, forces you to give administrative privileges (WHY?!?"	0
2951	", and then runs a setup."	1
2952	"When the setup completes, you are encouraged to install some bundled (and completely unrelated) anti-virus software."	0
2953	"I already have anti-virus on my laptop -- I bought a freekin router, not anti-virus -- WHY does Cisco insist on upgrading my laptop?The window that comes up is glitchy with overlapping text on the UI."	0
2954	"I have a very high DPI monitor, so I use 150dpi fonts."	0
2955	Cisco apparently never thought to test on any expensive modern laptops.	0
2956	"Maybe they should think about using a web browser to configure the router...Next, youre asked to accept a license agreement for the software."	0
2957	"Even if you didnt want their stupid software, and you only want to instally the *hardware* you bought, you are forced to accept the license agreement before continuing."	0
2958	"Why?Next, you learn that you cannot perform initial router setup without having the router connected physically to the Internet *and* to your laptop?"	0
2959	Huh?	0
2960	Are they kidding?	0
2961	Thats utterly insane.	0
2962	"None of my other routers have ever required this: you should be able to complete the basic setup through a web browser through local connection to laptop, then connect to the Internet and perform the rest of the setup wirelessly"	0
2963	Sigh...	0
2964	I drag my laptop and all of the cords out to the cold garage and plug in physcal cables	0
2965	"Next, following the prompts for setup router for first time, the software churns for about 10 minutes."	0
2966	"Surprise, surprise -- the router password is not permitted to have punctuation, but the WPA password is."	1
2967	"Really intelligent, Cisco"	1
2968	It pretends it cannot find the cable modem.	0
2969	"I walk over and reboot the cable modem, and come back to restart the setup"	0
2970	Guess what?	0
2971	"When you re-launch the program, it launches the UAC security prompt again."	1
2972	It installs again.	0
2973	It forces you to accept the license agreement AGAIN.	0
2974	"Yes, it does this EVERY time (I had to do setup 3 times).Unfortunately, this easy setup program does not allow configuration of basic settings like IP subnet."	0
2975	"Once I have the easy setup configured, I need to configure the advanced settings."	1
2976	"To do this, Im guided to click on the setup advisor button"	0
2977	Clicking this button sets off ANOTHER install process that puts hundreds of MB of crap on my hard drive.	0
2978	It installs Java Runtime without my permission -- I am not even supposed to install that due to security issues in JRE.	0
2979	"After 10 minutes of install, as my laptop battery depletes due to thrashing CD and hard drive, the setup advisor finally runs"	0
2980	"Oh, great!"	1
2981	"It installed a program in my taskbar notification area, because thats what I always WANTED!"	0
2982	"Some program to configure my router, running at all times and taking system resources."	1
2983	"Thanks, Cisco!The launch screen gives me four choices -- but NONE of the choices are to configure the router."	1
2984	"I have to hit exit, then click on a picture of the router and choose advanced configuration."	1
2985	"Really intuitive, Cisco"	1
2986	"Now the big surprise:  when I finally find the way to launch advanced config, it launches a web browser."	1
2987	"After all of this, NOW the router allows configuration via web browser."	0
2988	"Seriously, Cisco?"	1
2989	Why couldnt you just allow browser-based config from the start?	0
2990	"Oh, I know!"	0
2991	Because then you wouldnt have a chance to install the crappy JRE and try to upsell me on unnecessary anti-virus	0
2992	"At this point, Im just happy to be done, and hoping to walk away and never touch the stupid thing again."	0
2993	But the connection to the WAN crashes.	0
2994	It literally crashes my cable modem.	0
2995	"The cable modem is literally frozen, and needs power to be bounced."	0
2996	"After being restarted, everything works fine for a few minutes, before crashing the cable modem again."	1
2997	It never runs for more than 10 minutes	1
2998	I switch back to D-Link; everything runs fine (Im writing this review through D-Link).	1
2999	Switch to the other Cisco router; same problem.	0
3000	Apparently Cisco is unreliable.	0
3001	Back to D-Link (or Netgear).This product is absolute garbage; staggeringly poor.	0
3002	As an owner of a computer company & a ton of experience with routers of all ages here is the FLAT LINE with this product.	0
3003	"If your not ready to convert all of your wireless products over to Linksys, then stay clear of this product."	1
3004	"It works fine with the newer Linksys network adapters but, if your using anything of any age at all or dose not retain the Linksys brand name it will give you trouble."	0
3005	I have switched most every customer that has purchased this router (& all newer linksys products) over to another brand names.	0
3006	Mainly D-Link for most american homes & small businesses) Linksys is living off of there business class products which are vary good in most cases.	1
3007	I have yet to find a wireless product from Linksys that did not cause head aches for most all of its users!!	0
3008	GOOD LUCK!	1
3009	"I use this router as a core of a wireless net which hold 7 computers 1 type machine, and 2 i-touches."	0
3010	"During one month, it dumped once."	0
3011	"Generally, it is not bad."	0
3012	I have a older (2002) LinkSys 802.11b router that significantly outperformed this new WRT160N router.	1
3013	"As an example, one laptop failed to connect or connect intermittently, and when it connects, it records download speeds from my ISP at less than 1Mbps compared to >10Mbps when the laptop is placed by the router."	0
3014	"When considering that the laptop connected to the 802.11b, The performance is utterly unacceptable."	0
3015	I have confirmed similar performance with another newer laptop.	0
3016	No complaints.	0
3017	Bought it for my dad about a month ago and its been operating flawlessly.	1
3018	This is my second Linksys router.	0
3019	The instructions to set it up make it sound like a child could do it.	1
3020	"The truth is, there is no troubleshooting instructions included with the router, only very simple setup which didnt work."	0
3021	Both times I called Linksys and they had to set it up remotely...at a price of $9.99 each time.	1
3022	To me that is not very ethical.	1
3023	Each time it took the techs a couple of hours over the phone to set it up.	0
3024	"The truth is, the second time, I finally got a female tech, that did it in one minute."	0
3025	It turns out there is just one simple enable wireless connection check mark that has to be checked.	0
3026	"There is nothing in the instructions to tell you that, it just keeps telling you to re-install."	0
3027	"Im not sure now where to find that enable if I had to do it over again, but believe me, I will find it & save $9.99 ."	0
3028	"If I didnt have to pay the extra $9.99 two times, this would be a great value, but under the circumstances I had to give it a low value mark."	1
3029	"I have bought this one from Best Buy, but promptly returned in one week."	1
3030	"The set up was not easy, too many steps and finally the wireless was dropping connection frequently."	0
3031	Tried all the technical set up options and nothing worked.	1
3032	Finally decided to return it and picked Belkin N router.	0
3033	Very easy to set up (less than 15 minutes) and no troubles at all.	0
3034	I am on line in 5 minutes and no issues since then.	0
3035	"I strongly discourage people from buying this router, especially the latest version"	0
3036	Best of luck if you are in the market for Wireless Routers.	1
3037	Our new router is much more reliable and faster than our old one.	1
3038	We are very happy that we are not constantly loosing our internet connection and having to reset the router!	1
3039	"Our previous router died last week, and, rather than live tied to the corner where the signal comes in, I raced out to a major retailer and stopped, awed, by the billion billion choices presented as replacement routers."	0
3040	"The broken router was a Linksys, but I had no recollection why, and said giant behemoth of a retailer pays conversely tiny wages, though they provide them with extremely unattractive blue uniforms, so no sales person was available to discuss the relative merits of the different brands."	0
3041	"I decided that I would give up monogamy, and went with a net-gear WNP2000, a relatively high end product."	0
3042	I spent the next week trying to install the p	1
3043	o	0
3044	"s.. More than 5 hours on the phone with their technical support staff in the Philippines, who managed to be both condescending and stupid, with accents that required constant repetition of each instruction."	0
3045	"By the beginning of this week, after hours of solo effort, I had three guys from our internet providers service, here trying to make it work too."	0
3046	"It was a dastardly paperweight, or hockey puck, but definitely no router."	0
3047	"Yesterday evening I purchased a Linksys router model WRT160N, from a charming young lady who seemed very well trained, wearing her own clothes, in a different store."	1
3048	She began by asking what kind of system it would be plugged into.	0
3049	"I sat down maybe 15 minutes ago, popped in the c"	0
3050	"d., and I am now on the Amazon site writing this review."	1
3051	Now thats my idea of a router.	0
3052	"just bought this router great product so far great connection for my laptop, zune, and blackberry."	1
3053	It was a really good deal.	1
3054	Came in a timely manner and looked brand new in the box.	1
3055	It was refurbished nut it was linksys certified so it seems to work great.	1
3056	Saved about $90.00 too.	1
3057	Great Value for the $$$$	1
3058	I bought this router and it drops connection quite often - many many times in a day.	0
3059	Very unsatisfied.	0
3060	Returned it in one week for  a more stable DLink.	1
3061	I purchased this product to go wireless in my household.	1
3062	The PS3 set up without problem wireless.	0
3063	"The Mac Mini was a pain to get installed, but it finally  works."	0
3064	The PC is hardwired.	0
3065	"The Xbox 360 works hardwired, but I had problems installing it wireless."	1
3066	Ended up adding all wireless MAC Address and hard coding IP address into each of the wireless objects.	0
3067	Originally received version 2.	0
3068	"After much time, energy, calls  (all a waste) to tech support, etc, it was replaced by version 3."	0
3069	"No problems w/ version 3, but beware of version 2!!"	0
3070	Others have said version 2 is a problem.	0
3071	Listen to them.	0
3072	I wish I had listened....	1
3073	"This router must be the most complicated, user-unfriendly piece of junk ever made."	0
3074	"I really must wonder who put this product together, tested it and thought it would be easy to use for the average person"	1
3075	"The directions make no sense; the interface is awful; the mysterious Lela never appears, yet you get error messages telling you to check the Lela log."	0
3076	What a farce!Save yourself a lot of aggravation and stay away.	0
3077	Was not too difficult to set up but could not get anywhere near my Charter supplied DL speed of 10 Mb once the setup was complete; the best I could get was about 3.5 Mb.	0
3078	I switched back to my 6-year old Dell router and I immediately got my 10 Mb download speed again.	0
3079	A no connection is easier to fix than a slow connection.	0
3080	"The only tech I spoke with thought I must be out of range ... but NO, both routers are only about 6 feet away from my laptop."	0
3081	I will be returning this item.	0
3082	I live in a three story house.	1
3083	The cable for my computer is on the top floor with the router and the PS3 is on the lower floor.	1
3084	I get great speeds with the router and no reception problems while playing online games....It is a great value!!!!	1
3085	We got a pretty sweet deal on our Linksys WRT160N because we bought it as an open box item from Frys.	1
3086	Weve had it for just over a year now and we couldnt be more happy with it.	1
3087	The setup was quick and straight forward.	0
3088	It has proven to be very reliable.	1

3095	This product provided a larger range of coverage than our previous router.	1
3096	It is very easy to install.	1
3097	"Im giving this product 3 stars, mainly because I purchased it refurbished for $30 and its good enough with dd-wrt firmware on it."	1
3098	"Even then, there were some random and odd issues which were only solved after doing a hard reset."	0
3099	"For the price I paid, and if the person would be willing to flash dd-wrt on it, I would definitely recommend this."	1
3100	Using default firmware or paying anything higher than $40 for it?	0
3101	Theres better options.	1
3102	"Got this for my girlfriend, have it setup on one end of the house, entire house has good signal (1 level home)."	1
3103	Never had an issue.	0
3104	This product worked perfectly.	1
3105	"Nothing to complain about in terms of connectivity, setup, or quality"	0
3106	My current situation changed which required me to return the product despite its functional capabilities	0
3107	"Linksys / Cisco are one of the top brands in the router business, and this product doesnt disappoint (if its not defective, of course)."	1
3108	CISCO downed their own routerWRT160N!V1 - 32mbV1.1 - 16mbV2 - 8mbThat means the newer version is worse than older.	0
3109	DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET A DIFFERENT ROUTER.	1
3110	I have had two of these routers for different homes with different usage and I love them in both places!	1
3111	"One house uses it for usual email and cell phones, laptops, bluray players, tablets, etc."	0
3112	"and the other house uses it for games, laptops, smartphones, etc."	1
3113	This is a great router for any household that is of average size for the average devices.	1
3114	If you have a bigger group of people or need it for heavy gaming you may have to go elsewhere for your wifi needs.	0
3115	My brother in law uses this for online gaming with PS3 and has no problem with himself on the PS3 and his PC computer online simultaneously	0
3116	Overall a great router that I have bought twice!	1
3117	I bought one of these three years ago for myself after struggling unsuccessfully with the more expensive Apple router.	0
3118	I sent the Apple one back and bought this Cisco router and girded myself to do battle with it.	0
3119	"I set aside an entire afternoon, fearing that installing it would subject me to brain damage similar to the Apple."	0
3120	But... it took less than 5 minutes.	0
3121	The installation disk directed me every step of the way and the thing basically installed itself.	0

3123	Ive given my neighbor the password to share it with him.	0
3124	Neither one of us can tell when the other is using it	0

3127	It has supported three laptops simultaneously without a hick-up	1
3128	Im going to take yet another to my sisters house as a Christmas present.	0
3129	This router is unbelievable.	0
3130	This router has caused me much grief over the past year and half I owned it.	0
3131	The DNS issue that everyone complains about is 100true.	0
3132	I constantly got redirected to wrong websites and Facebook would not open or stay open without issues all related to DNS.	0
3133	Just google WRT 160N DNS problems and youll see for yourself.	0
3134	DO not waste your money on this.	0
3135	Cisco never acknowledged this issue and never put out a fix for it and I doubt they ever will.	0
3136	I recently switched to a NETGEAR and am loving being able to surf the web without constantly doing a DNS flush and router reboot.	0
3137	"Again I can not stress this enough, CISCO DOES NOT SUPPORT this DNS issue, youll be sorry if you buy this router!"	0
3138	I purchased this router man over 4 years ago and its still working like a champ; I get signals in most parts of my 1800 apartment and the walls are concrete so I know in a wood frame structure this product should work like a champ.	1
3139	The Linksys router has been performing flawlessly for me for over a year.	1
3140	The set up was simple and is very compatible with my Mac.	1
3141	I dont even know I have it.	0
3142	That is proof enough that it works great.	1
3143	"I dont want to think about it, and I dont have to!"	0
3144	I would recommend to anyone.	1
3145	I have to restart my Linksys WRT160N router about once a week.	0
3146	It will sporadically drop all connections.	0
3147	Ive tried different configurations and firmware upgrades to no effect.	0
3148	"For this price, Im sure there are better, more low-maintenance routers out there."	1
3149	"I purchased this wireless router for my small apartment, of course the signal is strong in every corner."	1
3150	However I plan to use it for another 2-3 year and I believe its MIMO and wireless N features will be very useful in the future when I moved to bigger place.	0
3151	"My macbook pro is the only machine has wireless N ready, so I cannot really tell how fast this wireless N router is, but I am very happy with its easy setup and use design."	1
3152	And the security is more than enough for a home wireless router.	1
3153	"Highly recommend this router, since the Money magazine also recommend it, for such discount price from Amazon."	1
3154	"I was told by Dell that I had to upgrade my router from a G to an N. They suggested this router, as I could buy it from them, in their online shop."	0
3155	Well I found one at my Best Buy	1
3156	I took this home and attempted to install it on my system.	0
3157	It took hours of trying to get anything to seem like it was working.	0
3158	I contacted Linksys and they would not even talk to me unless I paid $4.00 a minute.	0
3159	All I wanted was for it to work!	1
3160	Finally I got it working and it did ok for a week or so.	0
3161	"When anyone else came over with their laptop, they would have to run the disk that came with the router."	1
3162	"More times than not, they were out of luck and could not use the internet here because of the router"	1
3163	"Finally, one time when we ran the disk on someones computer, it down loaded a Trend-Micro security program."	0
3164	Many websites suddenly became blocked from every computer on the system.	0
3165	I could not access Yahoo or Amazon for example	1
3166	I yanked the thing out and returned it.	0
3167	This was a factory refurb.	1
3168	Once I got it to recognize my hardware it worked fine.	1
3169	Didnt like spending hours on the phone to get it to connect.....and I am NOT computer illiterate!	0
3170	"stay away from it.. dont even flash it with dd-wrt, crappy product."	0
3171	"I got a wrt610N, real value for money"	0
3172	This Linksys was one of the easiest additions to set up.	1
3173	I had absolutely no problems with it and it has worked perfectly ever since its set up.	1
3174	Its very unobtrusive looking and is a great addition to my home office.	1
3175	The set up disc that came with the router could not be read.	0
3176	Had to call support center and it took about an hour to get the set up completed.	0
3177	receved no help in obtaining another disc.	0
3178	"I bought this after doing some homework and finding Dlink having better routers, Linksys customer service was better which would ease the install."	1
3179	i have installed routers in the past but wanted to insure no problems.	0
3180	we have an existing linksys G router which we never had a problem with but wanted to upgrade to faster service.	0
3181	"unfortunately, after spending about 4 hours collectively on the phone with linksys to try to solve the install problem we gave up on installation and returned the product."	0
3182	we are back to our old G router and have a new appreciation for it after the hassle of trying to install this new one.	0
3183	I recently purchased the Linksys WRT160N to upgrade from my old router which only supported 802.11g.	0
3184	"I have a personal laptop that is a MacBook, a work laptop that is an HP EliteBook, and a networked LG Blu-Ray player on my home network."	1
3185	"I setup the router, wired, using my Mac."	0
3186	Setup was a snap and took less than 10 minutes.	0
3187	All of the networked devices in the house easily found the router and joined the network	1
3188	I work from home and I use a VPN client to connect my Windows Vista computer to our office intranet.	1
3189	The WRT160N has no problem passing the VPN connection through the router.	0
3190	"The wireless signal has been stronger, more reliable, and faster since I installed this router."	1
3191	The additional network overhead added by the VPN doesnt seem to be much of an issue with this router as it was with my old router	0
3192	The LG Blu-Ray BD390 had no problem connecting to the WRT160N and Ive streamed several Netflix movies over the wireless network with no problem.	0
3193	I bought this router to replace an aging -- and unreliable -- Linksys Wireless-B router.	0
3194	"Out of the box, it looks spectacular and is worlds apart from the clunky rectangular-purple-box-with-adjustable-antennae look of my old router"	1
3195	"Setup was reasonably easy, although the setup/configuration program that comes with the CD-ROM terminated unexpectedly before the router was fully configured, requiring a reboot of my late 2008 Macbook Pro."	0
3196	"[...]Currently, the following devices are connected (via WEP protection because of the older IBM Thinkpad):Late 2008 MBP (wireless)IBM Thinkpad T40 (wireless)Sony PS3 (wireless)iPhone 2G and 3G (wireless)Vonage phone adapter Motorola VT1005V (wired)Everything seemed to be going well for the first several hours, until I noticed incredible differences in download speeds from minute to minute (ranging from 400-500 kbps to 6-7 mbps, courtesy of the free tools [....) that translated into some webpages loading at a crawl or not at all."	1
3197	"When I connected my computer directly to the router, these problems disappeared"	0
3198	A conversation with the nice people at Vonage -- based on an ultimately unfounded assumption that this was where the problem lay -- was fruitless	0
3199	"Ultimately, I spoke with Tech Support at Linksys."	0
3200	"After making some changes to the settings of the router that had no effect, I finally downloaded the firmware upgrade (from 3.0.0.1 to 3.0.0.2, build 3)."	0
3201	"Amazingly, this seems to have resolved the problem -- its shocking what a little decimal point of an upgrade can do and puzzling why a relatively new piece of hardware should be so buggy out of the box"	0
3202	"Overall, these are early days with this router."	0
3203	"Setup troubles aside, it looks great, is reasonably priced and I hope will be headache-free from here on out."	1
3204	I bought this because it says it was very easy to set up.	1
3205	"However, I had a very different experience."	0
3206	I followed all the steps but could not get my older laptop to communicate with the router.	0
3207	"After five hours of online help chats and phone calls with Linksys, we finally got the set up programmed to work with my laptop."	1
3208	Now if I want to add a computer to my wireless network the router will probably have to be reprogrammed and will again not accept my laptop.	0
3209	Great product easy to set up and use.	1
3210	I am a novice when it comes to these things but I really was pleased by the instructions and set up was like 10 minutes .This is the second linksys we have purchased but this one was definately superior	1
3211	I had a netgear wireless router before I went back to Linksys.	0
3212	The NetGear was un-Realiable and was big and bulky.	0
3213	"This Linksys router was super easy to set up, looks sleek, and has never drops a signal, and has great range."	1
3214	"I use it as a wired device for my Desktop computer, 2 Bluray players, and Xbox 360, and use it wireless for my laptop, Wii and PS3, and it works great."	1
3215	It was also 10 dollars cheaper the in retail stores.	1
3216	"Just open the box, pop the CD into the computer, installed the software and follow the easy step by step instructions and youre on your way to fast speed WIFI N internet access!"	1
3217	I only use this device with G adaptors.	1
3218	I bought this N router for future additions to my network.	1
3219	So I cant comment on its N capabilities	1
3220	What I dont like:The range is no better than my WRT-54GL.	1
3221	Major disappointment since this is primarily why I bought this product now	0
3222	I was not able to set up this machine as an access point.	0
3223	It seems to be only capable of the router function with the Linksys firmware	1
3224	This router is version 3 and is not compatible to be flashed with dd-wrt	0
3225	"Otherwise, it works ok as a router"	1
3226	I have this router set up as my Internet and home network DHCP server.	0
3227	A WRT54GL is plugged in to a LAN port and I have it set up as an access point using dd-wrt v23.	1
3228	This setup works with a different SSID for each machine	1
3229	I tried to set up the WRT-160N as an access point to a Dynex wired router without success after several hours of effort.	1
3230	"I set it up with no problems, and so far its doing what it is suppose to do-fast wireless internet; However that maybe due to me haveing Cable internet."	0
3231	"Anyway, I hooked up my desktop, labtop, Xbox 360, and my PS3 to it which no problems."	1
3232	"The only con, is that the software is outdated, its really cheesy-but it works fine."	1
3233	"I had a Netgear N before this, and when I watch instant Netflix movies, via my Xbox, it has the same amount of rebuffs as it."	1
3234	"Sidenote; when I scan for wi-fi networks in my area, I get seven."	1
3235	"Includes all of the standard features one would expect from a device like this, and the interface is as simple to use as any other router of this calliber."	1
3236	Im pleased with the quality considering I purchased mine refurbished for such a low price - it was a great deal!	1
3237	I love everything about this router except its reliability.	1
3238	It definitely has a commonly reported history of intermittent connection to other wireless adapters.	0
3239	Ive been using computers for over 25 years and the Linksys products such as the WRT54G are great.	0
3240	"This model however, gets my thumbs down."	0
3241	"I wont go into everything Ive tried, because it would just take too long to put here."	0
3242	My router worked fine for awhile then stopped alltogether.	1
3243	"Latest firmware 2.0.03 doenst help, either."	0
3244	Setup of the unit I bought did not go seamlessly.	0
3245	I contacted LinkSys support via their online chat system which hung up on me 3 times.	1
3246	I was so frustrated that I gave up and bought an Apple AirPort Extreme and Apple Care support package (where I got to talk to a real live person who talked me through the setup in a logical step-by-step manner	0
3247	I would avoid Linksys for this reason.	0
3248	THe support system is terrible.	0
3249	"However, if you enjoy 4 to 6 hours of frustration, by all means buy a LinkSys product and use their product support."	0
3250	Love Linksys until now.	1
3251	We upgraded for improved coverage in our house.	1
3252	Some improved coverage but now we consistently must try again to access the internet.	1
3253	Bummer to think about spending more in the hope that the next level up wont have the same problem	0
3254	Better luck to you.	1
3255	"when we moved, our old netgear wireless-G router wasnt sending a strong enough signal for the setup of the new place, so I replaced it with the Linksys Wireless N (WRT160N)."	1
3256	"Its only been a few weeks, but very happy with it."	1
3257	"Set up was as easy as any other router Ive ever used, and while Im competent technically, Im by no means an expert."	1
3258	Im pretty sure anyone can hook this up without trouble.	1
3259	"And the signal definitely reaches farther and through more walls than the G.  Its wired to our Dell PC, and the wireless connected to the iMac and my IBM laptop without problem."	0
3260	"I just bought this router today, overall it it very nice."	1
3261	"It was very easy to set-up, basically just plug and play."	1
3262	The only draw back is the signal downstairs is quite lacking from my old Bilken.	0
3263	I am already looking for a repeater.	1
3264	I am currently in the fourth day of trying to set up this system.	1
3265	Spent 7 hours on it myself and have had two visits by the tech.	0
3266	Will need a third visit.	0
3267	There is always some computer that cant find a certificate.	0
3268	Albeit I am hooking up to a cable company and have household computers of various vintages and languages.	1
3269	"Still, I imagine our household is a lot like the typical American household in these respects and I have successfully set up the household system twice before."	1
3270	I would not buy from Linksys again and am considering returning this one and starting over.	0
3271	the  router  arrived  quickly  and  it  works  great!!!	1
3272	I  would  recomend  this  seller.	1
3273	"Ok, I never buy a product without searching through reviews, but, I recently purchased the WRT160N based on very early reviews when Linksys was shipping version 1."	0
3274	"I have a version 1 in the office, and it works great, and has for over 1 year with linksys software."	1
3275	"Unfortunately, I was unaware of the changes in version 2, which is what I received."	0
3276	Holy cow what a nightmare!!!	0
3277	"I set it up through the admin feature (not the disc), and was going to use it so that I could use my current WRT54G (with dd-wrt software) as a bridge."	0
3278	Let me say that the hundreds of pages of write ups on forums and blogs are absolutely correct about version 2.	0
3279	It is pure crap	0
3280	I run an asterisk phone server at home and use it for my home business and our personal family lines.	1
3281	I count on my network equipment 100 222532972n order to keep the phones working around here.	0
3282	"Well, as soon as I hooked this puppy up, everything started going south."	1
3283	I was losing (wired) connection every few minutes.	0
3284	The unit could not resolve DNS 25-501520712554f the time.	0
3285	"Long story short, I spent a full weekend trying to tweak this thing into working."	0
3286	"I put in Linksys latest firmware, 2.0.03 (build 22 thousand I think) and it still fails to resolve DNS a lot of the time."	0
3287	I finally got it to work ok after setting up a static IP address (gateway and DNS servers too) instead of getting it automatically.	0
3288	"The problem is, I have a dynamic address and sooner or later, it will change"	0
3289	This thing is going back today.	0
3290	I ordered a WRT54GL from Amazon which can be flashed with dd-wrt software.	1
3291	"Its a shame that Linksys doesnt admit their mistake, replace these with something that works, and move on with life."	0
3292	"The fact that you can purchase these today, and still experience the same problems that were being discussed in Linysys own forums at least 10 months ago baffles me."	0
3293	"Unfortunately, there are very few alternatives for purchasing a consumer grade router for $[...] or less that have any decent reviews."	0
3294	Seems to be hit and miss with most brands.	0
3295	Having great hopes for a router that is able to accommodate a usb storage device was the reason to upgrade (wrt160nl).	1
3296	"I find it works well with thumb drives, but my 750 gb Western Digital, no go."	1
3297	It would have been nice to wirelessly access this storage location.	1
3298	Everything else seems to be up to standard.	1
3299	Price was fair and installation went without a hitch.	1
3300	Quality of the device seems solid and well thought out.	1
3301	Range is great...300 feet line of sight!	1
3302	"In spite of the full use potential failure, I would still recommend this product."	0
3303	"Bought this router for use with my Toshiba laptop, installed with installation disc, immediately after install my computer blue screened and shut down."	0
3304	"After repeated trys and no luck, contacted Linksys support, after 2 hours on phone with technician computer still blue screened and would not work as long as the LInksys router was plugged in, turned off router and computer worked just fine."	1
3305	"Went and bought a Netgear router, installed and computer works perfectly wireless."	1
3306	Before you buy this router be sure it is compatible with your computer(s).	0
3307	"Linksys support was also very poor, was promised a call back and never received."	0
3308	Will not buy Linksys products in future.	0
3309	"I bought this router one month ago, and now I decide to trash it."	0
3310	* This router is cumbersome to set up and adjust (too many fancy but useless features).	0
3311	"* More importantly, its wireless internet can only produce less than 101520712554f the speed I can have from wired internet."	0
3312	"I tried countless different settings of parameters (and the technical support from Linksys), and none of them worked."	1
3313	You can check out Linksys forum then you will see how many people have suffered from the same problem	0
3314	Conclusion: I wont consider buying any Linksys product in the future.	0
3315	"The Linksys WRT160N router has consistent performance, good price, a helpful software application, and a very nice set of networking features."	1
3316	"Its lack of a USB support, is my only major concern against it"	0
3317	"Doesnt work much better than older routers, unless you have a computer with a wireless N"	1
3318	"I would recommend this Router, works fine and has all the security settings."	1
3319	Absolutely effortless.	1
3320	Easy to follow instructions.	1
3321	It was up and running in minutes.	1
3322	"To put in perspective, Im a computer and network expert so if I cant get it to work the average consumer will never succeed"	1
3323	"First, the setup is very simple to follow but it doesnt work."	1
3324	I followed the 3 steps EXACTLY as described and my PC could never connect to the router	0
3325	I was able to connect wireless so I figured Id update the firmware to be up-to-date	0
3326	I discover I have Version 1 of the router and they are up to Version 3!	0
3327	"Now, I just bought this system (9/9/09) so why is Amazon selling me a product that is so out of date?"	0
3328	"With Linksys, this is the router version so my firmware is no longer supported"	0
3329	I am NOT happy with Amazon or Linksys.	1
3330	"They are selling old, non-working products."	0
3331	"Yes, they were nice enough to discount it but Id rather buy the latest version that works for $20 more."	1
3332	Amazon doesnt tell you they are selling you old versions either.	0
3333	"First, I want to thank you for the ease of ordering, shipping and the quick delivery time."	1
3334	"However the product is to me, a little less then desired."	1
3335	The router has a habit of decreasing its speed as time goes on.	0
3336	"Oh I know network,web site and internet usage effects the up and down speed but after conducting a troublshooting procedure over a span of  60 days, I have concluded a negative result."	0
3337	I have also read of the same problem encountered by others.	0
3338	"The FIX to the problem is to shut down the router by removing the power for about 20-30 seconds,power up and like magic, it resumes to the acceptable speed"	0
3339	"I like the product,except for that problem.."	0
3340	Works Great!	1
3341	Replaced a D-Link Wireless B router.	1
3342	Setup took 5 minutes.	0
3343	Very fast when used with a Wireless-N capable wireless card.	1
3344	Admin configuration is very simple and intuitive for port forwarding and firmware upgrades.	1
3345	"the product is excelent, but the setup I had to make it all manual, the auto one just doesnt work"	1
3346	I had a WRT54G previously (for 6 years) and was losing connection with my new wireless N laptop.	0
3347	Signal was weak on the new N adapter.	0
3348	Purchased the WRT160N and all the connection problems disappeared.	0
3349	Signal strength was much better also.	1
3350	All the other G devices on my network worked fine also.	1
3351	Im very happy with the WRT160N.	1
3352	I didnt use the software that came with -- I just used the routers web page to set-up.	0
3353	I am by no means an IT expert.	1
3354	"But having owned 3 different routers and setup wireless networks with 4 different phone/cable companies in the past, this is by far the most struggles that I have faced"	0
3355	THe unit did not come with any written material.	1
3356	I can understand that as its a way to cut costs and most people dont read it anyways.	0
3357	"Well, that is until there is a problem."	0
3358	"The stock CD explained the bare bone basics and once its stuck, as it did with my install, you have to call the 800 number"	0
3359	The tech on the phone is very nice and helpful.	1
3360	"However, she tried to sell me some additional features that I did not need."	0
3361	Another shameful source of revenue***Wink Wink***  I am not a fan of those dirty tactics and was/is not too pleased with it.	0
3362	I can easily see how some people can be taken advantage of	0
3363	I am not sure why they made it so difficult to install.	0
3364	"My computer can find the rounter, but the router did not connect to the internet.....hummmmm.....she (Tech) brought me back to the DOS ages (Yeah, that was a little wierd) where we had to ping the modem."	0
3365	"Again, WHY?"	0
3366	It should be point and click!	0
3367	Isnt that what Windows is supposed to do?Performance:  A combination of 12MB speed and this N-Router = Speed.	1
3368	I am pleased with the range and performance so far.	1
3369	A quick try with Netflix showed me the power of the 2.	0
3370	I am very happy with the results	1
3371	"In short, good powerful product."	1
3372	"Installation was difficult, but technician is helpful."	0
3373	Just watch out for the sales tactic that the technicians are trained to sell.	1
3374	This has been up and down since we got it a few days ago.	0
3375	Cycling the power sometimes seems to work and sometimes it just rights itself (?).	1
3376	"I did the firmware update this morning, which was a confusing process and resulted in no wireless..."	0
3377	I then went through the setup menus and toggled some things and its working at the moment.	0
3378	"Note that other reviewers have mentioned the performance differences between v1, v2, and v3, but you dont have any control over this."	0
3379	"Mine is v2, which I gather is the worst."	0
3380	"If youre looking for an electronics project and enjoy trying to figure out why things arent working, this is the router for you!I have had similar problems with Linksys before and expect that this is my last Linksys router."	0
3381	I used to have the Wireless-G WRT54-G.	1
3382	"I could not get a connection on the first floor of my apartment, when my router was on the second."	1
3383	"Now, I get a 3 bar connection!"	0
3384	This is the best wireless router you can get for less than $100.	1
3385	I am sadly resigned to the fact that inexpensive consumer wireless routers are junk	0
3386	"Made as cheaply as possible, often out of refurbished parts, the failure rate of any wireless router that costs less than a few hundred dollars is unreasonably high."	0
3387	I got lucky with my first linksys router and it lasted five years before clunking out.	1
3388	Many people who bought the exact same model never got it to work or had theirs die in a month or two	0
3389	Fast forward five years and things are no better.	1
3390	"I have helped relatives set up similar routers from this and other brands, and every time it is a crapshoot."	1
3391	"More often than not, it seems, the router will either start wonky or become wonky pretty quickly."	0
3392	"I bought a WRT160N and after months of tinkering with settings and placement within my house, I came to the fairly obvious conclusion that it was defective, and that I had wasted perhaps eight hours of my time on it"	0
3393	"As I said, I accept the above."	0
3394	"I hope and pray every day that some smaller, more agile company will emerge that releases a reasonably inexpensive wireless router with a defect rate below 50, but Im not holding my breath"	1
3395	"What gets me with linksys is that the standard solution, return the wireless router and cross your fingers that the replacement works for more than a couple months, doesnt work."	1
3396	At least not easily.	0
3397	"Linksys customer service seems explicitly set up to delay and frustrate people, perhaps in the hopes that they eventually throw up their hands and stick with their wonky router."	0
3398	"They flat-out refuse to give cash refunds for defective products, only replacing their poorly-engineered and poorly-assembled crapbox with another poorly-engineered and poorly-assembled crapbox"	0
3399	"In the end, after hours of wasting your time with their tech support, repeating steps over and over, changing settings that could not possibly be the cause of the problems you are having, you have to pay to ship their defective product back to them and hope that they deign you worthy of receiving a replacement PoS"	0
3400	Stay away from Linksys.	0
3401	Do not gamble that the Linksys product you buy will be one of the ones that works.	1
3402	If it isnt then the enormous hassle of dealing with them far outweighs any benefit their products might potentially provide	0
3403	Oh but one bright spot: it looks cool!	1
3404	"If you are interested in a sleek, stylish, very expensive paper weight maybe this is the right choice for you."	1
3405	I tried the Linksys WRT160N.	0
3406	It didnt keep a connection - even a wired one.	0
3407	"It was intermittent, I had to reset the router all the time... We had it on a secured network..."	0
3408	"It may have kept up the wireless connection to my Wii, but we didnt waste time with it and I sent it back."	0
3409	"I guess it wasnt easy enough for me, plus I didnt hear my fiance when he told me not to get a Linksys :)"	1
3410	I am using this with the Comcast internet srvice and it rarely works.	1
3411	The service works fine with out this router.	1
3412	"I have spent hours on the phone with Cisco/Linksys support, and their solution is to unplug and replug in everything everytime I use it."	1
3413	Their support knows very little about installing the product securely.	1
3414	"Terrible product, terrible support."	0
3415	Avoid buying this.	0
3416	A great choice if you need a little extra boost behind your WiFi.	1
3417	I live in a home that usually makes it difficult for a decent signal to be received if I am not in the same room with the router.	0
3418	"That is why this particular router really made a difference, and I am proud to say that it was easy to setup too."	1
3419	"I would recommend this Router, works fine, has all the security settings"	1
3420	I havent lost any signals.	0
3421	Was pretty easy to setup.	1
3422	Worth the price	1
3423	"Router was ok, Ive notices that it drops my wireless network after my laptop has been in standby mode and wont Conner right away."	1
3424	"My desk topdoes the same thing after it has gone to sleep, also I have been able to get it to transfer in 1gbs which it says it can do."	0
3425	Great buy!	1
3426	You dont have the extra charge from your cable company.	1
3427	Worth the money!	1
3428	"Recently, i purchased V3 model after returned V2 which had a lot of problem like dropping internet connection and unble to be a configuration...when install a CD."	0
3429	"To save time and avoid a return, you should be physically checking by yourself at store without opening the plastic wrap outside."	0
3430	"Looking at the bottom, there are a series number such as CSE11 for (V2) or CSE31 (V3)."	0
3431	"My experience after to install V3 model running window Vista, there are no more dropping internet connection and work great."	1
3432	"Of course, buying at store, it would cost you more plus paying tax."	1
3433	I purchased at Frys (Bay Area) around $79.99 plus tax.	1
3434	"There are no more problems, dropping internet connection, returning item, or waiting for its arrive."	0
3435	I hope some of my tips would be useful for router hunters.	1
3436	Its a great router.	1
3437	"Very easy to set up, configure, and get running."	1
3438	"If you do get this router, youll probably have it running the same day it arrives."	1
3439	I ordered the Linksys WRT160N Ultra RangePlus Wireless-N Broadband Router with my new netbook.	1
3440	"I had never had dealings with a wireless network or routers before and ordered the router not knowing what I was buying (someone had suggested I buy Linksys brand), or how I was going to install it."	0
3441	The companion DVD stepped me through the process.	0
3442	"Although, after the first successful attempt of connecting my netbook to the network, it wouldnt connect anymore."	0
3443	"I didnt know anything about changing channels, but a teen computer guru got me going again."	0
3444	"A few days later, my modem had to be replaced due to age, and I became completely lost in trying to figure out why I once again couldnt connect to my network."	0
3445	I finally paid Linksys support $9.95 to take over my computer remotely and fix the problem	0
3446	Best ten bucks I have spent in awhile.	1
3447	No more problems since.	0
3448	This is a great product for a great price.	1
3449	We have had no problems with it.	0
3450	Easy to install considering I couldnt use the CD (no CD drive with my Acer)but Tech Support did it remotely fairly easily	1
3451	"Works in all areas of my 2 story townhouse, Patio also."	1
3452	The setup was easy.	1
3453	I can sit outside the house and still get a good wireless signal.	1
3454	in the beginning of owning it my speed increased 3 fold but now it slowed down back to what my old router was pumping out.	0
3455	pretty good for the price but if you find something better buy that instead.	1
3456	I had an old reliable wrt54G router which began to have NVRAM retention problems.	0
3457	I had to reset it frequently after power outages.	0
3458	I replaced it with a WRT110 which turned out to have less range than the 54G.	0
3459	I returned it and replaced it with a WRT160N.	0
3460	It installed and ran OK but I began to get Unable to connect to website messages from Firefox about 51520712554f the time.	0
3461	It was a bit annoying but I lived with it.	0
3462	A few days ago I noticed that there was a firmware upgrade available.	0
3463	"I used the Linksys utility to flash the new firmware and, lo and behold, it crashed the router."	0
3464	"The power LED flashed continuously, no reset response and no response to a ping."	1
3465	Linksys tech support was helpful and finally decided the unit was damaged.	0
3466	I returned it and got a Linksys WRT320n to replace it.	0
3467	The 320n seems to be a much better unit.	1
3468	BTW the 160n was a V2 version which seems to have a lot of problems.	0
3469	Excellent router for the price.	1
3470	"Easy connection and setup, and no hassles after a month of use."	0
3471	"The wireless reception could be a little better, but for the money, its one of the best routers Ive used so far."	1
3472	"Now I normally do not return products that I have purchased and have the patience to work through issues with electronics, but this time I gave up."	0
3473	My internet connection indicated that it was in working order yet I still could only access the internet intermittently.	0
3474	Each morning when I would start-up the computer I would have to use the linksys EasyLink repair connection program to even get it started.	0
3475	"My portable laptop would work fine, but my main computer kept getting the error message link is broken for every website I opened."	0
3476	I talked to linksys technical customer support twice and they helped me through the problem (their customer service was great!	1
3477	and they would put it in working order.	0
3478	"However, later the signal would drop again."	0
3479	The linksys technician even told me that if it happened again than I should return the product.	0
3480	"So, I did."	0
3481	Now I have to figure out what router to replace it with.	0
3482	Annoying!	0
3483	Just configured everything right out of the box manually with only changes made on admin password and WEP encryption.	1
3484	"Extremely slow on both wired (its unbelievable, I know) and wireless connection."	0
3485	Im returning it tomorrow and I suggest you to stay away from this model as well and get ready to short CSCO stocks down to zero to make up for all of our wasted time.	1
3486	So far so good.	1
3487	As a whole wireless routers tend to be unreliable.	0
3488	Unlike many routers it provides prominent screens to help individuals create at least a relatively secure wireless network.	1
3489	"Also, unlike my D-Link Wireless G router if there is a short power failure it wont resort to creating an insecure open wireless network."	0
3490	Cisco deserves some credit for caring about the security of their users.	0
3491	It also fairly thin and sleek.	1
3492	I bought this a month ago.	0
3493	I used it with Comcasts modem to provide a wireless network throughout my house.	1
3494	"It works , no kinks."	1
3495	"It is located on the 2nd floor of the house, and I have seemless internet in the basement!"	1
3496	"It was very easy to install, and has worked well since I bought it (1month)"	1
3497	I had hoped the router would have fixed my lack of range problems my old Linksys 2.4G was having.	0
3498	I followed the install procedure (which I know is not needed to use the router but I thought I would do it all by the book this time).	0
3499	The Linksys Assistant utility is nice and not to be picky here but I had to say I was immediately frustrated by the fact the image the use in the graphical network layout was not even a picture of this new router.	0
3500	The annoyance went on further when my iMac was (eventually) recognized as a printer..	0
3501	"But hey, I didnt buy this for the software."	0
3502	I bought it for the promise of better range and strong signal quality.	1
3503	I returned it because it failed on the latter.	0
3504	I got somewhat better range from the WRT160N but was frustrated by terrible quality with constant lost connections and its losing packets worse than my 5 year old loses Lego pieces.	0
3505	I should also add that the setup was not as plug and play as I would have liked requiring I cycle my broadband modem and having to dance back and forth between my WiFi connected machines	0
3506	In its favor the WRT160N did work well my direct line connected systems without fail	1
3507	My many thanks to Amazon for having the best price on this device and their great return process.	1
3508	I have a 2 year old windows xp based pc and comcast high speed internet service	0
3509	"After trying to use the installation disc and two hours of my time trying to configure, I finally called Linksys tech support."	0
3510	Level one tech support made my problem worse.	0
3511	Finally I was elevated to Level two support and paid [...] to let that tech(thru remote)do the set up for me.	1
3512	The first thing he did was to uninstall all of Linksys software and configured manually with the existing xp software.	0
3513	He stated that Linksys installation software isnt that great	0
3514	Router has worked great now (two days straight) and is as stable as can be	1
3515	If you have a problem with set up..save yourself some time and frustration and pay the [...] to tech support to do the set up for you.	0
3516	Takes them 10 min.	0
3517	I am extremely pleased with this router.	1
3518	"A breeze to install,and now I can go anywhere very fast."	1
3519	"I am just amazed at the difference it made, everyone should have this router."	1
3520	"I used Netgear before and a friend recommended the Linksys n, so glad I listened."	1
3521	"I thought my computer was slow, it wasnt, it was the old router."	0
3522	"Wow what a difference, get one today, you will love it."	1
3523	This is a great router for a good price	1
3524	Works well with older B adapters also.	1
3525	Linksys wireless-N Router:Very slick and easy to set up.	1
3526	Price is right at Amazon at about $65 compared to $99 elsewhere.	1
3527	I have been using  mine in a about 50 ft. radios with easy connection and good signal.	1
3528	This unit was a replacement for my D-link router which I was not very happy with.	1
3529	This is a great upgrade	1
3530	If you are buying the N Router of any brand make sure the network card in your laptop supports the N router	1
3531	or you have to change the network card too.	0
3532	Newer brands of apple laptops do support the N router only it is activated (Check the online apple store for N card and direction).	1
3533	Would have expected better from Cisco.	1
3534	Router is a piece of junk.	0
3535	"I am not an IT professional and I was able to get it installed and working quickly, however, it has been nothing but a headache since."	0
3536	751520712554f the time the PC cannot connect to the internet.	1
3537	When I hook straight to the cable modem (also Linksys) no problems at all.	0
3538	Perhaps if you are an IT networking wiz this is great equipment but if are a mere mortal just say no.	1
3539	"it was all good and simple when people can do it the manual way to setup Wireless Security, then some smart people decided to put this Wi-Fi Protected Setup hope to simplify the process, but actually caused confusion and failures to setup a Secured network"	0
3540	It took me a while to guide a beginner on the phone to do it the manual and simple way.	0
3541	I have a mac (late model Imac) and Comcast cable broadband service.	0
3542	"When we moved into our new house and wanted the office in the basement, Comcast couldnt drill into the foundation, and we didnt want to run a cable from their recommended entry point."	1
3543	So wireless was the way to go	0
3544	"This would be my first experience with a wireless router in my home office, so I did a ton of research to see which router would be adequate in terms of speed and compatibility with my mac"	1
3545	"I must say, I cannot be happier with this router"	1
3546	"Contrary to some reviews from 2008, Linksys must have upgraded their installation CD, because it worked perfectly with my mac and with Airport."	1
3547	"I made a few tweaks to some default settings, and the process was done in less than 10 minutes"	0
3548	The reliability of the router so far has been great (have had it for about 2 months).	1
3549	"When I turn on my mac (or awaken it), I have to wait about 10 seconds for it to find the router, but after that it has always been smooth sailing."	1
3550	"The router is in another room in my basement, separated by 3 walls and about about 75 feet away."	1
3551	The range has been excellent all over the house (2 levels) with my mac laptop	1
3552	"I know everyones setup can be different, but for me, this router has exceeded my expectations in every way."	0
3553	The router is excellent.	1
3554	"However, when I received it the wrong installation disk and manuals were included."	0
3555	They were for a wired router and not for the WRT160N wireless router that I purchased.	0
3556	I tried to contact Amazon but could not get anyone who could help me.	1
3557	I then went to Linksys website and could not get a copy of the manual or disk.	0
3558	I had to pay a one time $9.99 fee to linksys for help with the installation	0
3559	This also took 2 phone calls because the first tech was inexperienced and I lost patience	0
3560	After the second call the tech finished up my install and the router works fine.	1
3561	"Best router ever and im serious man this router is awesome and its got great reach in wireless strength but i dont know about wireless that much because i live in a small house but the speed is really good and it also works very good online because i have it hooked up on my xbox 360 also and i play online every day and use the internet... very good product for speed, internet, and xbox live or multiplayer gaming!"	1
3562	Easy setup.	1
3563	"Lost a connection once, but followed directions to restart the connection."	0
3564	Worked like a charm.	1
3565	Very happy.	1
3566	"I have had version 2 of this router since last November to replace its predecessor, Linksys BEFW11S4 Wireless-B Cable/DSL Router."	0
3567	"It works, but the performance has been far below average and really dont see performance boost from this upgrade to N especially for my machines, which are equipped with wireless-N. Another irritation."	1
3568	The router has to be rebooted constantly as internet access comes to a halt (slow) periodically.	0
3569	A reboot immediately brings back the normal internet access speed.	0
3570	BEFW11S4 never had issues in this regard	0
3571	"Recently tried to upgrade firmware to July build 15 as recently posted on the Linksys/Cisco download web site, and hoped to resolve those issues."	0
3572	The upgrade through router administration page failed half way through and rendered the unit useless!	0
3573	"And, this is the first time I have to deal with Linksys/Cisco tech support and customer service."	0
3574	"To make the story short, I went through two departments and they insisted you went through their repeated diagnosis sessions for a hour or so, including a gal at their customer service department putting me on hold for over fifteen minutes before I finally hanged up."	0
3575	"As of this writing, I have not yet had any satisfactory resolution for my problem"	0
3576	I hardly give a company this harsh review.	0
3577	"But, they are really a big pain in a neck to deal with if you have to call them when their product or software doesnt behave as advertised"	0
3578	"Update: after suffering through 6 tech support/customer service personnel, finally came a sensible staff, who can see from customers perspective, and make the process relatively painless and reasonable."	1
3579	Great thanks go to Sarang at Linksys tech support!	1
3580	I would give 5 stars to him!	1
3581	This product works well for me.	1
3582	"It is upstairs in a study with lots of other equipment, and there are no dead spots anywhere in my home."	0
3583	Or outside.	1
3584	Or even next door.	0
3585	"I have it paired with Linksys WUSB300N-RM Wireless N USB Adapters on notebook computers, and I get very good range with good throughput or EXCELLENT throughput (300mbs) at close range"	1
3586	"If you are comfortable with setting up equipment at all, forget their software disk."	1
3587	Throw it away.	0
3588	Connect your PC into this router via patch cable (one is included) and use a web browser to hit the default IP (192.168.1.1).	0
3589	"The user ID is blank, default password is admin."	0
3590	"Change your password, then go to town"	1
3591	"The included software is - I guess - useful for the novice, in that it walks you through (with some silly quasi-animation) exactly how to plug in a network cable to the back, which ones to plug in, which port is port 1, etc."	0
3592	I assume the novice will be happy to wait half an hour while MS .net fw3 is installed and the users machine is completely reconfigured to handle the absurdly huge footprint of their setup software	0
3593	"I swear, I almost ripped the thing off the shelf, shoved it thing back in the box with torn cables hanging from the back, and shipped it right back to hell from whence it came."	0
3594	"Then, my cooler side prevailed."	1
3595	"I remembered that Linksys has a web interface onboard, I aborted all the install junk, and googled enough details to get me started properly"	0
3596	Now that I got it set up (and this off my chest) I am very happy with the product.	1
3597	I am truly impressed with this Linksys router!We had a 5-year old Netgear G router which was fine when we had only two XP computers.	1
3598	"It seemed reliable, despite dropped connections every once in a while."	0
3599	"But when we added a new Vista computer to the network, it just wouldnt work properly."	0
3600	"Dropped connections several times a day, and had to be restarted each time."	0
3601	We also had a heck of a time getting it to recognize all the computers on the network consistently.	0
3602	"When it stayed connected we got an average speed of 9mbps down, 1.2mpbs up, which I figured wasnt too bad (based on the results at [...])."	0
3603	But the dropped connections were a big problem	0
3604	"A sales guy at a local store recommended this Linksys N router, and I admit I was skeptical."	0
3605	"After all, a routers a pretty simple device when you get down to it."	1
3606	"But, not only did it solve the problem of the dropped connections, it doubled my web speed!"	0
3607	Seriously; the test at [...] was almost 19mbps down and 1.8mbps up.	1
3608	"I honestly thought I was on the Comcast 10/1 limited broadband plan, but with the Linksys router I realized Ive got 20/2!"	0
3609	"For whatever reason, I was only getting 1/2 speed with the G router."	0
3610	Weird.	0
3611	"Probably a software thing, though I did have the latest firmware for that particular Netgear router (though it was v3 hardware, and the current is v6, so I guess there are other differences."	0
3612	"Anyway, setting up the Linksys was EASY."	1
3613	"The software is incredibly user friendly, whereas Netgear was not at all (but again, maybe theyve improved in recent years."	1
3614	"The only thing was wasnt quite clear was setting up advanced security, but I was able to figure it out."	1
3615	"Also the manual said to install the hardware first, software second, but the insert in the package said to do this software first (which is correct), so there was some confusion up front"	0
3616	"All in all, Im really pleased with this routers performance!"	1
3617	This product is nothing but trouble.	0
3618	"It is incompatible with some other Linksys wireless products such as the G wireless PCI board: desktops with this board will reboot instantly at contact with the routers signal, and they will keep trying to boot until the router is powered off"	0
3619	"Even when you run it in N only, it drops the connection and requires reset very often."	0
3620	"I gave it 1 week for trial, but the connection kept falling, so I returned it."	0
3621	Dont waste your time.	0
3622	"If you have AT&T(or even older SBC) wireless-G router, you dont need to have this one."	1
3623	"I live in an old house which is not friendly for wireless system, and I tested both of them and the result were same, even this is worse sometimes."	0
3624	Why do I pay for it!	0
3625	Thanks for Amazons return policy.	1
3626	"this router is pretty good, although i do have some connection problems occasionally."	1
3627	"this is good if 4+ wireless devices in your home, although the connection speed gets really slow if you have them on at the same time."	1
3628	For instance i have 2 laptops a ipod touch and a ps3 being used on the internet at the same time the connection slows down to about .5 mbps... and i have 12 mbps right now... so ya... On the plus side it OWNS with other wireless devices.	1
3629	"i have 6 other devices that i use (printer, storage, etc...) and they connect GREAT!"	1
3630	"so you should only buy this if you have a big house, or you have a smaller house and like to work outside."	1
3631	"try putting in a central location, on a 6 ft plus hight and away from walls for at least 10 ft"	1
3632	I would not buy this except we moved and qwest did not offer wirless router in our area yet so we had to wait... the new router quest gave us works much better than this so try to just get your router from your internet provider.	1
3633	"Briefly, bought this for my father and planned on installing it in a few minutes but ran into the dreaded error 322 which means the computer doesnt detect the router."	0
3634	checked online for solutions and what a mess that was!	0
3635	"this should be simple and from what ive seen online, more people have problems like I did than ever should."	0
3636	I have nothing but positive comments on this product.	1
3637	"Not only was I able to connect my PC with ease, my peripherals were just as easy."	1
3638	When it detects a new wireless device simply push the refresh button on the router and it will connect to the device.	1
3639	"Of course, you must supply encryption pass codes for your secure network."	1
3640	The Easylink Advisor is a priceless and extremely convenient tool that allows you to control your network from your desktop.	1
3641	I bought this product a few weeks ago.	0
3642	I enjoy with the performance that product gives us.	1
3643	It increases the accessibility and speed for downloading and browser internet at same time from multiple computers.	0
3644	It was very easy to set up but there was not much improvement over the G router.	1
3645	In addition it makes quite a bit of noise when ever there is data streaming.	0
3646	"The default configuration works with most of the devices in my house flawlessly, including two different brands of laptops, IPod touch and PS3."	1
3647	"However, I was experiencing connection problems with my old Powerbook equipped with AirPort Extreme supporting IEEE 802.11g."	0
3648	I tried different security schemes but didnt make a difference.	0
3649	I searched on-line but didnt find anything that applied to my case.	0
3650	"As a last ditch effort, I switched to a different compatibility mode -- from mixed, which is the factory default, to b and g only -- and I was able to connect."	0
3651	I didnt sense any bandwidth degradation after the mode switch on any of the other devices as they are all 802.11g based.	0
3652	"So, I am keeping this router for now but will have to retire my Powerbook or buy another router thats compatible with it when I introduce a 802.11n device in my household in the future."	1
3653	[...]Pretty easy to set up.	1
3654	Comes with some software to help get you going	0
3655	"Im NO IT guy, but i do have some experience with routers and PCs and software, having lived with 2 tech-heads for about 5 years"	0
3656	There is lots of great info and how tos on the linksys site	1
3657	You will DEFINITELY NEED some research and info if you plan on accessing the router admin page!	0
3658	"Be careful, you cannot just whip thru it!Also, you can get some nice software offthe linksys/pure network magic site.[..."	1
3659	We were very pleased with our order of a refurbished Linksys Wireless router.	1
3660	The installation was easy and the router works great!	1
3661	"I am rating this router with 2 stars, because knowing what I know now, I would not have purchased it."	0
3662	"Having said that, many people will likely find this router to be compatible with their equipment, and to have decent performance as well in their environment"	1
3663	The deal-breaker for me is that this router has EXTREMELY poor performance while streaming music from a computer to another device on the network.	0
3664	"I used to do this on an old-school 802.11B router, so I would have expected this to work no-problem on an updated N router"	0
3665	"While this took a great deal of time to track down, I find this unfortunate limitation to be quite consistent."	1
3666	We use an Airport Express to play music on our system upstairs (i-tunes streams music to the AE).	0
3667	"Additionally, we occasionally stream music from a computer to either an i-phone and ipod-touch (using SimplifyMedia)."	0
3668	Note that it is impossible to have multiple audio streams going at once using this router.	0
3669	"Additionally, nobody else can surf the internet while anything is streaming"	0
3670	"On the plus side -- I have found this router to be compatible with all of my devices, which are:* Lenovo laptop* 2 Dell laptop (one using an add-on N card, the other using built-in G)* i-phone, i-pod touch* MAC TV* Airport Express* Rocu SoundBridgeI have recently gone through three routers, trying to find one that was compatible with all the devices above."	1
3671	A Netgear router came very close -- it was compatible with everything above except the Airport Express.	1
3672	"It had MUCH better performance while streaming media -- I would recommend it, except for people who need AE compatibility."	1
3673	"Ive had this router only a short time, I upgraded from a D-Link wireless G.  So far it has performed great."	1
3674	"I get a strong signal throughout my three bedroom house, and it does not freeze up the way my D-Link used to."	1
3675	My only complaint is with the installation CD.	0
3676	"First, it assumes that you will have one computer wired to the router."	0
3677	"If you plan to be completely wireless, youll need to go ahead and wire one computer during the setup process."	0
3678	After that you can disconnect.	0
3679	This can be a problem if you are trying to set up the router on top of a seven foot entertainment center!	0
3680	"Second, after you configure the router, the CD begins installation of EasyLink."	0
3681	"This is a program that not only helps you to set up your wireless network, but also takes over management of it."	0
3682	This is a problem if you prefer to let Windows manage your wireless network.	0
3683	I ended up uninstalling the program and setting up the network again in Windows.	1
3684	This made setup take significantly longer than necessary.	0
3685	"That said, the router itself is great and I dont regret the purchase."	1
3686	"I am currently using this router only in Wireless-G mode, and so far it has been solid - easy setup through the WUI, no wireless drops, and at least as good, if not better range than my previous routers."	1
3687	I received the V3 version	0
3688	Why use a Wireless-N router only in G mode?	1
3689	1) Because all of my current peripherals are G only.	1
3690	2) I wanted something that could be used with newer generation N peripherals in the future.	0
3691	3) It cost little more than a G-only device.	0
3692	4) The WRT54G2 that I purchased to replace my WRT54G was unreliable and constantly dropped the wireless connection.	0
3693	"I needed a replacement while the G2 was being RMAd, and I didnt want a lifetime supply of G-only routers"	0
3694	The one caveat with the WRT160N is that the setup CD didnt work for me.	0
3695	"It seems to expect that your computer is connected directly to your modem, which of course was not the case for me since I was swapping an existing router."	0
3696	"Im not going to re-provision my PC and modem just so the installation CD will know where to start, so I junked the CD, reset the router, and provisioned it through the web interface with no problems."	0
3697	"The last bit was easy for me since Ive used other Linksys routers, but a CD install error is likely to send a beginner into the weeds given the lack of documentation included with the router."	0
3698	I was getting a new ISP and having problems with my Roku.	0
3699	"I thought it might be the router (my Dlink) so I went to Best Buy and since they were out of Dlinks, the salesman said this would be a good one and was on sale."	1
3700	It set up fine and worked for a few hours.	1
3701	Then it dropped out.	0
3702	"After much frustration, I reinstalled the Dlink which is working perfectly."	1
3703	Would never buy another Linksys product.	0
3704	"Unfortunately, I wasted my money on this new Linskys router."	0
3705	"I even had my computer tech come over to try and figure it out, but it is not compatible with my macs."	0
3706	I should have just given in and gone to Apple once again.	0
3707	I am stuck with it now since I bought it on here third party and cannot return it.	0
3708	My fault.	0
3709	Oh well.	1
3710	"I just moved to a bigger apartment and my present router, a linksys WRT54GX4 with SRX 400 was not enough to provide full coverage."	0
3711	"I decided to install a 2nd wireless network and since the WRT54GX4 is not available anymore, I decided to buy the WRT160N"	0
3712	"Setup of the WRT160N was easier than any other linksys router I have owned, however the range is ridiculous short for a new tech router from linksys."	0
3713	"Whereas the WRT54GX4 covers more than half of my apartment, the new WRT160N is only good for 1 1/2 bedroom"	1
3714	"Linksys products are good, but this one seems to be a downgrade to a very good product."	1
3715	"I would not recommend this product and Im purchasing a used WRT54GX4, since new ones are not available anymore."	0
3716	I purchased this router to provide strength and range in a three story home with plaster walls.	0
3717	My previous 2Wire router/modem was not up to the task.	0
3718	The WRT160N installed in a flash and had me on line in the remote corner of the lower level of my house.	1
3719	"After buying a 2 year old surplus Dell to supplement the old eMac and Mac laptop, we decided that the time had come to let them all be online at once."	0
3720	"I very much prefer Mac, and having to do the setup with Windows  on the Dell (old OS in the Mac) made me nervous."	0
3721	"The most difficult thing was updating firmware so we could be wireless with the Macs-- the Linksys site the provides the downloads does not realy help you know what to do with them (I had no idea what a .bin file was, etc, and I could not find a lot of help online."	0
3722	"Finally called tech support (yes, in India) and they were absolutely fantastic -- 30 minutes, remote access, all fixed."	1
3723	10 bucks.	0
3724	Works great so far.	1
3725	"I bought this on February 25, 2009 and it drove me nuts with the now well known DNS problem."	0
3726	Hanging for 10-30sec at a time when surfing online.	0
3727	"After wasting a bunch of time troubleshooting, and thinking Comast DNS servers were to blame, I finally found the tons of forum and review posts about this."	0
3728	The solution is to downgrade the firmware to the previous version.	0
3729	"I dont remember the details now, but its ridiculous to have to do that to a new product, and silly that Linksys wont acknowledge the problem or put out new firmware for it."	0
3730	"It looks like V3 is out now, so presumably the problem is fixed."	0
3731	"Dude, it just works."	1
3732	Its v3 and Im using the stock firmware.	0
3733	Skipped the install CD and went straight to 192.168.1.1 to configure.	0
3734	Only annoying thing about setup is having to log into my DSL service with PPPoE through the router.	0
3735	Needed to get directions from linksys	0
3736	com Support pages to get guidance on that	1
3737	"Sucker performs, too."	0
3738	Have it running both G & N. Laptop and Mac Mini using G are now loading pages noticeably faster than with our old Netgear G router.	1
3739	Im sure the wife will be even happier using N on her MacBook Pro	1
3740	"Every user will have a different wireless experience because of install location, interference, building materials, etc."	0
3741	This baby is kicking tail for me.	0
3742	"I picked Linksys because Ive generally had better luck with setup, reliability, and performance than other brands."	1
3743	"Im very happy with this choice, but use what works for you."	1
3744	1) I have an old Palm TX with 802.11b.	0
3745	"When the WRT160n router is in mixed mode, the Palm doesnt see the signal."	0
3746	It only sees the router in B only mode.	0
3747	"I chatted with tech and by downgrading the firmware from v2.0.02 build 11 to build 8, it also works in B-G mixed but still not in mixed that would allow n devices to work."	1
3748	Another G device in the house works fine.	1
3749	"Obviously a firmware issue, but who knows when or if it will be fixed.2) The setup program hangs on Windows 7."	0
3750	"I downloaded the setup program from tech and ran it as administrator and it worked fine.3) Other than these issues, seems to work fine, but the first is enough to make me return it."	1
3751	I received this router a few days ago and opened it very excitedly.	1
3752	I attempted to set it up and it wasnt successful at first.	1
3753	"However, after toying with it for a while, I got it setup and working well."	0
3754	"There are quirks, though."	0
3755	"My laptop will not recognize the 802.11n radio band, which I was immensely excited to try."	1
3756	"Although that upset me slightly, the 802.11g capability is wonderful for me."	1
3757	"Constant connection throughout my house, even outside on my patio!"	1
3758	Has never went under 4 out of 5 bars and has not dropped connection.	0
3759	Im very glad for that.	1
3760	"Gaming is such a breeze!I received Version 2 of the router, and theres not been any real hiccups with it that others complain about."	0
3761	This is a large improvement over my old Wireless G setup.	1
3762	"Overall, Im happy with this router."	1
3763	This router has solved all of my connectivity problems.	0
3764	"I bought a factory-refurbished unit, and it is absolutely perfect."	1
3765	"Assuming that the marketing is correct, and the unit is actually refurbished by Linksys, why would anyone have a problem with this?"	0
3766	"Linksys is the industry leader, and this product is yet another of which they should be proud."	1
3767	Im really happy I got this router.	1
3768	The speed is good and the range is great.	1
3769	I needed something that had better range than my Apple Airport and this worked like a charm.	1
3770	Setup is not as easy as with an Airport but it wasnt too bad.	0
3771	Although the ethernet cable they sent with it didnt seem reliable.	0
3772	I would definitely recommend purchasing your own cable.	1
3773	I would have given this a 5 star if it was a combination of router/modem.	0
3774	I had bought this to replace my old combo router/modem because my old one had frizzled out on my as far as the wireless part of it goes	0
3775	But this is just a router so I just plugged it into my old one and it works fine.	1
3776	I didnt want to go out there and buy a separate modem).	0
3777	I wish I had known that this was just a router so that I wouldnt be stuck using 2 different equipments for my internet... but oh well	0
3778	Product works great as a router.	1
3779	I havent had any problems with it as of yet.	0
3780	I used this one for about a week.	0
3781	Im network savvy and this is junk.	0
3782	"I bought this one to replace my old cheap wireless router and believed in the brand name, Cisco and some good reviews"	0
3783	The signal is weak and the connection is not reliable.	0
3784	All of my wireless connections (two laptops and one IP phone) are getting dropped at the same time several times a day at random.	0
3785	They will be reconnected in a couple of mins or if the junk is reloaded.	0
3786	Im not a heavy traffic user and my config is minimum: WEP without any other features	1
3787	Shame on Cisco	0
3788	P	1
3789	S.	0
3790	This junk doesnt have a decent feature to see some basic WiFi information such as the number of current wireless clients unless you install a seperate software.	0
3791	Dont get hooked with the brand name and many good reviews.	1
3792	"For your information, I bought this junk from Amazon about a week ago."	0
3793	This is an upgrade from the WRT54G that we used for a small office network for the past 4 years	1
3794	Noticeably better performance.	1
3795	Much less resetting required	0
3796	Also setup is much easier than D-Link	1
3797	I would definitely recommend this router.	1
3798	We needed it for a VoIP install and it was the one recommended by the VoIP company due to its QoS functionality.	1
3799	This router will slow down the connection speed to less than 500 kbps.	0
3800	The speed will return to normal once power cycle.	0
3801	"I have to power cycle the router every few days, so stay away from this product."	0
3802	There are a lot of other routers to consider.	0
3803	Worthless.	1
3804	Hours of frustration troubleshooting why the internet does not work.	0
3805	Buy the d-link instead and save yourself money and time.	0
3806	This router gets 2 stars.	1
3807	The extra star is for supporting 3rd party open source firmware which make the device much more powerful than it is out of the box	1
3808	"In a noisy rf environment such as a condo complex or apartment building, forget it."	0
3809	this is the last router you want.	0
3810	i saw a macbook pro struggle through 1 wall at about 20 feet.	0
3811	I replaced the linksys router with a DLink Dir 655 and then a Buffalo wzr hp g300h.	1
3812	Bothdid much much better with any clients thrown at them.	1
3813	"basically, the linksys/cisco device could not hear through the noise."	0
3814	During periods of heavy rain it worked much better.. because the rain was preventing as much rf interference from surrounding units	1
3815	"This will work if you dont wnat to pay much, like the brand and dont have any demands"	1
3816	Anyone who cares at all steer clear and do better for about the same money.	1
3817	My old Linksys wrt54g finally died so i was told this WAP would be a good replacement.	0
3818	i should have done some web reviews first.	0
3819	It started the moment i took it out of the box and plugged it in.	0
3820	I had to cold reset it twice before i could get in for the first time to configure it.	0
3821	It has never worked worth a hill of beans.	1
3822	"I actually got a WRT54G at a garage sale for a buck, and finally just replaced this POS."	0
3823	"Dont bother even getting this on sale, you will be sorry."	0
3824	Got this wireless router about a year ago.	0
3825	It was easy to set up and has been a great product.	1
3826	One tip I have for you:  Dont set the router on top of your computer or other electronic equipment.	1
3827	"The router works best when hung on the wall, away from electrical lines in the wall, with the screw slots under the router."	0
3828	This really helps in two story homes.	1
3829	Seems to push the signal through the upper floor better.	1
3830	I have yet to have a problem with the router.	0
3831	Highly recommended for home use.	1
3832	I bought this router to browse internet and view videos.	0
3833	Browsing internet is OK (little slow).	0
3834	"Then streaming videos is terrible, too slow."	0
3835	"Takes 15 minutes to start watching a 2 minutes video on youtube and it is still buffering!Contacted Linksys customer support and said this router was an old model and was not meant for streaming videos, just browsing internet"	1
3836	"By contrary, amazon indicates this was ideal for video streaming, games, etc, which is not true"	1
3837	"So, if you just want to browse internet, then it is fine, but forget about videos"	0
3838	I am returning it.	0
3839	"and if they didnt the biggest name in networking, Cisco, would not have purchased them"	0
3840	this router is reliable and works well.	1
3841	the design is nice too.	1
3842	This router sucked really bad with the default firmware.	0
3843	Kept loosing connection while playing xbox online.	1
3844	Upgraded to firmware to dd-wrt and now it runs like a champ!	1
3845	"Item as described, works great so far, no issues."	1
3846	"This is one of the supported devices by Comcast, and is easy to set up."	1
3847	I wasted money on this router and I hope to save others from doing so.	0
3848	The router I got was declared defective by Linksys Tech support after purchasing it only 2 days before.	0
3849	I spent more time on the phone trying to fix the router than using it.	0
3850	"Furthermore, it cost me $30 during my first phone support session because Linksys transferred me to some place called Supportrix."	1
3851	After all my phone calls to tech support they said my router was defective and I should exchange it for a new one.	0
3852	"Why they think Id want another Linksys router after I got one that was defective right out of the box, completely floors me"	0
3853	Dont buy this router.	0
3854	Get another brand.	0
3855	Dont lose your money like I did.	0
3856	"If you are familiar with Linksys products, you will have no issues setting this router up."	0
3857	"If not, the setup guide is easy to understand and wont take long to get connectivity"	0
3858	I am happy with the stability and performance while the stylistic shape is appealing.	1
3859	I am very pleased with this router than my last linksys product (which was a Wireless G!	1
3860	It was amazing how easy set up was and how it helped to provide you with a password that isnt hidden or unknown to the user.	1
3861	"Before setting up the router, I had to install the Easylink Advisor that came in the disc, restart, and start making connections with the router."	0
3862	"Connection is fast, Easylink helps to setup other wired or wireless adapters that need connection to the router, plus security is great on it!"	1
3863	This item replaced a similar item from netgear and the 11.g signal strength is DRAMATICALLY lower.	1
3864	We have a laptop about 50ft away that is getting 25ignal strength now that was getting 75	1
3865	Also a PS3 that consistenly could stream from the netgear 11.g cannot even successfully download a file using the Linksys	1
3866	I have had version 2 of this router for about 2 months now.	0
3867	"I have learned a lot about this router during that time, and I DO NOT recommend that you buy it unless you are somewhat network savvy and want to deal with a potential hassle in order to get it working"	0
3868	Heres the explanation: there are 3 versions of this router.	0
3869	"All of them have suffered from problems with the firmware provided by Linksys to run the router, such as failures to resolve DNS."	0
3870	"In the case of versions 1 and 3, there have reportedly been improvements in the firmware, their chipsets are based on Broadcom, and version 1 is supported by the 3rd party DD-WRT software program, which is supposed to solve a lot of problems for these routers"	0
3871	"Version 2, unfortunately, has the Ralink chipset, reduced RAM, has no DD-WRT solution, and as of its latest firmware build cannot resolve DNS for most users."	0
3872	The best and most common solution for V2 owners seems to be that of downgrading the firmware to build 8.	1
3873	"I have done this, and my router work fine right now, but there are concerns in the Linksys forums about security risks in this older build, so its not a perfect solution"	1
3874	What is perhaps most disconcerting about this router is the complete lack of acknowledgment and concern on the part of Linksys for the failures of the version 2 firmware.	0
3875	"There is a Linksys support forum thread that has persisted for over 6 months now, with numerous complaints from V2 router owners about the routers failures to resolve DNS."	0
3876	What does Linksys do about this?	0
3877	ALL THEY DO IS SPEND TIME CENSORING THE POSTS AND EDITING OUT COMMENTS THAT ARE CRITICAL OF LINKSYS.	0
3878	There has been virtually no response from them on this thread.	0
3879	Some of the router owners have called Linksys tech support to ask for help.	0
3880	"Sometimes the techs try to offer limited help, but most puzzling is that we are told that this is the first time theyve heard of this problem (which is not likely true at all).DD-WRT has reportedly been working on a firmware replacement for V2, but its been going slow and the DD-WRT developers have not been very forthcoming on the status of development."	0
3881	So who knows when it will happen	1
3882	"In conclusion, what would I have to say to anyone interested in this router?"	1
3883	"Make sure that its a V1, not V2 and probably not V3 either."	0
3884	You can at least get DD-WRT for V1.	0
3885	How do you determine the version?	0
3886	"First, buy it in a store, so that you can physically open the box, take out the router and look at the model number on the plating under router."	0
3887	"There is nothing on the box, wrapping or documentation that says the routers version."	0
3888	You must look at the router itself.	1
3889	"If you buy it online, find out from the seller what version it is, maybe even demand that they send you a picture of the bottom of the router so you can verify"	0
3890	"If you still get stuck with a V2, either try to exchange or return it for a refund, OR downgrade the firmware to build 8."	0
3891	"If youre like me and prefer that this router work the way it should out of the box, then stay away from it and look for something else"	1
3892	Another note: These routers also come with a network management tool called LELA (Linksys Easy Link Advisor).	0
3893	"While it has a pretty user interface, not everybody likes it, either because it simply wont work (what with all the errors that may pop up, especially if your router firmware doesnt work), or because it changes your network settings (something you wont like if you already have a network set up a particular way)."	1
3894	"You dont have to install LELA to use this router, and I would recommend not using it at all even if your router is working well, unless you want another background program taking up computer resources."	1
3895	I was having terrible problems connecting to work from home over VPN.	0
3896	My MS communicator (IM) and Outlook just wouldnt work right over VPN.	1
3897	The help desk at work blamed by bandwidth and ISP (comcast).	0
3898	This didnt make sense since everyone nearly else at work also uses comcast and has the same bandwidth	0
3899	Many folks at work were also having issues with IM and said switching to a Linksys router fixed their isses - so I took the plunge.	0
3900	It did fix my IM.	0
3901	"And, the wireless signal strength is better than before"	1
3902	"But, it didnt fix Outlook."	0
3903	Linksys and my IT help folks looked at it.	1
3904	I spent more time rebooting my computer in the past week than I could stand	0
3905	Outlook still would not work over my wireless but I could connect with no issues over my neighbors unsecured network.	0
3906	I called Comcast and they wanted to upgrade my modems software but said the thing was soooo old it had to be replaced.	1
3907	A comcast guy was at my house by later in the day and replaced my modem in less than one hour - half of that on-hold waiting for the tech guy at comcast proper to pick up the phone so they could work together	1
3908	Within minutes of the modem being set up I was happily working away over VPN using Outlook and IM and everything else.	1
3909	Its nearly as fast as being in the office.	1
3910	My connection over VPN and not over VPN is clearly faster than before - its also less prone to drop outs	1
3911	Long story short.	1
3912	Its a great router but dont expect it to fix everything.	1
3913	Make sure your modem is the most up to date both in terms of hardware and software too.	0
3914	"Basically, any piece of anything between you and your internet could gum up the works and its hard knowing where the issues is (router, modem, network card, etc."	0
3915	I cant believe the number of well trained tech people I spoke to and not one of them questioned the modem.	1
3916	All of them seemed to think since I could get to the internet not over VPN that using VPN should make no difference.	1
3917	Clearly it did - apparently older modems dont play well with VPN.	1
3918	We recently purchased a laptop and had the need to purchase a wireless router.	1
3919	My son-in-law who is the computer engineer and does computers for a living selected this item and placed it in my cart for me to purchase.	1
3920	He said it would be the best for me so I purchased it.	1
3921	It has been perfect for our needs and I hooked it up!	1
3922	"If I can do that, anyone can!"	1
3923	Last weekend we had a total of 3 laptops in the house and all were connected to the internet along with our desktop so this product is doing its job!	0
3924	"It has everything you need, it is simple to setup and works with all devices, the only major major disadvantage is its range, it seems to be very very low, even at 10 yards, in a wooden house, you might lose reception."	0
3925	"I tried everything to improve it, from changing operation frequency ranges, to other settings, nothing changes."	1
3926	Ive read all about this router having so many problems	0
3927	Then noticed some people with no problems	0
3928	"Why?Its all about which version you have-1,2 or 3.Just like me,version #3 is a perfectly running unit!Home PC(XP),PS3 and laptop(Vista) connected without any loss of signals or drop outs"	1
3929	Very easy set up without the need of the included CD	1
3930	"Versions 1 and 2 will likely give you some headaches,make sure to get version 3."	0
3931	I purchased this router so that I had wireless internet in the house for my daughters laptop.	1
3932	It worked for about 10 minutes on my PC and her laptop after installing it.	1
3933	"Over the past several weeks, I reinstalled, rebooted, changed settings that were suggested on the linksys forums, called customer service - which was horrible, etc, etc."	0
3934	"After several weeks of not being able to get online unless I disconnected the router, I returned it today."	0
3935	What a piece of junk!	0
3936	"First off, the price was right compared to local retailers I saved 30"	1
3937	"Second, I live in a three story log cabin and have spent who knows how much on trying to get wirelss to work in all the rooms in my home."	1
3938	"If you are worried about range, dont."	0
3939	This product is the easiest to install and I finally have service in all areas of my home including out on the deck which I thought was impossible.	0
3940	I would recomend this to anyone.	1
3941	This Linksys is my first attempt at a wireless router.	0
3942	"It was very easy to set up (I am not a very technical person) and has a sleek, slim design."	1
3943	I only have a one bedroom apartment but I get fast internet speed in every room on my Macbook.	1
3944	Ive only had it for about a week but I would highly recommend it based on my experience so far.	1
3945	"Performance when working normal is good, but has reconnect issues and occasional freezes that require a powercycle."	0
3946	Does *NOT* play nice with AppleTV over wireless	1
3947	So far wish I would have kept my WRT54GS.	0
3948	"Linksys just released a new firmware update (3.0.0 build 12) for v3 that seems to help a bit, but this product shouldnt have been released with buggy performance"	0
3949	"Plenty of other choices, so look for other options."	1
3950	I recently bought this router.	0
3951	It worked	1
3952	Two months ago I bought a new laptop (ASUS.	0
3953	"Although the other two laptops I own continued to work perfectly, the ASUS had problems with dropping the internet connection, sometimes as often as 4 times in 15 minutes."	0
3954	"I took a trip to another city, and the ASUS worked perfectly there, leading me to believe that the problem was compatibility between the ASUS and my existing router, a three year old NetGear."	0
3955	"I had another router on hand, a two year old d-Link, so I changed routers."	0
3956	The problem persisted: the two other laptops worked fine but the ASUS kept dropping the internet	0
3957	"After getting to the point of dumping the ASUS, I decided to try a new router."	0
3958	"I bought this one, and so far (two weeks) the problem is solved"	0
3959	The installation was easy once I realized that the installation disk was assuming I was installing the router from scratch.	1
3960	"As soon as I did a cold reboot on my cable modem, the installation proceded without a hitch"	0
3961	The only glitch I have encountered is a rare problem with the computer not hooking up to the internet when I first turn it on -- has happened twice.	0
3962	"I can fix that by re-connecting the computer to the wireless system, then it stays up"	0
3963	"I read one of the other reviews telling about problems with the V2 series of the router, but so far -- knock on wood -- mine has worked fine, even though it is a V2 series"	0
3964	"I hope the router continues to work, since it is doing fine right now."	1
3965	"I used some other wireless adapter with this router,when it was connected it works ok, but it disconnect very often."	0
3966	So I had to repair or reboot the router to get it connected again often.	0
3967	I thought it was the problem of this router.	0
3968	How I discover the often disconnection problem is not the problem of this router is:Resently I read all reviews on amazon and bought a reviewed 4 stars wireless adapter (SMC wireless USB g adapter) and now It works great.	0
3969	Now the new adapter works with this router and I never get disconnected when the WRT160N router power is on.	0
3970	So you have to choose a good wireless adapter too.	1
3971	I have used two other routers.	0
3972	This Cisco model was the easiest unit to install by far.	1
3973	The directions were clear and I had the router operating in 20 minutes.	1
3974	The set up failed possibly because Dell adds so much junk software to each machine to make it easy.	0
3975	The support folks took 6 hrs.	0
3976	to make it work but they did make it work and it has been a flawless performer since then	1
3977	Installation software  one star	0
3978	Phone Support three starsHardware/Software 5 starsId buy another one.	1
3979	I bought this router because I couldnt get the D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router by D-Link to work with my Vista/Xp network (after days of online support that lacked in expertise).	1
3980	"I gave D-link a try because I felt my 3 previous Linksys routers didnt last as long as I expected (only lasted about 2 years each), but D-link was a major mistake"	0
3981	The Linksys worked the first time after an easy setup and the new configuration program is very easy to use (and reuse).	1
3982	"With regards to range, this unit is slightly better than my previous Linksys G router (so dont believe the 3x hype)."	1
3983	"Nevertheless, Im very pleased with this unit and strongly recommend it over the D-link, especially if you are mixing Xp with Vista computers in your network."	1
3984	I purchased the WRT160N router and the LinkSys CM100 cable modem to replace my old B type LinkSys router and modem that died after 6 years of good service.	0
3985	I had no problem setting up the router and installing the software with 2 of the 3 computers and the wireless printer on my home network	0
3986	"Unfortunately, I was never able to get my Gateway 9300 Solo to connect, even though it had no problems for 6 years on the B router."	0
3987	"I called LinkSys support, and the first thing they had me do was uninstall the LELA Easy Link Advisor software and use Windows to setup the connection."	0
3988	"I liked the LELA software, with its graphic network manager interface, but it consumed a lot of memory and system resources, so I was OK with using the Windows connection"	1
3989	"When that didnt work, LinkSys offered to charge me $9.95 to dial into my computer and fix the problem, a problem I never had until I bought this brand new router."	0
3990	"First of all, how were they going to dial in to the laptop, if it couldnt connect to the Internet?"	0
3991	"Since the 9300 Solo didnt come with an Ethernet card, I would have to buy an Ethernet adapter so they could dial in and debug the problem"	0
3992	"Besides, I refused to pay $9.95 to debug a problem with a new product that should be under warranty."	0
3993	Their alternative was to walk me through the debugging steps over the phone.	0
3994	"This probably cost LinkSys way more than the $9.95 I would have paid them if they were able to dial in and fix the problem, since we worked on it for over an hour and a half before they gave up"	0
3995	"I finally got to speak to a LinkSys supervisor, and he suggested that I buy the LinkSys N type adapter, since my Solo had an old LinkSys B type adapter."	0
3996	"I figured that made sense and was worth a shot, so I purchased the LinkSys WPC300N adapter and had the same problem."	0
3997	"After another hour and half session with LinkSys support, installing the latest drivers for the adapter and trying to debug the problem over the phone, they asked me to take the computer and adapter out and try to connect to another wireless network in my neighborhood."	0
3998	"If that didnt work, they were willing to replace the adapter, since they thought it appeared to be defective"	0
3999	"I was unable to connect to any of the local hotspots in my neighborhood, so while I was at Best Buy, I decided to bite the bullet, buy an Ethernet adapter and hard wire the Solo to the router."	0
4000	This worked fine.	1
4001	"At least my Solo could connect to the outside world once again, even if it was doomed to do it via the Ethernet umbilicle cord."	0
4002	I could always go back to my B type adapter if I had to take it on the road	0
4003	"Before I returned the new WPC300N adapter to LinkSys for a replacement, I decided to test it in one of the computers that had successfully connected to the router via its internal wireless adapter."	1
4004	"I disabled the internal adapter and installed the adapter that LinkSys support thought was defective and, lo and behold, the adapter had no problem connecting to the router in the other laptop."	0
4005	"In fact, I left it in the other laptop because it ran faster than the G type internal adapter that I disabled"	0
4006	LinkSys really needs to do something about their customer support.	1
4007	"They should be paying me to help them debug their products, not the other way around."	0
4008	"At this point, I am tired of dealing with them and have invested more time and money than its worth to get my Solo connected wirelessly."	0
4009	"I suspect there is a driver compatibility or memory issue with the new router and the 10-year-old Solo, but no one at LinkSys has been able to offer any explanation or resolve the issue"	0
4010	"On the other hand, I am happy to report that the WRT160N router and CM100 cable modem are working fine with the other two computers and the wireless printer."	1
4011	"The performance is much faster than the old combo, and if youre not trying to connect a 10-year-old Solo to it, you should be able to avoid the nightmare I had with LinkSys support."	0
4012	Ive had this router for 6 months now and I find it to be very touchy and unpredictable.	0
4013	"I work with two, sometimes three laptops in my home and when I physically move one of my laptops even as little as several inches, more often than not I lose my internet connection and I need to reset the router."	0
4014	This makes absolutely no sense to me as the router is ony 3 feet away from my laptops.	0
4015	I had a Dlink and had sever issues with it.	0
4016	I have always liked Linksys even if they have limited customization issues without going to some 3rd party firmware.	0
4017	I love this router!	1
4018	at the moment I sit at least 30 feet away with a cordless phone and two cellphone in the way.	0
4019	and do not experience any issues.	0
4020	"With all products you are going to find some that have issues,  luck may not be on your side and you get a dud, just like with anything else in this world."	0
4021	If you need a solid router this is a good choice.	1
4022	Hopefully I can save you some grief with this review.	0
4023	"I only wish that I had read the 24 pages (and counting) of people who have suffered the intermittent issues I am now at Linksyss own forum: [...]When it works it flies, but I immediately starting noticing delays, and then outright outages, where I couldnt even ping the router from any of my three computers."	0
4024	"Then, magically things would return and I would have hope...and then...I paid $10 for a support call where a guy in India told me Id never have the problem again and he was right...well, for about twenty minutes after the call, and then it was back."	1
4025	So I call back and they issue a RMA.	0
4026	As Ive been waiting for the useless replacement I happened upon the Linksys forum page and was stunned to see that this issue has existed for a long time and Linksys apparently doesnt care (they have never commented on the forum despite the pleas of customers).I am disgusted at Linksys.	0
4027	"I can accept that they have problems with hardware, but their unwillingness to admit it and fix it for people who paid for their products made me feel I should post here."	0
4028	Dont trust me...just read the link above.	0
4029	If you are lucky enough to not experience those issues I think this has the potential to be a great product at a fair price.	1
4030	"If not, prepare yourself for a new kind of frustration."	0
4031	"First off, ignore the software and just connect and go to the router IP address and adjust the settings with that"	0
4032	"Set up with WEP, SSID Disbled, and Mac Address Filtering."	0
4033	Probably will upgrade from WEP in near term	1
4034	Purchased this to replace a Linksys Wireless G router.	0
4035	I intended to install this with exact same settings so existing wireless clients would not have to be modified.	0
4036	"Worked well for items that were up and running, but the MAC address table would only update those wireless clients that were actually connected."	1
4037	"I initially just input desired MAC addresses into the table, but when I saved the table, only those that had accessed the router were saved."	1
4038	So I had to actually connect all clients to router to save them to MAC table.	1
4039	That in itself slowed the process down a little.	0
4040	Overall took about 2 hours to give 9 items access	0
4041	"Items attached are:  Desktop - Windows XP  XBOX 360  Linksys Wireless N Bridge connected to Directv HD DVR  2 Laptops (1 - Vista, 1 XP)  Linksys Print Server  WII  IPOD touch  ROKU Media Streamer from Netflix, AmazonThe only problem I have had so far is that on one occasion I tried to access the router via its IP address and kept getting deadlink on the browser."	0
4042	To remedy this I had to power down the router and it then worked	1
4043	"One thing I like is the Linksys Easy Access Software that is included, but for only 1 reason."	0
4044	It provides a graphic presentation of your network with the ability to name each client - that is nice as it makes it much easier to track unnamed MAC addresses.	1
4045	The other utilities provided I dont use as they really just replace using the IP address to make changes	0
4046	I see many people complaining about this router.	0
4047	"My guess is that when they run the set up, they click through and set up the security as directed (defaults to pretty robust security) and since they lack knowldege regarding wireless networks, none of their devices can connect."	0
4048	"I am not an IT professional, but would rate myself as above average knowldege for technical stuff like this"	1
4049	"Only been up for 2 days, but so far it is working fine."	1
4050	I purchased this unit to extend the reach of my older linksys WRTG54 router.	1
4051	After 1.5 hours on tech support (very patient and friendly)the tech concluded that I should by a range extender because he could not make the unit have even half the range of the previous router.	1
4052	It does NOT do what it says it will.	1
4053	DO NOT SHUT OFF OR RESTART YOUR COMPUTER IF IT CONNECTS THOUGH THIS ROUTER	0
4054	"We bought this router to get extra range on wireless N; previously we had used an extender, but had had problems."	1
4055	"The router will not willing connect to the systems, either hardwired or wireless."	0
4056	The hardwired systems stayed off for hours while the routers software detected the MAC clone we needed.	0
4057	We have Charter Communications as our ISP).	0
4058	"If a system got shut off, it would not reconnect, period."	0
4059	"Finally, on bringing up a system recently, the router shutdown the entire network"	0
4060	The wireless connections also had connection problems; the router was using the wrong DNS and wouldnt connect to the Internet.	0
4061	"This was resolved by forcing an IP address on our network and hand feeding a DNS, but this has to be undone to take the laptops on the road."	0
4062	A real headache	0
4063	"Linksys support was generally impossible, suggesting in each hardwired case that we take the computer back to the manufacturer."	0
4064	"We had four support calls, with four separate systems"	0
4065	"For reference, we have 3 hardwired computers and a secondary  router, itself with one more computer and a printer, plus two wireless computers in separate parts of the building."	0
4066	"The signal was strong, but..."	1
4067	This unit is really nice it can be put anywhere and also like it being there is not antennas.	1
4068	It works great my Wife has used her laptop all over the house also outside with not problems with the wireless connection.	1
4069	"I ordered this router 2/2/09 and have spent about 10 hours nonconsecutively on the phone with either Linksys tech or customer support, and there the router sits working just as well unplugged as plugged in."	1
4070	The install disc wouldnt recognize my ethernet port though I was streaming audio at the time.	0
4071	Linksys wanted to charge me $10 to remotely access my computer to diagnose problems...also $10 to help set up the wireless card I bought from Linksys at the same time.	0
4072	The first month was mainly please upgrade the firmware and lets change the frequency and many other things which got the router working for between 0 and 45 minutes.	0
4073	Then it worked about 1 out of 15 attempts.	0
4074	So I returned it to Linksys not knowing I should have gotten a refund from Amazon instead and saved some time and energy.	1
4075	The replacement showed up looking used and did exactly the same thing as the original.	0
4076	This led me to believe it wasnt the router but something else.	1
4077	"I spoke to Linksys about it, asking what they thought might be the problem instead of just upgrading the firmware for the 3rd time, but again they wanted $10 to check my computer remotely and for me to upgrade the firmware again."	0
4078	"So after a month with the replacement working hard at saving 8 square inches of my desk from dust damage (and 5 more calls to tech support), I was told by customer service that they would pay the shipping to send me another replacement."	0
4079	"I said I didnt pay $85 to spend my time on the phone with them, and upon asking for a refund was told only Amazon could do it."	1
4080	The window for refund with Amazon closed while the original router was going back to Linksys	1
4081	"The wireless adapter and wired internet work great when the router works, but thats about 501520712554f the time right after a reset and about 1302103740f the time after that."	1
4082	Its been quite frustrating.	0
4083	"A tech savvy friend is supposed to come check it out, but again, I didnt spend the money to waste my and others time fooling with this thing."	0
4084	"I would only buy this from a store where I could return it easily, not online."	0
4085	And there is no manual included in the packaging.	0
4086	"Also, the LELA easylink whatever software is bugged out so dont even bother."	0
4087	"Although this is a nice router, but for me i was having to unplug and plug back in the device in order to have all my computers work and still had problems with web pages not wanting to open correctly, error messages all the time and that got old quick."	0
4088	a person should not have to call the tech support everyday to get this product to function as it was indended for its use.	1
4089	product went back to store with-in 3 weeks of owning.	0
4090	may never buy a linksys product ever again.	0
4091	Ive installed or troubleshot 3 different wireless routers since I installed the first on four years ago.	0
4092	This is by far the easiest.	1
4093	"In the past, an installer spent about half a day, perhaps up to 3 days, sorting out the problems between vendors."	0
4094	"There was the internet provider, the modem, sometimes provided by the provider, sometimes not, then, there was the router vendor and the PC card vendor."	0
4095	The blame game could get pretty intense.	0
4096	"Those early routers, sadly even those by Linksys, had limited range."	0
4097	I had to install a booster on the first one and that only communicated with the basement	1
4098	"The Linksys N router, if used with a Linksys PC card is the best way to go since it can acquire the WEP code."	1
4099	Isnt self-programming marvelous.	1
4100	This technology only works with matching router and card.	1
4101	I tried initially with a Netgear router.	1
4102	"In the old days, youd have to patiently work through the WEP code issues to assure wireless security"	1
4103	Heres the problem: it only works once.	1
4104	"A few days after installing the router, which did not cooperate well with my firewalls, I was forced to re-format my computer."	1
4105	"When I installed the router, I found that it would not self-program."	0
4106	This problem cost me 3 hours with Linksys help.	0
4107	"Now, it runs smoothly at a faster uptake speed than before: 50 .v"	1
4108	130 Mbps	0
4109	Linksys has excellent customer support.	1
4110	"So does HP, which tells you how important this is"	1
4111	There is another problem with this router.	0
4112	"It is limited to only about 50 feet through obstructions, maybe more without walls and such"	0
4113	"If this review was helpful, add your vote"	1
4114	"PSWhen I moved, I thought I would have to reconfigure the router."	1
4115	Nope!	0
4116	It worked well even with the Comcast modem	1
4117	"Dirk Willard:When I moved back to Chicago for a job, I rented a room."	0
4118	A wireless router was needed because of the way the landlord configured the modem	0
4119	"Although I am only 23 feet through 2 walls in a modular constructed house, the signal is down to about 75(strong).When I was in a well-constructed older brick home, through 3 walls, and a distance of maybe 70 feet, the signal was down in the 35-45range (weak)."	1
4120	"Based on a rough estimate, I would say that 80-90 feet would be an absolute maximum with this router."	0
4121	I got this router to replace a Linksys wireless-G router.	0
4122	The G router lacked enough range to allow printouts over wifi.	1
4123	The range of this router was terrific.	1
4124	I could connect from anywhere in the house at good speed and printing worked as well as if the wifi PC was plugged directly into a switched router.	1
4125	But there was soon trouble.	0
4126	The Vista desktop PC connected to the router through its switch kept getting dropped off my home LAN.	0
4127	I was unable to resolve this problem short of frequently resetting the switch and/or the PC.	0
4128	This problem kept happening until I returned the WRT160.Ive used Linksys hardware for over a decade and Ive never had any trouble with their products before but I needed a working wireless router so I replaced it with a D-Link DIR-625 RangeBooster Wireless Router.	0
4129	It isnt quite as snappy as the Linksys WRT160 but its range is very good.	1
4130	Ive been using the D-Link for about a month now with no more problems.	0
4131	Horrible product at least in V2 WHICH YOU WILL GET!!!	0
4132	I contacted Linksys and they walked through the guide book to tell me it is defective.	0
4133	"will have very spotty wired connections to include total lose of signal, freezeing and not so strong wired signals)."	0
4134	They only option was to send it back for an exchange of the exact same model!!	0
4135	"NO THANKS, i suggested that I would pay them the differnce to upgrade to the higher model but they refused."	0
4136	BUYER BEWARE!	0
4137	"I purchased this unit, and have had nothing but trouble with it."	0
4138	"wireless connections dropped constantly, and even the wired connections are having trouble."	0
4139	"Really, for as long as routers have been around, the setup should be clean, easy, and the connection should be solid and reliable."	1
4140	I got this router because my old one bit the dust since I got this one I have had no problems getting online I can get connection in virtually every room in my 3 bedroom house and with even greater speed than the last.	0
4141	"the start up disk made it super simple to get it up and running and setting up a password is easy as pie, I would recommend this router to anyone who wants a dependable router."	1
4142	Ive had almost no problems with this router.	0
4143	"The range is good, and it runs consistently with no problems."	1
4144	I did manual setup.	0
4145	"I did not use the automated setup, and it has only mysteriously locked up one time since I bought it last November (about 5 months ago)."	0
4146	"This router was great when it worked, but it randomly blocked access to the internet preventing some sites from loading properly."	1
4147	"Then a few minutes later, it would work again."	0
4148	"I verified that everything worked OK when the PC was directly connected to the DSL modem, which made it a router problem."	1
4149	Lynksys customer support wasnt able to help despite multiple calls.	0
4150	"So, I tried returning the first one in the hopes that it was just one defective unit."	0
4151	I received the second one and it did the exact same thing.	0
4152	"Im pretty good at troubleshooting this sort of thing, but even with technical support, we couldnt figure out how to fix the problem."	0
4153	I returned the unit and Im now searching for an alternative router.	1
4154	My old Lynksis Wireless G router is still working fine with no problems accessing the internet.	0
4155	I purchased one of these routers from a local store after ruining the power cable of my old reliable Linksys WRT-54GS.	0
4156	This router gave me nothing but problems with a very inconsistent wireless signal throughout the house on multiple devices.	0
4157	The installation CD did not work with my laptop (not compatible with Vista?).	1
4158	"I ordered a Buffalo router, flashed Tomato onto it, and happily returned this Linksys device for a refund."	1
4159	Maybe I just had a bad device or terrible luck but it failed to provide the basic functionality expected - a stable wireless connection.	0
4160	Before I bought my WRT160N I was a bit worried about the negative comments.	0
4161	But since I have used Linksys for many years - the b router from way back; and then the WRT54GS g router - none of them give me issues.	0
4162	"And since I work in the computer industry, I figure I will not have the problems that others posted here."	0
4163	"Boy, was I wrong!Install was easy - then immediately I have DNS issues - cannot resolve name such was [...] I can do nslookup and that work."	0
4164	So it is the router - luckily my laptop has a separate wireless card and wireless access so a quick search shows hundreds of users having the same problem -just search on WRT160N DNS issues and you will see what I mean.	0
4165	I copied/pasted one of the links - Linksys Forum below -[...]Bottomline is - if you have WRT160N v2 build 11 you are out of luck - you need to find the build 08 Firmware and DOWNGRADE your Linksys router	0
4166	"Like I said, my day job is Technical Specialist and I soon have it fixed - but the point being, I dont want to spend my weekend fixing a brand new router and downgrade it just because Linksys sits on its known problem (since Oct of 2008)."	0
4167	"And as far as I know, Linksys does not have a fix yet and since build 11 is the latest build, chances are if you buy this now (April 2009) you will most likely get build 11.Oh, by the way, downgrade to build 08 means you now have DNS vulnerability"	0
4168	"Everything wireless in my house is Linksys - Linksys USB adapters, Linksys internet wireless cameras - but this is surely a big disappointment!"	0
4169	"As I was reading the threads, some have said that WRT310N may be better and it has 32m RAM."	1
4170	Not sure if that is true but I include it here for your reference.	0
4171	But next time I think I will go ck out some other vendors other than Linksys.	0
4172	My advice is to steer clear of this model!	1
4173	This router was very easy to install.	1
4174	"It makes internet connection with my notebook very easy, however it has created connection problems on my desktop."	0
4175	I usually keep it disconnected and only plug it in when I use my notebook now.	0
4176	"if you use linux you will notice alot of disconnection and reconnection with this router, and the speed of this thing slows down on rainy days."	0
4177	I am very happy with this wireless router.	1
4178	"After a very sour experience with our phone/internet provider where I was billed 750$ for a month of overseas call, I finally cut the service and when with another one."	0
4179	"So, I need a new router."	1
4180	I did some research of my own and ended up buying this one	0
4181	"I have 2 PC desktops, Xbox, Wii, iPad, iPod Touch and an old Macbook."	1
4182	I live in a moderately sized 3-story townhouse with 2-car garages.	1
4183	I have tried the signal on all floors and consistently gets 5 bars.	1
4184	"Before, I have intermittent connection when I go to our master bedroom."	0
4185	I went to our deck and in front of the garage - still getting strong signals	1
4186	The set-up is fairly easy.	1
4187	You have to run a CD that came with the router to 1 computer for registering and configuration	0
4188	I am amazed how small and thin this router is.	1
4189	It also has several extra ethernet ports at the back to connect computers directly if you want to	1
4190	"This router is also running our Ooma telephone system, four years and runnng."	1
4191	"After two weeks of trouble shooting this thing due to a wired DNS issue, that Cisco still refused to acknowledge."	0
4192	I finally got it working thanks to a few very helpful people on Linksys forum by down grading the router to an older version of firmware	1
4193	Ive never had such issues with Linksys products before the Cisco take over and do not plan on purchasing any more of their equipment due to their complete denial of this issue.	0
4194	Even after talking with tech support and returning the router only to have the exact same issue with the new one shipped at my expense.	0
4195	I have used Linksys WRT54GS for years (very stable).	1
4196	I wanted to upgrade to N in order to get faster speeds via wireless for my home business.	1
4197	"Linksys has 3 models of the WRT160N (V1, V2, & V3)."	0
4198	From all tech blogs and info-sites V1 seems to be stable & V3 is the new replacement for V2.	1
4199	V2 is the one that is horrible.	0
4200	I am here to validate that.	0
4201	My speed and range tests between my original G & the new N router showed that the older WRT54GS was much more stable than the WRT160N V2.	1
4202	Apparently Linksys used a different chipset with the V2 model than with the V1/V3 models.	0
4203	The firmware 2.02.2 for the V2 version of the WRT160N was created to fill a security hole but created much greater problems.	0
4204	There is no new firmware update on Linksys website to fix the fix.	0
4205	So if you get the V2 model of this router (like I did) you are stuck unless you return it.	0
4206	The issues that I experienced are the same as everyone else.1.	0
4207	Drops Internet connection intermittently hardwired and wireless.	0
4208	Very annoying while surfing.2.	0
4209	Setting it to N speed seems to not matter.	1
4210	The router seems to do whatever it wants with the speed.	0
4211	I think it is because it is disconnecting and reconnecting on its own sporadically.3.	0
4212	RangePlus is a joke.	0
4213	The original G router had a much better range.	1
4214	There is no range and definitely no range plus with the V2 version	1
4215	I have returned this router & gone back to my original Linksys G router.	0
4216	"If you have a small business, I would stay away from the V2 model of this router."	1
4217	What am I saying?	0
4218	I advise everyone to stay away from the V2 model of this router.	1
4219	"Hopefully Linksys will have a firmware upgrade soon for the V2 model but after making them aware of the issue, I wouldnt hold my breath."	0
4220	I will see if I can find a V3 model.	0
4221	Unfortunately there is no way to tell unless you open the actual box to determine which version is actually in the box	0
4222	Update: The Linksys WRT310N Wireless-N Gigabit Router is a much better alternative than this router.	1
4223	Be sure to read my review on the Linksys WRT310N Wireless-N Gigabit Router to get the sloution to solving the heat issue of the router.	0
4224	This is a really good product.	1
4225	"It was difficult at first, but all I had to do some fiddling to get it working right for me."	0
4226	The internet flow became stable and easy to work with	1
4227	im completely in love with this router because now I can play on my PlayStation 3 wirelessly as well as surf on the internet on my iPod Touch.	1
4228	Im a computer professional with over 30 years of experience and recently one of my customers wanted one of these installed.	0
4229	They purchased it and I installed it because their previous router died	0
4230	Immediately they started having problems with dropped connections etc.	0
4231	I replaced it with a much cheaper D-link which has worked fine ever since	1
4232	Linksys provided me with a new router that is only slightly better and still drops connections regularly	0
4233	This is very surprising as their reputation from the 54G days is/was very good.	1
4234	Too bad.	0
4235	This one solved my problems with a Netgear WNDR3300 router which dropped connections and had a very short range of operation.	0
4236	No problems with this router.	0
4237	Just works......	1
4238	"It is stressfully annoying to go through the many steps of understanding, undertaking and applying new technology only to discover that the ethernet network cable supplied with the product is defective!"	0
4239	Upon inquiry I was told the company will not replace it.	0
4240	So with further expense and a time consuming trip through the deadly congestion of the mind-numbing interuption of the market I can only suffer the added cost and wretch about it in my disability.	0
4241	Am concerned more than before about the quality of the product.	0
4242	I gave this router 2 stars because of the cool looks.	1
4243	Functionality I give it a 1 star.	0
4244	We have N and G devices on our network and when running in mixed mode the signal fades in and out.	1
4245	"One moment you will have 5 bars connection, the next zero and the N devices seem to run at B speed when connected."	0
4246	"When running in N mode only, the connection is close to excellent and very speedy, but still with occasional signal strength variation"	1
4247	I have the v2 version of this router and unfortunately the firmware can not be upgraded to the working 3rd party firmware yet.	0
4248	Shame on Linksys on selling this router with faulty firmware!Note this router comes with a setup disc for Windows only.	0
4249	"Mac users, forget the disc"	0
4250	If you are running N devices only in a medium to small house I would recommend this router.	1
4251	Otherwise stay with Dlink or the WRT54G.	0
4252	I just bought this router to replace an old Linksys 802.11b router that finally gave up.	0
4253	The WRT160N install was cake (BTW I installed natively  from a MacBook-- and yes the install software was on the CD).	0
4254	Install only took about 10 minutes and I was up running.	1
4255	Wireless connections are solid.	1
4256	"Works flawlessly with a Dell Inspiron 802.11b , Ipod Touch, HP laptop, MacBook and Sony Vaio laptop all running simultaneously"	1
4257	Very satisfied.	1
4258	My G-router went south so I looked into new ones.	1
4259	I havent heard that N is firm yet but is definitely coming so I went this route.	0
4260	"In the interim prior to going wireless again, I was hooked up with network cables and enjoyed the speed it provides over wireless."	1
4261	N is about twice as fast as G and nearly wired speed so I made this purchase.	1
4262	I dont regret the move up to N.  I prefer to do my own configuration and found it fairly straightforward--nothing I didnt expect on any of the tabs.	1
4263	Im very happy with the router.	1
4264	You can run it straight N or several other varations including mixed so you dont have to change all your PCs to N NICs.	1
4265	"While its wireless it can still be used for a PC that is non-wireless, perhaps a pre-wireless laptop or an older desktop you dont want to buy a wireless NIC for but would like to connect to the Internet."	1
4266	I havent used any of Linksys support yet so I cant go there with you.	0
4267	"we had netgear for about 4 years and it died twice on us....the first time we notified customer service, they wanted to CHARGE US for their services!"	0
4268	so i decided to try and fix it myself...that went well until the next failure..this time it was for good!	0
4269	I then asked around and LINKSYS is all what friends and family had told us...so went to amazon	0
4270	com (where else :) and found not only the price to be $20 lower but it came in no time.	1
4271	"This LINKSYS is not only reliable, durable and sleek in its own design but customer service is so nice and FREE!"	1
4272	the wireless connection is awesome!	1
4273	thanks linksys and amazon!	1
4274	:) 10 stars!	1
4275	"Im not new to computers but Im not a geek, either."	0
4276	Put me in the middle.	0
4277	"Ive added peripherals, but this was the first (and hopefully, last) router"	1
4278	I purchased the router at the same time I invested in a new laptop.	0
4279	I wanted to link the Vista-loaded laptop to my XP-equipped desktop.	0
4280	"It took two hours working on my own plus another *six* with (1) ISP tech, who eventually suggested I contact (2) Dell on-line, who sent me on to (3) Linksys tech who sent me back to (4) Dell, where I phoned customer service instead of going on-line again."	0
4281	"After following a series of instructions from (4), the tech told me I needed a security code from Linksys."	1
4282	I thanked her as politely as I could and vowed to call my Dell sales rep for his thoughts.	0
4283	I also thought about boxing up all the new goodies and returning them.	0
4284	"But before doing either, I clicked a menu option (4) said not to, entered the information asked for, and voila!"	0
4285	I was connected!	1
4286	I am and expect to continue to be very happy with the way the router performs.	1
4287	But getting it to work was a nightmare.	0
4288	"I highly recommend that if you buy the router, you do it when you have time to work uninterrupted should you encounter problems similar to mine."	1
4289	Ive had good luck with Linksys in the past but Im a little disappointed in this unit.	0
4290	Ive got a bunch of wireless devices connected as well as an iMac hard wired to it.	0
4291	I was having a lot of issues with all of a sudden not being able to browse the internet.	0
4292	Id have to keep unplugging the thing to reestablish a connection.	0
4293	"Finally, I set up my iMac to connect wirelessly,  I dont think Ive had to reset it since."	0
4294	The range is very good on it and Im happy with the performance.	1
4295	But I was just very disappointed with it constantly dropping off when the iMac was hard wired.	0
4296	Im not sure Id really recommend this product without a known firmware upgrade.	1
4297	"DD-WRT is a work in progress for v2 of this unit, which is what I have."	1
4298	"Once that is complete, I suppose that could fix everything."	0
4299	After reading some of the reviews and the set up problem some people were having I decided to still give it a try.	0
4300	The end result was an infrastructure that took about 30 minutes to set up.	0
4301	I followed the instructions presented by the enclosed CD.	0
4302	"Everything came up and worked fine the first time and continues to work, after more than a month, without a hitch."	1
4303	Two PCs are hard wired and two laptops and a printer are wireless and all are working just fine.	1
4304	Follow the instructions and good luck with a great product.	1
4305	"This Wireless-N router was highly recommended for my 2-story house by the person helping me with a Laptop purchase at Best Buy, but a quick check online with my Blackberry showed me that Amazon had the same router at a much lower price."	1
4306	"My previous experience was with a Wireless-G from Motorola, and the range was always an issue, but the range on this one is everything I need, allowing me to take my laptop upstairs or outside."	1
4307	"It was also very simple to set-up, and I am very happy with the purchase."	1
4308	Already wrote one.	1
4309	"After getting the Norton settings correct so that the Xbox would work with the Media Center, there was only one more challenge."	1
4310	"Wireless worked fine, but my hard-wired connection SUCKED."	0
4311	"After about an hour with Linksys support, they said set your MTU settings to 1300 (under basic setup)."	0
4312	I set mine to 1400 to meet Xbox Live requirements and it worked like a champ.	1
4313	My hard-wired connection has been great since.	0
4314	If I had read the reviews on this thing would never have bought it.	0
4315	A few minutes set up turned into hours of frustration.	0
4316	When it finally found the internet it dropped it within minutes.	0
4317	Would never know if I was going to be connected or for how long.	0
4318	"Amazon was very, very good about sending a replacement."	1
4319	"Tried it one time, and when it didnt connect the network, placed back in package and returned."	0
4320	"This Linksys WRT160N Work Great and Fast easy to Set Up, I Recommend anybody to Buy this Router Wireless-N."	1
4321	This router was a snap to install.	0
4322	It works well every where in the house.	1
4323	"I havent seen how far my connections will go, but I connect with my laptop out on my deck without any problems and it is about 60 from the router."	0
4324	I am well satisfied with this router.	1
4325	When I tried to set the router up it kept saying problems connecting.	0
4326	Finally I decided to call techinical support & they helped me through it.	1
4327	So far it has done a great job!!	1
4328	Works OK but the range is limited.	0
4329	More than 30 feet from the Router significantly decreased the connection.	1
4330	Was difficulty to set up.	0
4331	DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!	1
4332	"The first night I lost connection 5 times, having to unplug and plug it back in."	0
4333	The next day it lost connection several times throughout the day and have taken it back to the store for another router from a different manufacturer.	0
4334	"There are whole threads on sites regarding connection issues, which I didnt find till after I bought it, and the only way to make it work is to install an older version of its firmware."	0
4335	Anything that I have to try and fix right out of the box is not worth the effort.	1
4336	Ive always used linksys routers.	0
4337	This is the first time Ive had such an awful experience	0
4338	I was happy at first.	1
4339	It was easy to set up.	1
4340	The wireless worked much better than my old wireless.	1
4341	"But then we started having intermittent connection issues, both with wired and wireless connections."	0
4342	"At first I thought it was the cable, but the connection worked perfectly when directly plugged in, and I also called the cable company to check on their end."	1
4343	"Then I worked with Linksys on the phone over five hours, with numerous operators walking me through the exact same restart instructions, till the last one finally said the router was defective"	0
4344	"I returned the router for another one, and again, it set up very well initially, but then started having connection issues after a few weeks."	0
4345	"Frustrated, weve gone back to the old router (great wired, but not great range wireless), and have not had any connection issues wired, nor wired when in range of the router."	0
4346	Im going to find another router that hopefully can give us long range wireless without losing stability.	0
4347	No more cisco/linksys for me.	0
4348	"I have had that router for about a month, and at least a couple of times a day, Ill will get a message like this in my browser looking up ...  and then an error message in the browser."	0
4349	I though at first this was just a problem with my cable provider.	0
4350	"BUT after a while it became a real frustrating experience, as it can take a couple of minutes to come back."	0
4351	A REAL pain trust me	0
4352	"Then I found out a thread, with pages and pages of people having the exact same issue as me: [...] Looks like my link got deleted by Amazon, so to find this just google the words: Linksys WRT160N dns problem and use the one from forums"	0
4353	linksysbycisco	0
4354	It seems to be happening only with the latest firmware (11) and mine was shipped with that one.	0
4355	"And it seems also that there is not real cure, and so far Linksys/Cisco have been trying to ignore the issue"	0
4356	"So..the modem, when working is fast, and the wireless works great, but that issue is a real annoyance!"	1
4357	Very easy set up of WiFi and Security	1
4358	"Set up both, plus a new wireless printer in about an hour, and that included 5 PCs"	1
4359	Bought this as the first update to my WiFi network in many years.	0
4360	"It seemed to me that a more powerful network from my neighbors house was interferring with ours, so I decided to fight back."	1
4361	It seems to have worked.	1
4362	I have never set up a wireless network before.	1
4363	The set up wizard made the process extremely easy for a novice user.	0
4364	within a matter of minutes my laptop was seamlessly connected to the router with a status of Excellent.	1
4365	"If not for the tips of previous reviewers however, I would have been very frustrated with the difficulty of getting the router to play nice with the modem."	0
4366	It turns out my DSL modem and the router had the same default IP (I understand this is a common issue) which created a conflict.	0
4367	"By going into the router settings (as outlined in other reviews) and changing the IP for the router, powering down/rebooting the modem, router and laptop the configuration sorted itself out and the modem and router have been best friends ever since"	0
4368	"Note:  DO NOT install the LELA (Linksys Easy Link Advisor), you wont need it for set up and its a memory hog when booting up your computer."	1
4369	This router gave me less coverage than the 6+ year old DLinks g router I am trying to replace.	0
4370	"My computer is less than 50 feet from the hub, without a lot in between, and this couldnt reach it."	0
4371	The Linksys WRT160N will act as both a router and a wireless access point.	0
4372	A router is a device that can connect your local network to the internet.	0
4373	"This router provides DHCP/NAT services, which means that it will assign each of your computers its own internal IP address (starting with 192.168.1.x) and act as a basic firewall between your computers and the internet."	0
4374	"It also acts as wireless access point, which will allow computers with a wireles card or built-in wireless to connect to it and to your network"	1
4375	"Linksys firmware supports the usual security features, including WPA2 AES encryption and MAC Address filtering."	1
4376	"If you have a wireless network, you should read understand and enable both features to keep others from accessing your network"	0
4377	"Although the unit has no external antennas, the range is about double of what I was getting with my older WAP54."	1
4378	"Also, the unit supports 802.11N which (as of the day I wrote this review) is the fastest Wifi available."	1
4379	"It is much faster than my old WAP54, which used 802.11G"	1
4380	The unit has a low profile and looks very good.	1
4381	This router is not worth the money!	0
4382	"the N speed is not noticeably faster on it compared to G, and i constantly have the connection speed to internet degraded over the coarse of the day."	1
4383	"I have to unplug the router in the morning, and in the evening from power to make it restart, otherwise wi-fi stops working"	1
4384	"Talk to customer service, upgraded to latest firmware, no help what is so everSave your money, get a NetGear"	1
4385	"This router is slick looking, provides great coverage and acts like its supposed to so long as you dont install the LELA software."	1
4386	I had my personal laptop and my work laptop.	1
4387	I installed LELA on my personal laptop and connectivity kept cutting in and out.	1
4388	It was extremely frustrating.	0
4389	Most of the discussions about the router recommended uninstalling it and it absolutely worked.	1
4390	My first clue was when my work laptop connected to it just fine.	1
4391	"To be clear, this is not the internal administration software for the router - which has a web interface - Im referring to the software youre supposed to install on your machine that is supposed to allow your PC to connect to the internet."	1
4392	When you open the box youll see Install Software First!	0
4393	#NAME?	0
4394	"I had a Wireless-G router that seemed to always drop the connection after a few days, requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in."	0
4395	Never had such an issue with this one	0
4396	"My new personal laptop has a wireless card that supports N (and of course A, B and G) and Windows will register 84.0 Mbps at times (though it fluctuates)."	1
4397	I have a PS3 connected to it as well - never has any issues with a dropped connection	0
4398	"While there are dual antenna models that are more expensive, for my 1bd apt this is more than adequate"	0
4399	"Great router, bad software."	0
4400	Just use the windows networking to connect and youll be fine.	1
4401	"Its one thing to configure a router to suit you needs, its quite another to have to troubleshoot a product right out of the box."	1
4402	General release products that have been out on the market as long as this one has been should not be PNP.	0
4403	Plugn Pray) I bought this to replace my Linksys WRT54GS.	0
4404	"Not that my WRT54GS was faulty, I just wanted to take advantage of the newer N technology range and bandwidth."	0
4405	Specifically to reach my HP Media Extender (great product btw) from two floors up where my office PC is at	1
4406	"Originally, this router would simply drop DNS."	0
4407	"In fact, if you havent already read other reviews, this router has tremendous DNS issues with the latest firmware from Linksys."	0
4408	The fix is to back rev to the previous firmware.	0
4409	"Once I did that, the DNS issues disappeared."	0
4410	"However, this POS runs too hot, and would still drop wireless connectivity within an hour to my laptop that was sitting less than five feet away from the router itself."	1
4411	"Afterwards, I could not re-connect to it, but I could connect to my other router which is still active"	0
4412	The bottom line in my humble opinion is that this product is not ready for prime time yet.	0
4413	Same for a lot of other brands too if you read the reviews.	0
4414	Maybe thats why they call it N Draft?	1
4415	"Unless I can find another product that lives up to its marketing propaganda, Ill stick with my WRT54GS."	0
4416	"Its been stable for years, and I never have any of these issues."	0
4417	"You cant expect to use all the poewr of the N draft range if your laptop Wireless card doent support N draft, so be wary before of purchasing"	0
4418	"I have an interference problem at home, and this router has better coverage than others Ive tried before so it was a solution in my case."	0
4419	"I had high hopes for this router, having had good success with a previous Linksys wireless router."	1
4420	Our setup is we have one desktop computer wired direct into the router and one desktop and a laptop on wireless.	0
4421	"Both the laptop and the 2nd desktop get booted off the net at random, each several times a day."	1
4422	This is very inconvenient	0
4423	I am going to try updating the firmware with either Linksys or maybe an after-market firmware.	0
4424	If that doesnt solve the problem Ill have to live with it I guess...FOLLOWUP: 3-9-09: Tried to update firmware.	0
4425	The version I have is the latest available.	0
4426	"As another reviewer noted, the DD-WRT firmware update is not avail for Version 2 of this router yet."	0
4427	I tried changing channels etc.-no luck there.	0
4428	Ive had with this thing (I just got kicked off the net again during this review) Im going to pack it back up and try to return it to Amazon.	0
4429	For now I will reinstall my old router until I get a good unit.	1
4430	this router is fine as a network access point for local assess only	1
4431	"however, it loses connection very very often to the internet and requires rebooting frequently"	0
4432	"linksys tech support is a joke, outsourced to overseas reps who read less than helpful answers from a screen (and god forbit you get transferred to the wrong department ... get ready to hold for another 20-30 mins)i have found by combing through forums for hours, that this is a common problem for this router"	0
4433	save yourself some hassle and get the wrt54g its a little slower but much more reliable	0
4434	I purchased this router a little over a month ago.	0
4435	"Since using it, it has significantly slowed the pace at which I am able to surf the internet."	0
4436	I called Linksys to try to solve tis and was on the phone with tech support for 90 minutes while he tried to solve the issue and even remotely controlled my computer to adjust the settings.	0
4437	He said my router was bad and needed to be replaced.	0
4438	He said to call customer service with my case number to have this done.	0
4439	"When I called back, there was no record of my call with the tech support and they asked me to call back in 30-90 minutes to give the computer time to upload the tech guys notes."	0
4440	I called back two hours later and was transferred between 10 different people only to find out that there still were no notes and thus they would have to start again to diagnose my problem.	0
4441	This took an entire day and it is still unresolved.	0
4442	Linksys should be ashamed of their customer service.	0
4443	It is terrible.	0
4444	I purchased this router due to my old wireless D-Link gaming router not working wirelessly anymore.	0
4445	I would have liked this to have been a bit cheaper.	1
4446	I had no trouble installing this router or setting up my network.	0
4447	My only issue was it didnt recognize my broadband internet right away.	0
4448	I had to restart the router after setup and then it recognized the internet just fine.	0
4449	It has a Wifi secure setup button on it.	1
4450	This worked pretty smooth for one of my laptops that does not have an internal wireless card.	1
4451	It uses a Linksys USB adapter.	0
4452	By pushing this setup button on the router it setup my laptop all by itself.	0
4453	"I have had no dropping of the connection, the speed is lots faster than my old G router, but then all my laptops use N cards."	1
4454	I especially love the EasyLink Advisor; it has this little map of your network and shows you whos all on it.	1
4455	All in all this is a good router; its an excellent replacement to my 5 year old D-Link router.	1
4456	"After many hours of running around the house and plugging and un all the network devices, entering security keys or pushing buttons."	0
4457	I was able to get 5 out of 8 (yup large network 4 media type and 3 computers and 1 printer) to connect to the router properly.	1
4458	"Just when I thought I was able to connect to the Internet, the router had to be power cycled and then only 2 or 3 devices would connect to the Internet."	0
4459	Left it over night but to start the day had to power cycle to use desktop and get email	0
4460	"The setup was quick, but it would seem some how not complete"	0
4461	I have been running the linksys WRT54GS for years and it has stopped working.	1
4462	"It had no trouble with the XBOX 360, 2 wrt600n or any of the computers."	0
4463	The unit is being returned.	0
4464	I will have to find another router for my Home.	0
4465	This unit is way better then a G unit.	1
4466	It was easy to set-up a home network too.	1
4467	Way faster also and you can see who is no your network and lock then out also	1
4468	Great buy.	1
4469	"Warning: many of these are defective; after hours of trying to install, turns out the firmware is defective and another process starts; this router will ruin your day and your network; it does not work; tech support is incapable of helping because it turns out the firmware does not work; does not work with DSL; Cisco likely put fake reviewers on here; protect yourself from these charlatans"	0
4470	I just bought an HP notebook with integrated pre-n wireless.	1
4471	I replaced my current router with this one.	0
4472	I was skeptical about the reception because the unit is so small and all the antennas are internal.	1
4473	Well let me tell you this unit works great.	1
4474	Im able to use my notebook anywhere on my property.	1
4475	Even our iphones (on wifi) work much better now.	1
4476	Its super easy to set up and if you want you can do some advanced settings.	1
4477	It was easy to setup a print server on it.	1
4478	I replaced a Linksys G router with this model.	1
4479	The first one I got from Amazon I spent hours trying to set-up properly before giving up and declaring it non-working.	1
4480	"Im not an IT pro, but Im reasonably competent at these things and set-up our existing wireless network, which has some complexities, and just could NOT get this to work reliably."	1
4481	"Once the replacement arrived I had it up and running in minutes, even with a manual set-up on my Mac."	0
4482	"My signal strength is increased, somewhat (wi fi signal extends farther in the house), and the speed, especially close to the router, is much, MUCH faster than with G. (Id say its doubled."	1
4483	"As long as youre somewhat versed in home networking, set-up should be easy (assuming you get a working unit) and this is a definite improvement over G. Well worth the upgrade in the end."	1
4484	Ive been a network engineer and support guy for over a decade - used many different types of wireless and network equipment from enterprise based Cisco gear on down to consumer level and home brew equipment.	1
4485	NOTE: this unit will NOT support advanced firmware such as the DD-WRT	1
4486	I live in a congested urban area where 2.4GHz wireless is a challenge.	0
4487	Ive used the classic Linksys WRT54G for years - but interference from other 2.4GHz devices in my area have made it a problem.	0
4488	I purchased the 160n to try out the new pre-n standard with my compatible laptop.	1
4489	Here is what I found	0
4490	The unit was easy to set up out of the box.	1
4491	I was able to configure my ssid and wpa2/aes settings as well as port forwarding in minutes.	1
4492	The router was up and running.	1
4493	N provided a noticeable improvement in throughput for me	1
4494	Where the unit falls apart is when you put heavy traffic through it.	0
4495	My wife and I each have wireless laptops.	1
4496	"In addition, I also have a wired network that includes a Windows workstation and three Windows servers."	0
4497	I also maintain a full time IPSec VPN connection to my office (using ISA server).	0
4498	"Recently my son moved in with his Mac, which we added to the physical network"	0
4499	I have found that the Linksys will suddenly die during periods of heavy traffic.	0
4500	"It may continue to pass traffic, but DNS queries will not pass through the router."	0
4501	"Restarting the router fixes the issue in every case - but this is a huge problem, especially if I am accessing my home network remotely"	0
4502	"There are no external antenna ports - while the signal is quite strong, I do miss not being able to use my external antennas to direct more of the signal to my work area and less out the window towards my dozens of urban neighbors"	0
4503	I will likely return to my older router and use this as a dedicated N capable AP only (I am the only one using N in the house).Im looking lustfully at the D-Link dual band (simultaneous) routers at this point - but the price is beyond my budget.	1
4504	I was able to install this router in a matter of minutes.	1
4505	"It works perfectly and I am getting an excellent wireless connection in any room, on different floors of our house."	1
4506	Ive had this product 3 months now.	0
4507	"It of course would not install correctly (new Dell with Vista, 64 bit)."	1
4508	After numerous calls got it to work but the speed would drop to 1.0 mps and stay there.	0
4509	"Linksys was no help, finally fixed and was OK for some time at normal speeds."	0
4510	"Now the problem is back, spent 3 hours with linksys tech support today, would not fix the problem unless I paid $10 and guess what, the problem is back 10 minutes after I hang up."	0
4511	Linksys would blame my system.	0
4512	Plodding along at 1.0 unless I power down the router and power up again.	0
4513	Giving up and buying something else tomorrow	0
4514	UPDATE:  I have been using a d-link router now for 3 months.	0
4515	"NEVER had a problem with it, stays at the highest speed possible."	0
4516	Im ruling out the problem being my system like Linksys told me (and charged me $10 to tell me).	0
4517	"Seems simple to me, the Linksys would always drop the 1.0 mbs, the d-link never does, it was the Linksys router."	0
4518	Stay away.	0
4519	I set it up for use with my Mac and had absolutely no problem at all.	0
4520	"Very, very easy to set up."	1
4521	Just follow the steps recommended on the CD and youll be up and running in 5 minutes.	1
4522	If you do a search on [...].	0
4523	WRT160N dns issues you will see that there are serious intermittent problems with resolving dns.	0
4524	What this means is that you will recurringly not be able to access ANY web pages.	0
4525	There is currently no fix.	0
4526	Local network (my other computer and printer) work fine.	1
4527	I see no fix yet on their site.	0
4528	I like this router.	1
4529	"Plugged it in, no problems programming it, works perfectly."	1
4530	I have no beefs with it whatsoever.	0
4531	"Signal strength was good with the wireless G linksys, now poor is the best I can get."	1
4532	Im happy with this product since its pretty easy to install & fast & nice slim body.	1
4533	"I had some problems during set up (using the provided CD), but once configured manually it worked fine, with very good signal strength"	1
4534	"Recommendation: try with the CD once, if it doesnt work, dont waste additional time, just configure it manually."	0
4535	Linksys webpage shows you the way to do it.	1
4536	I have been working with Linksys products for many years and have been a loyal fan - until now.	1
4537	"This little unit, while easy to set up and great looking, does not hold a connection for more than a hour at a time without having to be rebooted."	1
4538	"I am not just whining here, read on, please, and save yourself some grief."	0
4539	"I received this unit at the beginning of December 2008 and set it up without a hitch, complete with wireless MAC filtering, a VPN to my office, full security - everything set up great."	1
4540	Then I started having intermittent problems connecting to the internet.	0
4541	"So I downloaded the latest firmware and flashed the unit which worked great (the process), except it didnt change the intermittent connection problem."	0
4542	"I spent hours researching what problems others were seeing that sounded like my own and found references to having to change the MTU setting, so I tried changing the MTU settings, easy enough to do, but still no change"	1
4543	I called Linksys support and went through a series of troubleshooting steps that matched everything that I had already tried but these too resulted in no change in behavior so the technician told me to get an RMA and send the unit back for exchange.	1
4544	I arranged for a cross-ship on which I specified that I needed to get a V2 (version2) unit just like the one I had purchased.	1
4545	Unfortunately Linksys could not read their own forms and shipped me a V1 unit in error.	0
4546	"I called in to Linksys again and arranged to have them issue a call-tag and another RMA to take back the V1 and send a V2, (which they confirmed they had in stock)."	0
4547	"When the second replacement arrived, it too was a V1 AGAIN."	0
4548	"So I again spent the time to contact customer support and after an hour and 43 minutes on the phone, I had yet another call tag and another RMA to send back the second incorrect V1 and the promise that they would send a V2."	0
4549	"I was  up to over 8 hours of research, trying settings and time spent on the phone at this point).Finally, the refurbished V2 arrives and I spend over an hour setting the unit up and guess what - within a half hour, it dropped the connection!"	0
4550	"Keep in mind that while I was playing swap the wrong unit with Linksys for 4 weeks, I had put my trusty WRT54GS back in place and it was working fine the entire time, which rules out any other source of trouble"	0
4551	I am packing both the replacement V2 and the original V2 into the box that the replacement came in and will be sending them both back tomorrow.	0
4552	"Linksys will be getting two units back, I will be out $68 and have nothing to show for it, which is nothing compared to the 9+ hours of time and frustration, and I will still be getting the better end of the bargain."	0
4553	Linksys - this product sucks and you should be ashamed to have your name on it.	0
4554	"I was expecting some install problems after installing my old router 10 years ago, but this product went in so easily I was stunned."	0
4555	Very good documentation and a very good piece of install software	1
4556	I have been running it for a month now with a mix of wired and wireless computers (four of them) and it performs flawlessly.	1
4557	Great product.	1
4558	I also found it easy to connect my router to my desktop.	1
4559	"But when I try to use it with my laptop (Compaq Presario 2100, with Windows XP), and enter my security key, I get this message: The network password needs to be 40bits or 104bits depending on your network configuration."	0
4560	This can be entered as 5 or 13 ascii characters or 10 or 26 hexadecimal characters.	0
4561	What???	0
4562	Ive wasted a couple hours already and keep getting the same message.	0
4563	"My little wireless icon says Im connected with excellent strength, but when I try to log on to the internet explorer, it doesnt work."	1
4564	"So, not so easy after all."	1
4565	"Works as advertised, folks."	1
4566	"It isnt perfect, but what is?"	1
4567	"Im running a mixed G/B/N environment which necessarily degrades N performance, but not a lot."	1
4568	I can still stream 720p HD and outstrip the bandwidth of Comcast residential service.	1
4569	I bought this product based on the positive reviews here.	1
4570	"Like most Linksys products, the router was relatively easy to setup."	1
4571	It doesnt have any of the silly problems Ive encountered elsewhere with setting up strong encryption.	0
4572	"All of my devices including ipod touch, network printer, DirecTV HD and Xbox 360 connected easily to it."	1
4573	Also had Vonage connected directly to it	1
4574	The main problem I had with this product was it losing connection every other day despite my endlessly trying different tweaks to remedy the situation.	0
4575	Restarting the router would always fix the problem.	0
4576	"Also an extremely annoying thing was when after making any changes via the web interface, the admin would stop taking requests for several minutes."	0
4577	"Also, the Access Restrictions is buggy and I could not reliably block access for one device during a specific time range"	0
4578	Out of desperation I learned about using alternative firmware versions like DD-WRT.	0
4579	"Unfortunately, v2 is not supported since it uses the Ralink chipset."	0
4580	Found out that this version only has 8MB RAM compared to the 16MB and 32MB for earlier versions.	0
4581	This I now suspect may actually be causing the router from being overloaded and might account for some folks here being very happy with the product	0
4582	"Anyway, you can now find my router on Ebay :-) I decided to try the much more expensive wrt600N version with the DD-WRT firmware."	0
4583	Ill post a review there once I receive it	1
4584	"Note, I never tried contacting Linksys."	0
4585	Past experiences were negative.	0
4586	Ill keep this short.	0
4587	This router is unliable.	0
4588	It has a major problem staying connected via a network cable and when using wireless will also drop the ball (sparatically).	0
4589	Currently I am waiting for DD-WRT firmware to be released for v2 of this router.	0
4590	"If it doesnt come out soon, Ill be looking for another router and you can bet it will NOT be a Linksys!"	0
4591	I purchased this router from Target on 2/2/09.	0
4592	I rushed home to set it up.	1
4593	Everything was fine until I tried to set up the wireless connection.	1
4594	"I kept getting an error message, something about target blocked by invocation."	0
4595	"I called Linksys customer support and after holding for about 15 minutes, I finally spoke to the most clueless customer service representative."	0
4596	I explained my situation and she kept asking me to repeat the error message.	0
4597	She then placed me on hold again.	0
4598	"After a while, I just hung up."	0
4599	I messed around with it for about 5 minutes and it has been working every since.	0
4600	I have not had any issues with the router despite many negative reviews.	0
4601	I put it in my bedroom and then go down to the family room and low signal strength.	1
4602	We have no walls or ceiling we have a vaulted ceiling and it is right next to the door that I leave open.	1
4603	I moved it downstairs one wall about 25 feet away at the most and one wall I do get very good signal.	0
4604	Also if someone else is using a computer forget low all the time.	1
4605	The software I cant even get it working It has totally crash my computer to the point I had to redo my whole system.	0
4606	My old SMC got excellent all the time from my bedroom.	1
4607	What a joke.	0
4608	If I can find my receipt I will take it back.	0
4609	Had to call Linksys to get it setup.	0
4610	"Tech person did get me up and running but it took longer than it should of, part of which was my understanding her(offshore call center?)."	0
4611	"Not pleased with how she setup my logon on key and when I asked if we could change it, she DISCONNECTED the call."	0
4612	I also get a message evey time I logon that It can find a certificate for my home network.	0
4613	Since it will probably cost me to fix both of my issues I am living with it	0
4614	While it is an upgrade to my old Linksys wireless router it seems much slower!When times comes to upgrade I will surely look at other manufactures	0
4615	I would not recommend any of this companys products.	1
4616	I bought this router in the fall of 2009 when I bought a new computer.	0
4617	It was difficult to set up and I ended calling them and then paying them some service fee so they would help me with the set up.	0
4618	"In April of 2010, it died."	0
4619	"It was under warranty so they did replace it, BUT I HAD TO PAY THE SHIPPING COSTS TO SEND THE DEFECTIVE ITEM BACK TO THEM AND PAY AGAIN FOR HELP SETIING UP THE REPLACEMENT ROUTER!!"	0
4620	That should have been my first clue.	1
4621	Then about 2 weeks ago I thought I was having problems with my internet provider because it was taking way too long to download pages.	0
4622	"Well, my internet provider came out and hooked up a new modem and in the process, he was able to determine that the problem was not the modem-it was the router."	0
4623	So I called Lynksis.	0
4624	"First of all, you should know that you will be talking to people in India or some such place."	0
4625	They are very hard to understand and follow a script-you CANNOT have a conversation with these people.	0
4626	All they can do is ask the questions on their script and then go on depending on how you answer each question.	1
4627	It is terribly tedious.	0
4628	So the person I got told me my router needed an update and I would have to give them my credit card number and be charged $39.95 for this.	0
4629	I said okay and they connected me to some other service that took the credit card information.	0
4630	"After doing the update, I discovered that this did NOT solve the problem."	0
4631	I contacted my internet provider and they helped again and determined that the router is most likely shot.	1
4632	"I called Lynksis back-they would NOT refund my payment and kept trying to tell me that they wanted to give me $15 credit toward the purchase of a new router (which they would ship and, Im sure, charge me to do so)."	0
4633	I had a hard time making this person understand that I had no desire to purchase another Lynksys product.	0
4634	He tried to tell me that this happened because the router was old.	0
4635	Im sorry-I dont consider 2 years old.	0
4636	So the end result is that now I am running without wireless.	0
4637	I will  be buying a new router but certainly not one from this company.	0
4638	I really feel like this is a very poor way to provide customer service and borders on being a scam.	0
4639	Bought this for my parents house.	0
4640	Good range and easy to use.	1
4641	A large variety of computers with different operating systems and handheld devices connected and no problems.	0
4642	I can not speak to the speed capabilities of the router as the iternet connection it is connected to is not very fast to start with.	1
4643	This router is more than enough for simple wireless networking needs.	1
4644	When this was set up I loved the convience but it only lasted a year.	0
4645	I also paid much less than what it is sold for now.	1
4646	I cant say about revisions 1 or 3 but version 2 is pure junk.	0
4647	I have had nothing but problems from this thing.	0
4648	I have lots of wireless electronics including PCs and iPhones.	1
4649	Every morning all of my devices have lost internet connection and I have to disconnect from the router and reconnect.	0
4650	Sometimes happens in the evening too.	0
4651	Tried upgrading firmware but Cisco has stopped supporting it so the last firmware is several years old.	0
4652	You cant download 3rd party firmware like dd-wrt on v2 so thats no help.	0
4653	But you can on v1 and v3.	0
4654	I have spent countless hours trying to fine-tune this thing to no avail.	1
4655	"And since I cant justify spending $100 to buy a new router just so I dont have to reset my network connection every day, I am kind of stuck with it."	0
4656	I definitely feel like Cisco left everyone high and dry with this thing and I will seriously reconsider buying another product from them.	1
4657	First of all most people have crappy equipment and want to blame the router instead of their equipment.	0
4658	I have had this router for well over three years.	1
4659	I have had it connected at two different homes and on three different PCs.	1
4660	"I have my TV, laptop, PS3, WII, and other devices working off this device."	1
4661	I have never had one problem.	0
4662	So if you cant get this device to work look into getting better equipment for this device to run on.	1
4663	I have the version three of this device in case you were wondering.	0
4664	This wireless router lasted about a year before it started having problems.	0
4665	"Network clients lost their connection to the Internet all at once every two to four hours, though their connection to the local network appeared OK."	0
4666	Replacing the cable modem changed nothing.	0
4667	Wired connections direct to the modem worked fine.	1
4668	That puts the blame firmly on this piece of junk.	0
4669	"We could temporarily alleviate the problem by resetting the clients antennae, but overnight downloads were impossible"	0
4670	"Id hoped to cure the problem by upgrading the firmware, but that turned into an infuriating process."	0
4671	Ive worked on network appliance software projects before.	1
4672	"Its not that hard, especially for a giant like Cisco, to design router firmware that can upgrade itself over an Internet connection."	0
4673	"Instead, youre required to download the binary onto your computer and upload it to the router."	0
4674	It will then choke at 98 0x1.887e01p-975nd be permanently bricked.	0
4675	"Cisco, I am never buying a consumer product from you again."	0
4676	Ive had this V3 router for about 2 years .	0
4677	I have my wifi thermostat and home security cameras connected through it as well as using it for my laptop wireless access and as a switch to other devices.	1
4678	The range isnt that great but the biggest issue was that it would not reconnect after a power failure.	0
4679	It turns out the problem was in the wall wart.	0
4680	I replaced it with one from an old router and now it reboots fine.	1
4681	Just thought Id mention it in case anyone else had the same problems.	0
4682	"After nearly more than a year of use on a remote and sparsely visited location, the radio of the WRT160N started dropping connections, with the radio light turning off as well."	1
4683	"We flashed the firmware and reset to factory defaults several times, with no change in dropping connections."	0
4684	"According to Cisco support, the WRT160N was out of warranty, which seems extremely short."	0
4685	We had to replace the faulty WRT160N with an other router.	0
4686	After I purchased this device one day it stopped working so I call cisco customer care but they told me that we cannot fix your problem as 12 months warranty expired.	0
4687	However Its only 10 months since I purchased so seller gave me past dated warranty.	0
4688	I raised many requests & call to customer care but no reply since so better buy from Cisco to get actual warranty & support.	1
4689	"This router is unreliable and it would freeze and drops connections, and require a reboot from time to time."	0
4690	Dont buy it.	0
4691	Generally easy to set up after a few hiccups.	1
4692	Excellent wireless strength and no lost signals.	1
4693	Wish it had an auto update feature for its firmware even though there isnt currently new firmware available.	0
4694	"Supposed to be easy to install, and was."	1
4695	"And the range is excellent, making access possible in places it wasnt before."	1
4696	"This linksys Router has a nice look, The WRT160N is not just good in apperience is better in performance, I recomment this item  for house and office."	1
4697	I received the router on time.	0
4698	I did not have any problems.	0
4699	I have not use the router.	1
4700	I would order for this company again.	0
4701	I purchased my WRT160N router from Best Buy and followed the instructions to set it up.	1
4702	It worked with my Dell XPS M140 for a couple weeks although the best signal strength I got was good even within 3 feet of the router.	1
4703	It then started working intermittently and finally stopped working altogether.	0
4704	"After a number of calls to Linksys tech support and about 10 hours on the phone with someone I could barely understand and some of them accessing my laptop remotely, Linksys finally decided to swap out my router."	0
4705	I had the same problem with the new router and contacted Dell tech support and was told that there were several other instances of compatibility issues with N routers and Dell laptops.	0
4706	Neither of my 3 Dell laptops recognize the N router.	0
4707	"I called Linksys tech support to see if they would swap out my N with a G, but they refused because I didnt finish their trouble shooting routine which was nothing more than try this which didnt work ... OK, try this and so on and so on and so on ... you get the idea."	0
4708	It was everything I had tried with the first router which didnt work	1
4709	"If I could rate this router with no stars, I would."	1
4710	"If I could rate Linksys tech support with one star, I would."	0
4711	They were not much help and neither was their customer service.	0
4712	The interface is almost identical to the WRT54G.	1
4713	"The speed I was able to get topped out at 145Mbps because there are several wireless G networks nearby, so if youre buying it for the promised 300Mbps and you live near other G networks, dont bother."	0
4714	"Also, when my network activity gets heavy (i"	1
4715	torrents) the router will just disconnect.	0
4716	This happens every few minutes as long as Im not browsing.	0
4717	If Im downloading and browsing it drops more frequently.	0
4718	This is extremely annoying because these disconnects last about 30 seconds.	0
4719	I have the latest firmware and I the problem occurs from multiple computers.	0
4720	If you do a search youll find this is a common problem.	0
4721	The final nail in the coffin is the lack of DD-WRT support (the last time I checked).	0
4722	Dont waste your money.	0
4723	"If you have a fast connection and you like to use it, you will get disconnects."	1
4724	"I didnt believe it either because there were plenty of good reviews, but now Im wishing I had done more research before purchasing."	1
4725	"The wireless works ok with my laptop and gaming systems, but the direct wire internet connection where I installed on my desktop is practically useless."	0
4726	"I followed the support instructions on their web site, but the router still wanted to boot me on approx every 3rd try."	0
4727	My solution??	0
4728	I plug back into my Dynex (wire router) when needed and it works fine.	1
4729	I would not recommend this Linksys only because of the direct hookup problems.	0
4730	1.Very Good product of this pricing range.2.Easy installable3.Good range coverage4.Easy connection and good speed5.Overall a nice product in N series	1
4731	"I installed this router in a large home down in the far corner of a basement, and boy did this router have reach!"	1
4732	The wireless signal travelled farther (with strength) than any other router Ive used to date (I do house service calls).The router is very easy to install.	1
4733	"The important thing is to install it without any WEP or security, which for some strange reason, it defaults to a high level of security."	1
4734	Installing this modem with high level security is best left for professionals - most home users can get by with an open insecure network.	0
4735	"So when you install, select the option of the lowest (virtually none) security"	0
4736	"Other than that, its a small, great looking box."	1
4737	Linksys has done a nice job of making the setup nearly painless (except for defaulting to a high level of security!!!	1
4738	"This product was easy to set up, make sure you follow the directions and load the software before turning on the router though."	1
4739	"took about an hour to set up everything(software, wireless network, registrations)."	1
4740	Felt great security when i tried to attach another computer to the wireless network and the main computer came up with an alert that another computer was trying to access the network (this was new to me)...i like it very much and will probably replace my Dell router with another of these Linksys units.	1
4741	"I bought this with the Linksys Dual-Band Wireless-N USB Network Adapter, WUSB600N from Wal-Mart (sorry Amazon-couldnt wait for it to ship, wanted it now)."	0
4742	"Im not a techie by any means but I love electronics, things with bells and whistles and are shiny make me pull out my debit card."	1
4743	Im embarrassed to say I didnt know I could make my desktop wireless by simply buying a router and a network adapter.	0
4744	It became necessary once I purchased my second PC a Toshiba laptop.	1
4745	Both needed to be connected to the Internet in two separate locations of my house.	0
4746	I actually talked to the salesperson at Best Buy about what I needed because I got my laptop there and I was all set.	1
4747	Its also secure so no one can use your network without entering in your long password.	1
4748	So you can feel secure conducting financial business over your network	1
4749	"The configuration was flawless it literally took less than 30-minutes to set-up the router and the network adapter on both my Dell desktop, which is 4 years old, and my new laptop."	0
4750	Im sure it takes less time than that if your not watching TV at the same time.	1
4751	Once I finished the set-up I was able to move the desktop and put the laptop in its place and tested out the laptop in the kitchen and the signal was still strong.	1
4752	My family loves it now that we are a two computer family.	1
4753	Even better I was able to set-up our Wii to the wireless network and now we can go online with the Wii	1
4754	"Pros: Range is good for 1,500 sq."	1
4755	"ft. home, the blue lights arent so bright that they will glow in the dark when your sleeping and keep you up, set-up is simple--the CD takes everything step-by-step and theres only like 8 steps, your network is secured by a password and I dont turn my router off so Im always connected and havent experienced any dropped signals so far."	1
4756	Fingers crossed	1
4757	Cons: Its so pretty and shiny you might be tempted to keep the plastic film on it so your finger prints dont get all over it.	0
4758	I usually dont give negative reviews but this router is useless.	0
4759	As soon as I configured it the problems started.	0
4760	The unit continuously dropped connections and I dont have time to play with tech support.	1
4761	"Returned it, bought a different brand, and everything is fine"	1
4762	I would have given this product one star but the configuration software is so fantastic that I bumped it one star.	0
4763	It really is too bad it didnt work out because the unit looks great and I love the software.	1
4764	"However, the purpose of this product is to reliably connect to the internet and it fails at that."	1
4765	"Who knows, maybe next year theyll spend less budget on the software and more on the router and testing."	0
4766	I like the router and have had good performance from it.	1
4767	The upgrade from g was well worth the cost.	1
4768	OMG What a terrible product from such a highly recommended company!	1
4769	"Every salesperson, every knowledgeable friend said Linksys (Cisco) was the best."	1
4770	"If thats the case, they really dropped the ball on this model (WRT160N V2).It comes with a nice user-friendly set up CD, which I found out later was a waste of time because it didnt save my customizations; I still had to go into the massive configuration program to enter the same settings."	0
4771	LELA?	0
4772	EasyAdvisor??	0
4773	Forget it; that program worked only when it felt like it.	1
4774	"Half the time it didnt even start; when it did and I managed to make necessary changes (important ones still sent me into that massive config program), it would just hang while refreshing...but it was pretty to look at while I waited"	1
4775	I managed to get internet connectivity running for only a short while.	0
4776	"Then it became unreliable, then it went out altogether."	0
4777	So naturally everyone assumed it was one faulty product.	0
4778	"I exchanged it, got an internet connectivity on the replacement but it failed not even five minutes into using it."	0
4779	"There isnt enough space for me to list all the different things I did to troubleshoot or the settings I was told to try, and I dont even remember how many times I reset, rebooted and power cycled everything."	0
4780	I did get a stabler internet connection by using my own ideas on configuration settings but could never get file and printer sharing working on my own.	1
4781	"To sum it up, after 5 chat sessions and 3 calls to tech support, I got call Microsoft"	1
4782	The tech support was absolutely terrible.	0
4783	"One person didnt know basic networking concepts like file and printer sharing, another didnt understand hexadecimal digits, a couple of techs kept asking me the same questions over and over again, I had to ask a question repeatedly and never got an answer.... Oh yeah, the reason I had 3 calls to tech support instead of just 1 is because I was hung up on twice, and no one bothered trying to reconnect with me"	0
4784	"This has been such a terrible experience, I am returning this router and Im not even going to replace it."	0
4785	Im going back to sneaker net!	0
4786	I love and hate Amazon reviews of tech products!	1
4787	"The Devil is in the details and no one ever explores them hence bad reviews for good products, just like this one!"	0
4788	The Linksys WRT160n (Ver 2) replaces my old Linksys WRT54G ( I wrote a review in 2004 when it was new) that I sold to a friend along with an old Motorola G wireless bridge.	0
4789	This new router is a lot faster (120 MB) with a Linksys WGA600N Bridge (game adapter as its marketed) conected to my Xbox 360.	1
4790	And its wireless G performance with my dell laptop is also increased.	1
4791	Im 45 ft from the router on my G laptop (with a 12 inch thick concrete rebar wall in between) but the throughput on my new WRT160N is almost double that of my old WRT54G.	0
4792	My ISP is Caviler DSL.	0
4793	There performance is spotty at peak times but I usually get connection rates from 6-10 Mbps (download).	0
4794	"Off peak hours I can stream available HD movies over Nexflix on my Xbox 360, transfer a 5 GB file from my PC to laptop while watching a different movie on netflix, look at a movie on youtube on my Iphone connected by Wifi, and play a game of chess over the net on my PSP all without any major hiccups anywhere!."	1
4795	Thats impressive.	1
4796	Id never had been able to do tht with my old wireless router.	0
4797	I paid $17 for the router and $90 for the bridge and they were both a great investment.	1
4798	I have sev other routers in my apt complx on channels 11 and 6 and my router automatically set up my network on channel 1.	0
4799	"Its both fast and secure with WPA2 and took me all of 40 mins to set up including the router, bridge and 360."	1
4800	"My gateway computer is a dell Dimension 8300 1.3 GB RAM, Win XP home, My laptop a Dell 1535 W/3 gb ram on Vista Home."	1
4801	I dont work in the IT dept at work by Im familiar with Linksys web based setup utility.	0
4802	I tried setting up the router a second time using just that and found it pretty simple.	0
4803	Details matter.	0
4804	If someone writes a review and wants to be helpful and maybe get some help from the nice community here.	1
4805	"Throw some details in, it will be appricated by all."	0
4806	"******Update 4-19-09**********  Just to let you all know, this router that I loved, died a month ago!"	0
4807	"For what ever reason, it decided it would no longer accept IP addresses."	0
4808	"I made 4 calls to Linksys customer service, lasting an hr per call, before they decided the unit was defective."	0
4809	I sent the bad unit back and got a refurbished one about a week ago.	0
4810	Its working fine but Im leary.	1
4811	I no longer trust the router.	1
4812	the replacement unit worked on the first attempt.	0
4813	I didnt install lela this time (to save the cpu cycles as it always runs in the background.	0
4814	I will update in a few weeks to let you know how its going.	0
4815	Also posted a video on youtube.	0
4816	Good router but approach with caution.	1
4817	I have been looking for a inexpensive wireless N router.	1
4818	"Bought this one, first day I had it started having problems with it."	0
4819	"It would stay on for a little bit and the crash, I have 6 Mbps dsl and my wireless connections would only get around 1 - 3 Mbps .... in the same room ....."	0
4820	"So I loaded DD-WRT, still the same thing."	0
4821	This is about the crappiest wireless-N i have ever seen.	0
4822	I am a computer / network technician for a F-1000 company..	0
4823	I deal with a lot of computers and networks on a daily basic.	0
4824	"I am also a certified Computer, Network and Security technician (A+, Network+, Security+ (CompTIA)) and also (MCP, MCSA, MCSE)."	1
4825	I am telling you my credentials to warn you from an experts P	0
4826	V not to buy this item.	0
4827	"then again, I may have received TWO broken items...."	0
4828	Awsome Router!!!!!	1
4829	works well with all my wireless devices.	1
4830	If anyone is looking for a wireless router buy this one and no other!	1
4831	This router is easy to set up and it looks good!!	1
4832	Stelth looking	1
4833	"I read all the reviews and decided this was the best, despite the many 1 star ratings i saw."	0
4834	I reasoned this because i figured I could always install the DD-WRT third party firmware.	1
4835	"Anyway, the wireless works flawlessly, which is why I wanted it."	1
4836	"However, on my dads desktop (which is not wireless enabled and thus wired to the router)... it loses the internet."	0
4837	Dont ask me how.	0
4838	All that is requried to restore the connection is to unplug the internet and plug it back in.	0
4839	Presto.	0
4840	Works perfectly again.	1
4841	"I was going to instal the DD-WRT, but I realized i probably dont have the tech confidance to do it myself."	1
4842	"So many to choose from, what do I do?"	1
4843	"Anyway, this review is a plea for help and a statement that this really is a great product, when it is working."	1
4844	"As for me, it works fine on my laptop via the wireless connection... but the wired connection to my dads computer is flaky."	1
4845	"Tech support was great, helpful, but ultimately unable to properly diagnose and fix the problem."	0
4846	"Any ideas, any help?"	1
4847	"Ordered an apple tv through amazon and before it came I set up my wireless network with a new Linksys wrt160n router, to try and save the extra $100 over the Airport extreme."	1
4848	What a mistake!	0
4849	The linksys was an easy set up though it did not support changes made thru safari even though it claimed to on the box.	0
4850	Luckily I had firefox installed on my new imac and that worked for setup.	0
4851	Worked fine for 10 minutes then lost throughput connection.	1
4852	This happened 4 times in 2 days.	0
4853	Tech support had me buy new cables and reset to no avail.	0
4854	Finally returned it to staples and bought the airport extreme.	0
4855	5 minutes and it was up and running and it flies when dl to apple tv.	0
4856	Penny wise dollar foolish.	0
4857	I bought the WRT160N as my very first router.	0
4858	The software was very easy to install and the configuration was surprisingly simple.	1
4859	"I had a wireless network up and going (with an internet access point, printer, and a PC) in about 20 minutes."	0
4860	Everything worked great with the router in the same room with the equipment.	1
4861	"However, when I moved the router to its intended location in an adjacent room, the signal was so weak that my PC could rarely connect to it."	0
4862	Resetting the router and rebooting the PC did not help	0
4863	"Through trial and error (with the help of a laptop), I determined that the routers signal was really too weak (there was always the possibility that the network adapter in the PC could be the issue too)."	0
4864	I ended up returning the router to Amazon	0
4865	"My house was constructed in the late 1940s and the walls are plaster, but quite thick (much thicker than the dry wall that is typically used in todays construction)."	0
4866	I am thinking that this has something to do with how weak the signal was when the router was situated in the adjoining room (with no direct line of sight).There are some that suggest that I try a different router (such as the D-Link DIR-655) as I may have better success in getting a signal through the walls	1
4867	"All in all, I was pleased with the software and ease of set up, but really disappointed with the performance of this router."	1
4868	Yes it looks really cool.	1
4869	Yes setup is easy.	1
4870	Yes the WiFi range is outstanding.	1
4871	"Yes, after using this product for a few weeks the Wi-Fi system fails and requires a power cycle to restore."	0
4872	"Yep, flashed the firmware already."	0
4873	I turned to the Web for adivce and found many people that are having the same problem with this product.	0
4874	Linksys tech support has been zero help.	1
4875	Research before you buy.	0
4876	I bought this router after we added a laptop to our list of home computers.	0
4877	I am very happy with the wireless range and speed this router gave the laptop which is N-compatible.	1
4878	Unfortunately the Internet connections keep dropping.	0
4879	"It is especially frustrating on the wired connections, which also seem to be slower than the laptop (maybe b/c they are older."	0
4880	Tech support ultimately implied that the problem is with my computers but when I plugged their wires directly into the cable modem (circumventing the router) they were still quite speedy and the Internet no longer seized up.	1
4881	I am going to return this router and dont recommend it.	1
4882	"This router not only is super fast, but it is also super easy to set up."	1
4883	The only downfall was getting it set up to work with my iPhone was a little tricky.	0
4884	"However, customer support for Linksys new what the problem was and they talked me through fixing it in about 2 minutes."	0
4885	Not a big enough problem to even take a star away!	0
4886	"I took one look at the included disc and documentation, and decided to skip it."	0
4887	"I have a mixed Mac and PC environment, and it was pretty clear that the installation software wasnt for Mac."	1
4888	"Thats clearly a problem for novice Mac users, so if youre not prepared to do some manual setup, I would find a different product"	0
4889	"If you do know how to do a bit of setup, the management screens are no better or worse than my previous Linksys and Netgear routers."	0
4890	"Using my Mac and Firefox browser, out of the box, I had the router up and running, with AES encryption and MAC address authentication, in about 20 minutes"	0
4891	Ive had it since December and Im impressed with it.	1
4892	"First, Wireless-N made a big difference for wireless file transfers in my house."	0
4893	"Streaming movies from my NAS to my PC or Mac, which stuttered like crazy with my Wireless-G, is now seamless."	0
4894	"Second, wireless signal on the second floor (router is in the basement) is stronger."	1
4895	"Not sure if its psychological, but pages seem to load a bit faster too."	1
4896	"Finally, the router seems to run cooler than my old Netgear."	1
4897	"Id love to run a current test on it, to see if it really is drawing less power, but cooler is definitely a good sign"	1
4898	"All-in-all, the product is solid."	1
4899	"The packaging is nice, the Wireless-N works as advertised, and the software works well (but is only average)."	1
4900	Well see if it performs consistently for 2+ years like my Netgear.	1
4901	I take one star off for useless install software for Mac or heterogeneous users.	0
4902	How hard is it to get that right?!	0
4903	"Update:Over a year later, no firmware updates and nothing has changed from my initial review."	0
4904	"And, as with all Cisco/Linksys routers, the integrated web interface is old, needs updating and can provide more flexibility."	1
4905	The WRT-DD firmware is an example of what a large company like Cisco could do.	0
4906	"If they added half of WRT-DDs functionality, itd have 2x more functionality."	0
4907	What have I been using this for?	0
4908	"Since it was junk out of the box and I never got around to returning it, I picked up a WRT610N and installed WRT-DDs firmware on this."	0
4909	"I dont do this with all my routers (I currently have 7, 3 with guest networks and dual band so a total of 13 routed wireless networks plus 2 wired networks) because I dont want to risk flakiness/have to adjust all the time on those I depend on being up all the time."	0
4910	"However, WRTs fw has been 100table on this."	0
4911	The only time it has been restarted is power outages.	0
4912	"I made this a bridge to provide more range (though 50 4.801150e-294ss performance) for my WRT610N, which, as far as I know, was the only true dual [simultaneous] band wireless router out at the time."	1
4913	Setup has been stable with the Linksys fw on the 610.	1
4914	"The WRT fw on this 160 allows you to adjust power more granularly so range is great, but performance in this bridged mode is abysmal."	1
4915	I have added a couple Netgear WNDR dual bands with each band having a guest network providing up to 4 networks in one router.	0
4916	The Netgears have fewer settings than the Cisco (huh?!	0
4917	"and you cannot choose b, b/g, g, b/g/n, n-only (as you probably know, mixing drops performance considerably)."	1
4918	You can only choose Up to [nn[n]] speed indicating some type of mixed mode when you get into the g and n ranges - very bad.	0
4919	"However, firmware updates directly from the Internet is great, stability is awesome and range is MUCH better than both the 160 and 610 Linsyses (Linksi?)."	1
4920	"You can also easily setup multiple in a bridge mode (though can only use WEP or open in this mode, which is stupid so should never be used unless you have no security needs)."	0
4921	"Other nits, but much better than the 160 or 610 and Im glad I came across them"	1
4922	"One last thing on these Linksyses: differences between V1 and V2 and V3 is the V1 is severely underpowered from a processor, RAM and ROM perspective - the V2 has a much more powerful processor, more RAM/ROM thus improving performance in the testing Ive done."	0
4923	"Netgears still win here, but its Amazing that Cisco recognized a major issue and quickly started shipping a V2 w/out offering some type of incentive or trade-in for people stuck with the V1 (most likely those who would notice something like this would be power users like me so they wouldnt go broke)."	0
4924	Its even obvious in running their web settings interface sometimes taking over 20 seconds just to navigate to the next screen whereas other brands are instant.	0
4925	"This plus knowing they arent likely to push out much, if any, new firmware to address issues they have, ruins their credibility with me and trust with buying additional hardware"	0
4926	Im not going to drag this out and list every feature.	0
4927	I am going to provide a few words of caution and recommend looking elsewhere.	1
4928	I am absolutely baffled by those who give this 5 stars or claim that it works great or has any range.	1
4929	"If you choose to roll the dice, I hope you have much better luck than I"	1
4930	I have used (and still own) many wireless routers over the years.	0
4931	This is easily the worst.	0
4932	Im not your average hobbyist or someone who doesnt know much about these.	1
4933	I am a long-time technologist who understands this to the lowest protocol layer or give you an in depth lesson of TKIP vs. AES and various modes of AES operation if you feel like being bored	0
4934	I bought this to replace another Linksys with this and have been extremely disappointed.	0
4935	"RangePlus and claims that one can use throughout a house, in the yard, etc."	1
4936	are simply ridiculous.	0
4937	I have a number of devices in the house.	1
4938	A Tivo about 25 feet away went from an excellent signal of 92-96(as measured by its meter) to 38-56 222532972th this unit.	1
4939	A downstairs bedroom about 75 away that provided my iPhone and Mac pro both with full bars have gone to ZERO.	1
4940	Upstairs master - same devices have Zero signal	1
4941	"I have tried talking to the incompetents at Cisco, uh, Linksys - whoever with no luck."	1
4942	"No settings to tweak really if you have B, G and N devices."	1
4943	"Testing, I switched to B&G option only - no improvement."	1
4944	N only - nothing	1
4945	"While testing signal with more advanced equipment, I have moved it, moved equipment away from it, reset it, verified firmware, etc."	1
4946	etc.	0
4947	No improvement	1
4948	"Bottom line: terrible performance compared to anything I have used and in simple side-by-side testing (only one on at a time of course).Old Linksys has been reinstalled, this one going back - thanks to Amazon for easy return."	1
4949	A+ product!!!	1
4950	Dont buy a wireless G. Spend a little more and get the Wireless N.  Would recommend to anyone who needs wi-fi throughout their home/garage.	1
4951	"before two months were up, the wireless part gave out."	0
4952	"My IT guy was very surprised by that, and so am I."	1
4953	"Of course, murphys law dictated that it had to give out when I was trying to connect and apply for a fabulous job opportunity .. which I missed the deadline for, in small part because THIS DAMN THING DOESNT WORK!"	0
4954	"It does still work with a cable, but of course I didnt have one handy at the time -- why would I; I have a wireless router!"	0
4955	sigh).	0
4956	"works fine, but i have 2 apples."	1
4957	"the macs, not the fruit."	0
4958	could not get it to work with the installation disc.	0
4959	"finally called support, very nice lady in india?"	1
4960	lotsa laughing and talking in background	0
4961	"she told me the disc didnt work at all on apple, though i had been able to start the process"	0
4962	"anyway, she got it up and running with not too much trouble."	1
4963	took a while though	0
4964	would have been nice for cisco/linksys to WARN APPLE OWNERS before we waste our time trying to figure things out.!	0
4965	"This was the first time I used a wireless router, and it was simple to follow"	0
4966	A friend suggested that this router would be what I needed to go wireless.	0
4967	"I knew, and still dont know, much at all about setting up a wireless network at home."	1
4968	"Well, with this product, you dont need to"	1
4969	Ive purchased a ton of gadgets and gizmos over the years.	1
4970	"But none, NONE, have ever been this user friendly and easy to set up."	1
4971	I imagined hassles and additional purchases in my way of using my laptop wirelessly.... but this product made it super-simple even for a non-techie like me!I would recommend this product to anyone that needs to set up a wireless-N signal in their house or small business	1
4972	Highly recommend!	1
4973	i have both a pc and mac.	1
4974	i also live in a house made of concrete block (including the interior walls).	1
4975	the signal of this wireless router works great throughout my house.	1
4976	i have cable internet.	0
4977	ive had no problems streaming movies.	0
4978	"in fact, i believe that im actually getting a faster data stream with the wireless than i had being hooked up to the internet via the wire/cable"	1
4979	im a newbie when it comes to this type of thing.	0
4980	"so, it took me a couple of days to get it set up right."	1
4981	that was a little frustrating.	0
4982	it wasnt quite as easy as the installation instructions/disc led me to believe.	1
4983	"however, the tech support on their website was very helpful."	0
4984	it answered my questions and got me up and working with both my computers.	0
4985	"When I got it out of the box and followed installation instructions, running the included setup software on the CD, the software program told me Configuration Failed."	0
4986	"I repeated this several times, always getting Setup is unable to configure your network."	0
4987	"I was just about to give up and return the router, when my son noticed a strong signal on his PDA."	1
4988	"In fact, the router was already working fine!"	1
4989	We then set up our home network with no problem at all.	0
4990	"Signals are strong, connections are fast, even from 2 floors away."	1
4991	"Not sure what went wrong with the setup program, but dont be too quick to believe what it tells you; check your connection yourself."	0
4992	I had been wanting to go wireless for quite a while but was nervous about spending money on something I couldnt get to work.	0
4993	I took the plunge and it works great!	1
4994	"The instructions were concise, short and accurate."	1
4995	I got it to work on the first try!!	1
4996	I can now use our laptop anywhere in the house.	1
4997	I can also bring my laptop from work and hook right up.	1
4998	Im very happy being wireless and with teh Linksys WRT160N.	1
4999	Nice router.	1
5000	"Great set up wizard, simple, however it widnt work for me (this was my first time to set up a wireless Network)."	1
5001	Contacted Cisco support and spent an hour talking with a lady I couldnt understand (to much accent).	1
5002	She gave up and quit.	0
5003	I went to Cisco again and downloaded different instructions and it worked great.	1
5004	Good reception anywhere in the house for the laptop.	1
5005	Xbox 360 wireless works great even on Call of Duty World at War on line.	1
5006	I replaced a Linksys 802.11b router (that was still working fine) and realized a 4x increase in speed on my DSL connection.	1
5007	"I wouldnt have believed this possible, but I had done at least 10 tests with the previous router, and did at least as many with the new one."	0
5008	An amazing benefit from a $60-$70 expense.	1
5009	Was easily configured.	0
5010	Our variety of other wireless brand devices have no trouble linking to it.	0
5011	"After installing the software on my computers, I plugged in the new Router,rebooted my modem and everything worked on the first try, even my WII console"	1
5012	It is faster and has more range than my old G Router as well as having better security features	1
5013	Next thing I will try to setup with my home network is my new HDTV.	0
5014	Purchased the Linksys WRT160N as upgrade to a wireless G router.	0
5015	"The set-up was easy, the wireless coverage was good, but the wired connection was defective."	1
5016	Unable to connect to Internet about 501520712554f the time.	0
5017	"Constantly refreshing, shutting down, and restarting."	0
5018	Updated firmware and changed some configuration settings with help from some product experts - but problem remained.	0
5019	Researched the problem and discovered that it is a common issue with this router.	0
5020	Linksys doesnt have a fix	0
5021	I returned the router and purchased D-Link DIR-655 instead.	1
5022	So far everything has worked great with the D-Link.	1
5023	"When my old reliable D-link finally died, I needed a new router quick!"	0
5024	This router stood out because it offered newer technology while being compatible with my particular equipment	1
5025	I couldnt be happier.	1
5026	Heres my take on this router:1.	0
5027	Quick and easy install.	1
5028	"I plugged this router in, and it worked ."	1
5029	"immediately, flawlessly.2."	1
5030	No drops.	0
5031	"In the weeks Ive been using it, Ive never lost connectivity.3."	0
5032	"I do not notice any increase in speed; however, this may be a function of my DSL line rather than the router itself.4."	0
5033	Looks good on my desk.	1
5034	"OK, this is merely a matter of preference, but I do like the looks of this sleek, black router much more than the silver and blue box I had before"	1
5035	"Im no electronics wizard, so if it works for me without having to wait for customer support, Im a very happy camper."	1
5036	"It does, and I am"	0
5037	Five stars!	1
5038	The product didnt work out of the box.	1
5039	I had to call Linksys 24/7 support and talked to them for 3 hours until we got the problem resolved.	0
5040	But once it was working this device is a beauty.	1
5041	I had an Apple Airport Express which was terrible and had very limited range.	0
5042	The range on this router is incredible and the speeds are great even when many people are connected to it at once.	1
5043	If I had just gotten it to work without having to call customer support I would have given this product 5/5 stars.	1
5044	I bought this to use with a hardwired home PC network and wireless connectivity.	0
5045	"The unit is fast and easy to set-up, but worthless with the current firmware."	1
5046	One out of every ten attempts to connect to the internet fail intermittently.	0
5047	A search for the problem found dozens of people having the same issue with the current firmware.	0
5048	Linksys tech support has no current fix.	0
5049	I am not running any special configuration or computers.	1
5050	I was replacing an older netgear router and wireless router to consolidate to one device.	0
5051	Everything worked perfect before the switch.	1
5052	DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE...	1
5053	WAIT UNTIL LINKSYS HAS A FIX!	0
5054	Maybe the WRT160N v1 was a decent Wireless-N router.	0
5055	"Its hard to know, since Linksys now makes only the newer version-2 router, which is awful as a Wireless-N router."	0
5056	The main problem (and it is a critical one) is that the newer version makes it impossible to both enable the Wide radio band (which delivers the increased bandwidth with wireless-N) and select the channels you want to use (which with the popularity of WiFi and interference arousing from neighboring routers is an absolute necessity).	0
5057	"The wide radio band is only enabled if you set the options all to auto, which prevents you from selecting the desired channels."	1
5058	"If you want Wireless-N speeds, youre stuck using channel 1, whether you like it or not"	0
5059	This is a poor excuse for a router.	0
5060	Selecting the channels to use has been a baseline feature for wireless routers for almost a decade now.	0
5061	Linksys ought to be embarassed for selling this piece of crap.	0
5062	This is a great product.	1
5063	It hooked up very easily and works wonderfully.	1
5064	And Amazon had a great deal on it.	1
5065	After I installed the router the DNS lookup kept timing out when I was trying access the internet.	0
5066	I was connected but the DNS lookup is slow and intermittent.	0
5067	The help support has not been able to resolve my issues to this point.	0
5068	"The linksys technical forum shows that other people are having this problem as well, but no solutions to this point."	0
5069	The issue seems to appear for some people with the introduction of firmware build 11.	0
5070	It might also be linked to people using cable modems.	1
5071	I would not recommend this product at this time.	1
5072	I purchased this router to replace my old 54G.	0
5073	It took me a whole night trying to set it up with no luck.	1
5074	The CD didnt work on my laptop partially because my wireless set up is not based on windows wireless (its an Intel).	1
5075	Error messages appeared for many times and the set up program also failed (died) for a few times.	0
5076	Eventually I followed the instruction on Linksys website to use the web-based router setup.	0
5077	It seemed to be working for a while but then my IP address disappeared.	0
5078	I couldnt use ipconfig commands to recover my IP so I had to call Roadrunner (my highspeed provider) to reset everything.	1
5079	I called Road runner for at least 6 times to reset my IP	1
5080	I also called Linksys 24/7 support.	0
5081	I found it not useful at all.	1
5082	Its also very hard to hear people from India because they have very loud background noise	0
5083	"So after 7 hours of struggle, I gave up."	0
5084	I went back to my old 54G router and it was setup trouble-free and it worked perfectly.	1
5085	I wish Linksys tested their products more before they released to the market.	0
5086	"Attaching a hard copy of the web-based instruction will help tremendously too - how can anybody go online to get the instructions without internet?I think that its a nice thing to have a N series router home, but I really hope that they can fix all the bugs related to the setup process"	0
5087	Im returning the router waiting for them to fix the product issues.	0
5088	Its very disappointing indeed.	0
5089	I had a computor store set up my first router with the laptop for $100.00 including a Belken router- I didnt know diddly beans about routers (Still dont)....BAD Mistake- it quit on me in a few months and knocked my desktop offline too- and never did reach as far as I needed it to...anyway the store insisted it tested fine BUT I couldnt get to work at home and if I connected it it I lost my desktop!	0
5090	was at Meiers one night and they had this for $50 on sale - decided to try again.....This computor dummy (ME) had NO problems at all installing it and now both computors work online perfectly....Mine is XP and the laptop is Vista....just write down the codes when installing so you dont have to go looking for them to connect other devices like a laptop	1
5091	"Owned this for 2 months, my laptop wouldnt even work when in security mode, my other desktop with a linksys adapter was thrown off frequently, it also would throw off my computer connected to it,would have to disconnect power and reconnect,  finally had to take it back and replace with dlink, that i have now had for 2 days and no problems."	0
5092	I have had this router in operation for over a month.	0
5093	It has performed perfectly without a single drop out.	1
5094	I am using it to link my media extender to the TV and it seems to be a good match.	1
5095	It also seems to be faster than my old G router when using my laptop even though the laptop does not have N capability	1
5096	The installation was very easy including setting up the security	1
5097	I would purchase this router again.	1
5098	This product is terrible and is only reliable if it works out of the box and fits into  the simple brain-dead configurations provided by the vendor.	0
5099	I own other Linksys products which are excellent and have owned other wireless devices that have worked flawlessly and this is NOT one of them.	1
5100	The negative reviews regarding support and the awful and extremely slow installation program are spot on.	0
5101	"If this device works for you great leave it alone and just run it, and dont ever be tempted to depress the so-called reset button (for factory defaults) or you will be hauling this hunk of junk back to where you bought it if there is a return policy."	0
5102	"Setup was very simple with the new LELA assistant, I even was able to have my non-technical friend get it up and running before I got there."	0
5103	"The advanced menus are the same as all the other standard ones, so I got the encryption, port forwarding, and bridging setup quickly and easily."	1
5104	"Range and speed were good, was able to play on Xbox Live and stream video without lag"	1
5105	"The only problem I had was 192.168.1.1 would not connect forever on IE or Chrome, I had to reset the router and DL Firefox 3 before I was able to get into the advanced setup"	0
5106	This product is good and is the best looking product on the market by far.	1
5107	However it was not as easy to set-up for wireless connections as everyone seemed to make out it was.	1
5108	"I would recommend this product but if like me you encouter some issues I did not find it the easiest to resolve through the help section, instead I searched the internet and forums."	0
5109	Is working fine now and no further issues.	1
5110	Sucks!	0
5111	Suxs!	0
5112	Linksys has the worst software  Router makes a cool looking paperweight.	0
5113	I bought this router 5 Months ago after a fair amount of research online.	0
5114	Ive been putting off buying a wireless router for 7-8 years now - i thought wired worked for me just fine.	1
5115	"But every since we got it, its opened a new world to me; now we found uses for our laptops that we didnt think of before."	0
5116	like watching online video in the kitchen with the family; or checking recipes online right from the kitchen or checking email without going all the way to the desktop	1
5117	"The router does all that i needed it to, and was v2 (so i can flash it with DD-WRT, if necessary - havent had the need to, so far)."	1
5118	"the router setup was a no brainer, all features work as intended."	0
5119	Has all the latest security features etc.	0
5120	"I get pretty decent speed with it - havent tested the 802.1N speeds, though."	1
5121	No issues with the range - i have it on the lower level of the house and get excellent reception on the deck outside on the upper level about 30-35 feet away thru interior walls and floor (i havent tried longer distance than that).	1
5122	Im happy with it	1
5123	"Im pretty technical, so I read about all the stuff you can do by flashing the firmware, without being sure whether i would really need to or not - i"	1
5124	the info made me kind of nervous whether the default firmware is somehow inadequate - but I neednt have worried.	0
5125	I also needed to know if the router would support older encryption protocols like WEP and newer protocols like WPA - since i have an older PowerBook and PCs and newer laptops.	1
5126	The Amazon website description didnt really give me this type of detail (neither did it tell me whether this was v1 or v2 of the router model).	0
5127	i bought it anyway and was not disappointed	0
5128	"i went with Amazon despite another lower cost online site, because Amazon chose to give me great technical info to make my decision and for the peace of mind that if the product wasnt up to expectations i could return without any worries."	1
5129	i havent needed to.	0
5130	:-)definitely 5 stars.	1
5131	I bought and set up this router about 4 months ago.	0
5132	Have a had any problems with it as of now?	0
5133	Absolutely not.	0
5134	Any kind of internet problems were from my provider and not the router.	0
5135	I am extremely pleased with the Linksys Ultra RangePlus Wireless-N Router.	1
5136	:)	0
5137	From day one I am Linksys product fan.	0
5138	"I had high expectation for this product, and some what I am satisfied."	1
5139	"N should give me good coverage, and it did, but not with good signal strength in my downstair bedroom."	1
5140	I am still able to connect.	0
5141	So I am happy with this.	1
5142	"The Linksys RangePlus Wireless-N router works very well, but the documentation that comes with the router is poor, to say the least."	1
5143	"Some documentation is available on a CD, but it must be installed in the form of a program on the computer."	1
5144	The system requirements of the documentation program are so great that it wont even function on my computer.	1
5145	This is very agrivating.	0
5146	"This beautiful bit of design installed nicely, worked for a whole six weeks, and now fails to connect with *one* of my email providers."	1
5147	"Ive reinstalled the software, re-upped the firmware, rebooted the router, modem and computer multiple times, and spent hours searching forums and in lovely online chats with Linksys Live Advisors."	1
5148	"My gears are stripped, my tires are blown, and Im now using it as a paperweight"	0
5149	"My computer wired stright to the modem works fine, so its not in my email application, ISP, email srever, virus checker, firewall or in the stars."	1
5150	"Maybe it will work for you, but do yourself a favor and read the one- and two-star ratings on Amazon and check the email threads on Linksys forums before you click Add to Cart"	1
5151	POd in Parksville	1
5152	"After 3 or 4 hours with LinkSys support (2nd level support included), since they could not get it to work, they told me to take my Laptop back to the manufacturer to get the wireless switch fixed on my machine, which of course, was working fine before trying to install this LinkSys Router and of course, worked fine after I unhooked everything (and wirelessly connected to someone in the neigborhoods wireless router), packed it up and shipped it back to LinkSys."	1
5153	Their Technical Support as well as their product leaves a lot to be desired.	1
5154	"This wireless router does a great job and looks sweet, but I went through a frustrating couple of hours to get it working properly."	1
5155	The set up information you receive is very basic and the product description (what the led and ports are is better on this page than you get in the box)is pretty much only what you see on the box.	1
5156	I went through the basic set up procedure but after the hardware was set up I got an error message that there was no internet connection detected and the set up was halted.	0
5157	Now as soon as I set my modem back up without the router I had internet again so I knew I had internet.	0
5158	"There is also a trouble shooting FAQ included with the router which addresses this outcome and involves shutting down the modem, router and pc then turning them back on in sequence."	0
5159	I tried that but it did not solve the problem.	0
5160	Ok so then I had to again disconnect the router to get back my internet connection and go to the lynksys website.	0
5161	Under the product information section for this routher there is also a FAQ troubleshoooting section and the very first question is dealing with the lack of internet connection during set up.	0
5162	"This response involves opening up your browser, going to a website and making changes in the IP address for the router -I think- (Im all thumbs when it comes to this stuff) and saving that information."	0
5163	"Then, after you make these changes, if you go through the basic set up it works."	1
5164	Hopefully this reveiw will save people time if they run into the same situation	0
5165	Once you set it up it works great.	1
5166	My xbox 360 is across the house through a few rooms and walls and the reception is outstanding	1
5167	Be sure to save a copy of your password and SSID to your desktop which is in the last step of your basic set up since this info is necessary for coordinating your wireless systems.	0
5168	I just find this router on AMAZON	1
5169	COM with the best price i could find on my area or even on webs and like the router.	1
5170	it comes with the advisory program that give you manage your wireless internet or even solve problem connection	0
5171	very easy to setup even if you dont know how install the program just follow the instruction when you insert the CD (coming with the router) and you will be OK	0
5172	I connect 3 computer to that router and thank God I dont have any problem with that.	0
5173	The installation was a bit rocky at the start.	0
5174	The easy setup CD simply did not work at all.	0
5175	"It failed to detect the modem, although it was properly connected."	0
5176	"So I called the 24/7 tech support, they answered with a message that said they had an unusually high volume of calls, and instead of queuing the call and asking me to wait, they told me to call back later and then actually disconnected me."	0
5177	Somethings amiss in that call center	0
5178	Steam was beginning to come out of my ears.	0
5179	"I called back immediately and got right through to a very nice and very capable rep in India, who walked me through the manual setup flawlessly, and had all 4 of my various devices up and running perfectly in minutes."	1
5180	"In 7 days, I have experienced only one of the dreaded lock-ups requiring power-off-on reset."	0
5181	"Seems to run faster than my old Buffalo, which had just suddenly decided to stop working."	1
5182	"I had a pair of Buffalo units to cover the whole house, and this single unit at one end, where the cable comes in to my house, seems to be doing the same job"	1
5183	"I have not tried to mix G and N yet, and Im a little concerned about the review that said this is problematic."	0
5184	"Ill keep my fingers crossed, and report back when I get my N laptop."	1
5185	it works pretty well.	1
5186	I suck at setting these things up but this machine is so easy.	1
5187	You just plug it in and download the software that it comes with and you are done!	0
5188	its great.	1
5189	This replaced my three-year old wireless Netgear router.	0
5190	Took about 20 mintues to set up the wireless service and connect to my Roadrunner cable modem	1
5191	"I have two devices wired to the router; XP desktop and DirecTV HD Reciever, and I have 6 devices connected via Wi-Fi, including two iPhones, a 64bit Vista HP Laptop, one XP laptop, one XP Desktop, and one Linksys wireless print server"	1
5192	"The only problem I had was getting the wireless printing to work, and this was solved by using a step-by-step setup found on the Linksys user forum after a quick google search."	0
5193	It took about 45min follow the guide from the user forum to set up wireless printing for all four of my computers	0
5194	Connection is always up and provides plenty of bandwidth to play Eve On-line over Wi-Fi with all devices connected and with no game lag.	0
5195	"Despite the printer issue, I love this router."	0
5196	I was also able to take it to my in-laws for a one-week vacation and connect it to their DSL service in about 5 minutes	0
5197	System has been running for over one month and has been flawless since initial setup.	1
5198	"Last note, all Wi-Fi devices are from Linksys and are ultra-N(router, printer, and desktop USB)."	1
5199	I did not trust that wireless N would work well if mixing multiple vendor products.	1
5200	When my WRT54G stopped finding the internet I went with the WRT160N.	1
5201	You must follow the directions and it took about an hour and the registation site had a firmware upgrade which did not come up went I installed the unit	0
5202	I did the upgrade and while I was in the software I wanted to disengage the broadcast signal which was available on the old 54G.	1
5203	After going through the software 3x I did find the appropriate selection.	1
5204	It is in the wireless>manual selection.	1
5205	It is working great.	1
5206	This is a terrible product.	0
5207	"It seems to have all the features on paper, but the problem is that it regularly locks up."	0
5208	"To get my internet back, I have to pull the power (because there is no power switch....) for a few seconds, then re-plug it."	0
5209	"After that, is comes back OK.....until the next hang"	0
5210	"Also, the software interface is rather poor."	0
5211	I recently had a string of bad luck while trying to replace my ancient B router.	0
5212	After going through 3 other routers of different brands I finally decided to buy this one.	0
5213	Routers can have all sorts of problems while setting them up and I think I encountered a lot of them in a short amount of time.	0
5214	After buying this one I reluctantly started setting it up and was pleasantly surprised to get it up and going in no time!This one also has a lot of extra options that make it the best out there for your money.	1
5215	"I connected a laptop, a PSP, and a PS3 to my new network with NO problems whatsoever."	0
5216	The range on this router is amazing.	1
5217	It gives a strong 100ignal no matter where you put it in the house.	1
5218	"I have my PS3 in a cabinet and could only get about 80tops with other N routers, but Im always running at 100 222532972th the Linksys."	1
5219	I havent had to reboot it since Ive bought it and my internet speed is truly amazing.	0
5220	Faster than ever even on my wired computer!	1
5221	Believe it or not my speed is almost twice as fast as if I just ran my internet directly through my modem!	1
5222	Its also really easy to monitor your network to see if there are any freeloaders on it.	1
5223	Security is also a breeze with this beauty.	1
5224	I couldnt recommend a better router in this price range.	1
5225	This is definitely the one to buy!I hope you consider this one because if you try to save a few bucks by buying a cheaper brand or version you will just end up with headaches.	0
5226	I found this out the hard way through trial and error.	0
5227	Trust me on this one.	1
5228	Thanks for your time.	1
5229	Good luck.	1
5230	I have had some problems with this unit.	0
5231	The automatic setup routine did not work.	0
5232	Would not connect to the unit.	0
5233	"The wireless signal is constantly disconnecting, seems to be subject to interference."	0
5234	I am still trying different settings to try to decrease this.	0
5235	"Despite reviews stating that the WRT160N had a lot of units that would lock up after a short time, I picked up one at the local Wal-Mart."	0
5236	"not as good a price as Amazon, but immediately returnable)."	1
5237	"Of course, over a weeks time, it was very consistent: 10 to 12 hours and it locked up tight as a drum, only way to recover was to pull the plug, and then it was good for another 10-12 hours."	1
5238	Placing a fan on the router with 1 clearance underneath did not solve the problem.	0
5239	"Returned, got another one."	0
5240	Exactly the same symptoms.	0
5241	"Returned, ordered a D-Link DIR 825 Xtreme Dual Band Gigabit Router (and an 8 port Gb D-Link Switch).Great service from Amazon, as always."	1
5242	Wonderful products so far.	1
5243	"I will write a separate review on the 825.I couldnt recommend the WRT160N to anyone....some have good luck with them, but far too many have had EXACTLY the same failure mode as my two units showed."	1
5244	I had ordered this router to replace the Belkin product I had because it kept dropping the wireless signal.	0
5245	Only a few days after installation I encountered problems with it and spent an hour with technical with Linksys to no avail.	0
5246	At this point I do not give them a very good rating on service because they didnt seemingly want to replace a faulty router.	0
5247	I of course reported this to Amazon and returned the old router and received a replacement in 2 days.	0
5248	Hats off to Amazon for great service.	1
5249	The router works fine and for the price was an excellent choice to replace the Belkin product which I would probably never go back to.	1
5250	"Im not a Linksys fan, but this works very well, has terrific range, and is easy to setup."	1
5251	Very easy and straight forward installation - up and running in about 15 minutes.	1
5252	Havent observed any remarkable increase in wireless signal strength or increase in reception distance as I had expected from this new device over my old Linksys wireless router.	1
5253	"This router works very well, I have both Windows Vista and XP computers and an XP laptop and a printer all connected to it."	1
5254	The laptop is wireless connection.	0
5255	"It was easy to install, but had trouble getting my settings correct."	1
5256	I called Linksys and they walked me through the settings.	0
5257	They were very patient and had me up and running in short time.	1
5258	Very fast speed and I am extremely satisfied.	1
5259	Highly reccomend this product.	1
5260	This has been a very good router so far (5 weeks).	1
5261	"The setup was a breeze, connection times are quick and I have not yet had a dropped connection or needed to reboot."	0
5262	The downside is that the range is less than stellar.	0
5263	"I have a relatively small home, and the signal strength drops off fairly quickly as you move away from the router."	1
5264	I	0
5265	"if you have a larger home, you may want to consider a different router."	1
5266	It was very easy to switch out routers.	1
5267	"Pretty much unplug the Wireless G  I had ,plug in the new one and it configured itself with a few tweeks"	1
5268	so far so good..  A+++	1
5269	"I bought this somewhat cautiously, but someone had recommended it and the price was right."	1
5270	I was concerned about the reports of heat generation in a few readers reviews.	0
5271	"So, when I got it I built an inverted u-shaped platform, about 6 hi and 8 wide, and I put a large hole in the center--to increase the air flow."	0
5272	"It now appears that it wasnt necessary, as the unit was only very slightly warm to the touch and never grew hot."	1
5273	"At one point during the election, we had up to (8) laptops running off of it (I have a cable modem ahead of the router)."	0
5274	We dropped a connection only once or twice over a period of several days.	0
5275	I have disconnected my ethernet and use the wireless link from my new laptop.	0
5276	"The setup was very easy: I replaced a Linksys BEFSX41 ethernet router with this, but I had to power down the modem and re-power it up to finish the install."	0
5277	"My friend suggested that I set it up for the 26 digit security code, and that was seamless."	1
5278	I do use two of the ethernet connections for the desktops I have.	0
5279	"As of this writing, its been installed for a month, and I am quite satisfied."	1
5280	"This is a great router, i think the rest of the reviews cover pretty much everything there is to say about it, the only reason I dont give it 5 stars is because in my case the remote reboot option is very important, an Linksys does not include this option in the firmware."	1
5281	"Other than that it works great, I have great signal everywhere in my house, an even in my neighbors house :p. Configuration is pretty easy too."	1
5282	"I bought this as a replacement for my very old, but still working D-Link a router, hoping for better range and throughput on my DSL line."	0
5283	"I suppose the Linksys N router does what it is supposed to be, and the firmware settings site is fine."	1
5284	Ive configure some before and its really no big deal going through the tabs the router puts up on its internal mini-config site	0
5285	Then the horror story happened.	1
5286	By mistake I clicked on a link on the included CD that installs this LELA configuration utility.	0
5287	When I realized what I had done it was too late.	1
5288	"The install kept crashing on my Win XP laptop, eventually half-way installed drivers and managers for my wireless network that overrode the perfectly working Windows drivers I had so I lost connection to all wireless networks."	0
5289	My machine got is such a bad state that I also lost wired LAN access.	0
5290	Trying to uninstall their software only made things worse to the point that Ive had to reinstall XP and am still doing that	0
5291	DO NOT pop in their CD.	1
5292	Do the configuration yourself by connecting to the router through an ethernet cable and save yourself the trouble!	0
5293	i bought this product and i have been using it for a month.	0
5294	i find it fast and it gives a good range.	1
5295	but it is not the range thati was expecting.	0
5296	my roomate also said that it disconnects every 30 mins to every hour.	0
5297	i never experince a disconnection on it	0
5298	its of course better than the D-Link that i had b4.	1
5299	"that one just keeps disconnecting eveytime, for several minutes and than it goes back for about 30min to 2 hrs."	0
5300	and then it does several disconnections.	0
5301	it just messed up my work	0
5302	so i find this one better and the network coverge is much way better.	1
5303	I did the installation in a couple of minutes.	0
5304	I always mess up software installations.	0
5305	I was a little worried this time.	0
5306	But its EASY.	1
5307	I have two laptops.	1
5308	"One vista, one xp."	1
5309	I had a really old linksys router which no longer works.	1
5310	"I cant believe how easy the setup is, or I am just being super lucky today."	1
5311	Cable: Comcast.	1
5312	Thank you linksys!	1
5313	I bought this one to set up all my home networks.	0
5314	I have 3 PCs and 4 notebooks.	0
5315	I wanted to use 1 PC as a file server and connect all the other computers to it.	0
5316	So I need a faster wireless router.	1
5317	I installed the router and it worked so so to connect to the internet.	1
5318	But when I tried to connect my own PCs its way TOOOOOO slow I cant even use it.	0
5319	My file server located at a room where I cant connect through wire so I bought linksys N wireless network card hoping that itll work well because they all are from same company.	1
5320	I tried all the PCs to connect to the file server but all of them are too slow to share anything.	0
5321	I have to change the router again.	0
5322	i bought this router to replace an old linksys d-link router.	0
5323	so basically i was just upgrading products and inserting it into the exact same network.	0
5324	i was at least expecting the same if not better performance.	1
5325	what i was not expecting is worse performance.	0
5326	"the range isnt as good, although theoretically it should be better."	1
5327	"also, it seriously cuts down my internect speed."	1
5328	ive been on the phone with linksys twice now to see if they could help me solve the problem but they werent able to help me.	0
5329	im very disappointed with this product.	0
5330	After my LinkSys WRT54G I thought the WRT160N would be the best to run my onboard N card on my HP Laptop at the same time run my kids G cards on their laptops.	1
5331	"Unfortunately, the router was dropping connections every few minutes on both N and G when they were running concurrently."	0
5332	"After some research I found that the attena design mucks up when it has to manage both N and G. I might be mistaken but, you dont get the extra range features of N when it has to use some of the antennas for the G. Also, Im not so sure that you would get full functionality of the N and other router features unless you purchase the fully compatible Ultra RangePlus N and G cards for your computer."	1
5333	The product is not so usefull without the concurrent dual capability that was expected	1
5334	"So, I returned it and carefully chose a Netgear RangeMax DualBand Wireless N WNDR3300 for a few dollars more."	0
5335	This router broadcasts both N and G as if it were two routers and it has worked flawlessly over the past week or so.	1
5336	"Mine was unreliable, as it would freeze, and require a reboot from time to time -- a real PITA since it was installed in my vacation home 250 miles away, and was used to monitor automation systems in the home remotely."	0
5337	"I checked the Linksys Support Site, and discovered that others had problems with this unit."	0
5338	"The Linksys Tech that monitors the board suggested a third party firmware, but noted Linksys would not support the product with this solution."	0
5339	Mine went to local electronic recycling.	0
5340	I wrote a letter to John Chambers asking for a refund (it was beyond the time limit of Best Buy to return) and his guy called me and essentially told me to pound sand.	1
5341	"I installed a D-Link DIR-655 it its place a few months ago, and it works great -- has much better reviews in Amazon too."	1
5342	I am very satisfied with this product.	1
5343	It was very easy to set up and use.	1
5344	I have two laptops that are both connected wirelessly through this device.	1
5345	"The speed on my newer laptop is 65.0 Mbps, the older one shows 50.0 Mbps."	1
5346	I read as many reviews as I can prior to buy this router because Im novice setting up PC related stuff but this router was very easy to set up and all my fears vanished once I ended up with the procedure.	0
5347	I wired a PC with Windows XP 32 bits and then wirelessly a laptop with Windows Vista Home Premium 64 bits	0
5348	Everything is working fine.	1
5349	I was very dissapointed in my purchase of this product.	0
5350	"As Im writing you all this review, Ive been on the phone with Liksys for over 2hrs trying to get an explanation why the advertised USB connection, advertised as i"	0
5351	"available for external storage device, is not being detected by my Laptop (This is what was most appealing to me about the product)."	1
5352	"Not only has this been terribly time consumming, but at the price ($189) I do not expect to run into these kind of troubles."	0
5353	"I have been a very satisfied customer using Linksys products in the past but this aftercare service by Linksys tech support and non-functional product has driven me to inform all of you that care to know, to be very aware that this product and its representatives are not all they promise to be."	1
5354	"Their tech support is seperated by levels, the higher the level the more knowledgable they are supposed to be - not so!"	1
5355	They couldnt even realize 2hrs into the conversation after having asked me already that I was working of Windows Vista!	0
5356	Back to the router :-)  The range is not all that grand for a supposed 5ghz router.	1
5357	I use it for gaming as well and have not found any problems with it.	0
5358	"When I move my laptop around however, just a good 10+ yds from the router and you can loose some serious speed."	0
5359	"So again, be wary about this one."	0
5360	"For the price there has to be a better router than this...ideas are definitely welcomed, especially if anyone knows of a router that has the capability to allow USB connections...."	1
5361	"I was a bit hesitant about this router based on some of the less than stellar reviews, but Im very happy that I bought it anyway"	1
5362	We have two laptops that share an internet connection and are networked as well.	1
5363	The router setup was a breeze with no problems whatsoever.	0
5364	I popped in the setup CD and it pretty much did everything for me automatically after that.	0
5365	"I think it took me less than 30 minutes from the time I ripped the router package open to the time I was surfing the net, if that much"	0
5366	"We use satellite internet and sometimes the connection is less than stellar, messing up the modem which then needs to be reset."	0
5367	When that happened my old Linksys modem (54G) would sometimes get confused and need to be reset too.	0
5368	"No problems with this one whatsoever, as soon as the modem is reset, the internet connection to both computers is up and running automatically again"	0
5369	"Assuming that it continues to function as well as it has for the first month, this was a great purchase."	1
5370	"I thought this unit would give me more range, but it hasnt seem to do that over the old Linksys N router I have."	0
5371	"I dont often give a product 5-stars, but the Linksys Ultra RangePlus Wireless-N Router has exceeded my expectations"	1
5372	"First, its very sleek in appearance, a nice reflective black surface and blue status LEDs match some of my other components and looks very elegant and modern."	1
5373	Did I mention theres no visible antenna?	0
5374	Its hidden in the unit.	1
5375	"The LEDs are not distractingly bright, which is good since I watch movies on a TV about 2 feet from this puppy"	1
5376	"As far as functionality goes, this router seems to do everything I need."	0
5377	"It could have worked out of the box, but I wanted WEP encryption just like my old wireless-G network had that I was replacing."	1
5378	"The configuration menus can be a bit overwhelming to a novice (and I personally find that Linksys menus are a little more tedious to navigate than their competitors), but all the functionality is there and once you know where its at, changing a setting is a cinch"	0
5379	I didnt install the included software and dont really find a need for it.	1
5380	"Again, with a few glances in the book, hooking up the power cable and your modem and ethernet cables, this thing will be running straight out of the box"	0
5381	The performance is fantastic!	1
5382	"I was running a Netgear Wireless-G router previous to this, and I couldnt get a signal in my corner bedroom upstairs (the router is setup on the main floor by all my video game systems)."	0
5383	"With this puppy, I get a fantastic signal everywhere in my house."	1
5384	"Unlike my routers of the past, Ive -never- had to reboot this one"	0
5385	"Overall, the product meets and even exceeds my expectations."	1
5386	Im sure there are other Wireless-N routers available that would do the same.	1
5387	"However, what makes this product so much better is that the price is VERY inexpensive in comparison to other Wireless-N routers out there."	1
5388	"For the casual users, gamers, and the families looking to setup a wireless network, this router is for you."	0
5389	"If youre one of those technophiles that isnt satisfied unless youve got the greatest hardware in existence, you can probably find something better for two- to three-times the price."	1
5390	I just tried to replace my old Linksys Wireless B router and remote antenna (which were working well) with the WRT160N and a Dual-Band Wireless-N USB network adapter for Windows XP and 2000 systems.	1
5391	"After 3 hours on the phone with 3 different Linksys support people, I still cannot access the Internet via the Wireless-N USB network adapter."	0
5392	"It will connect with the WRT160N, but will not access the Internet."	0
5393	"Since my wife needs the connection, I put back the old equipment."	0
5394	The WRT160N installation CD gave me the error message Error 312 No wired adapter even though the adapter is there and works.	0
5395	Linksys support said there was a bug in the code.	0
5396	"When I did a manual install, the wired adapter worked."	1
5397	"Ive wasted at least 5 hours, and cannot make the Wireless-N adapter -- WRT160N connect with the Internet."	0
5398	"Finally, the Wireless-N adapter user interface is much worse, and slower, than the old WUSB11 ver."	0
5399	2.6.	0
5400	The only positive comment I have is that the wait for a support person was reasonable	1
5401	Cline (with 25 years of PC experience).	0
5402	After following installation instructions I got error 322 saying  new router or gateway Not Detected .	0
5403	I called customer support and he tried to convince me than there is a problem on my modem and for $ 10 they will fix it.	0
5404	I tried to explain him then I just paid already over $ 70 for the router in store and I am not going to spent any more money and I would like them to fix it free or I am going to return it.	1
5405	Hes answer was bla bla bla and I would have to pay or it wont work.	1
5406	"I said I am really not going to pay and he answered me to keep trying to run the installation cd, have a nice day and he hang up."	0
5407	"By the way it was already  evening, pacific time."	0
5408	"I just purchased the Linksys WRT160N Ultra RangePlus Wireless-N Broadband Router, so I cant give a review as far as long term performance but I can offer comments about the set-up - FAST and EASY."	1
5409	I connected one wired and two wireless computers in less time than it takes to boot up the three computers.	0
5410	One of the wireless computers is in the basement and other is a laptop that my son is using two rooms away from the router - and so far so good.	1
5411	Everything is up and running at speed.	1
5412	"its a good product ,easy to install,worth the money"	1
5413	had some problem with delivery of the product	0
5414	"resolved by amazon in a thoughtful manner,great job..................!!!!!"	1
5415	"I recently purchased this to set up an N router/adapter combo (instead of the Netgear G setup we had), on 1 Desktop and 2 Laptops in our home."	1
5416	"This was very easy to install, and the signal strength/speed has increased significantly (we are in a 1st floor apt, and had trouble getting adequate signals through the walls of an 1860 sq foot apt)."	1
5417	Excellent product-highly recommended!	1
5418	I thought this was going to be a quality product.	0
5419	It looks nice and is packaged well.	1
5420	I read reviews that said it was great so I bought it.	0
5421	I had it 3 days and it started to hang every day.	0
5422	"Today I called Linksys/Cisco tech support, and that was a journey to be sure."	1
5423	I know I selected English as the language I prefer yet the tech on the other end could not grasp what I was saying.	1
5424	"When I explained that the router was hanging, the nice, obviously clueless lady on the phone told me to just power cycle it when it hangs."	0
5425	The explanation was that there is nothing wrong with it if it can connect.	0
5426	I admittedly became a little heated and was dumped from the call with a case number and an offer to call back if I still had trouble	0
5427	Long and short the hardware might be just fine but the firmware is total garbage.	0
5428	Im returning this thing.	0
5429	I ordered this router through Amazon in an attempt to save money.	0
5430	I didnt want to purchase a new one as Im on a tight budget with a new born around and I also didnt want to pay the cable company to make my internet connection wireless (especially since I knew I could do it myself).	1
5431	It took forever to receive the product.	1
5432	"Other than that, it wasnt too difficult to set up."	0
5433	"It didnt come with any disks, manuals, wires, or instructions of any kind but I was still able to get it set up with no problem."	0
5434	The only complaint that I have regarding the router is that it randomly drops the connection to my Mac from time to time.	0
5435	Its not an every day thing but it is frustrating.	0
5436	"Other than that, it works fine and the range is great."	1
5437	WOW Cisco does not honor its warranty.	1
5438	I contacted Cisco through support chat as that was the only choice I could find on there web site.	1
5439	At first the representative said I was past the 90 day complimentary support.	1
5440	"I asked about the 1 year warranty, they said yes buy a new one."	0
5441	I still have 5 days left what is going on.	0
5442	Try another brand.	0
5443	Do not buy!!	1
5444	Very dissapointed.	0
5445	Going crazy just after 3 months!I have not expected cisco would supply this junk to its customers.	0
5446	"Purchased a used Linksys from here, the router arrived damaged in a bag not a box."	0
5447	it was all scrapped up like it was drug on the ground.	1
5448	"i plugged it in and nothing, not to mention the set up CD was not with the package....Very disapointed."	0
5449	now im waiting for a reply from them.	1
5450	i shall see what happens...	0
5451	I bought this router July 19 2011.	0
5452	Two issues.	0
5453	"First, the one I bought has already failed and needs replacing."	0
5454	"Second, I paid $49.95 in July."	1
5455	The same unit is now almost $100.00.	0
5456	all linksys products would work very good if you flash the firmware with ddwrt or tomatousbnever use the stock crap firmware!	0
5457	"I purchased this item and it came with a power supply, but not the OEM power supply."	0
5458	Some chinese version.	0
5459	The seller sent exactly this in the box: Non-working power supply & router (which also didnt work I found out later).	0
5460	Nothing else in the box.	0
5461	"In fact, the box it came in had my shipping label over another shipping label, which indicated that the device was shipped for repair or return, and it was re-sent to me directly."	0
5462	"Either way, When I went out and bought the correct power supply, the router was locked to some AT&T user and network."	0
5463	I successfully reset the router and got access via hard line cat5.	0
5464	"The router would connect to my ISP no problem, but it would randomly drop the connection."	0
5465	"Sometimes for 1 minute, sometimes for 5 minutes, sometimes for 10 times straight, sometimes only a couple."	0
5466	Its like the router was failing to resolve any DNS addresses.	0
5467	"I plugged my original router back in and all was good, then tried this one all was bad."	0
5468	I feel like I got duped by the seller and by Cisco..	1
5469	It was a WRT160Nv3 model for those interested	1
5470	I emailed to seller and he had no replacments but offered a refund if I paid shipping.	1
5471	*tsk*	0
5472	I purchased this router to replace a previous Linksys Wireless-G router that had gone on the fritz	0
5473	"While this new router looks sleek, I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of its performance."	0
5474	"The device definitely looks like it had gone the way of the cheap build of Netgear devices, and I worried that it would last as long as the router I was replacing (seems everything is getting disposable these days).Fortunately, my skepticism is wrong"	0
5475	This router has been a fantastic replacement only making me regret I didnt replace my old router sooner.	0
5476	"I worried a bit about its lack of antenna, but the range isthe same if not better when I look at it in G mode (all of my devices are G-mode devices) compared to the previous router."	0
5477	"Unfotunately, the power seems a little weaker, but not enough to really affect my use as I am on a 6MPBs Internet connection  that really isnt affected by my computerworking at a little less than its 54 MBPs rating."	0
5478	"Fortunately, I do get the full power for my streaming devices, which are probably most network intensive"	1
5479	The setup of the router is 1000 times better than what I remember with my previous device.	0
5480	"I remember having a hard time as the previous router required a wired computer, and my ISPs tricky method of sending an IP address that essentially matches the default most routers used made that old router take 8 hours to set-up and a lot of customer support calls, hacking, etc to change the address of the router (a Linksys flaw at that time).Fast forward a few years, and the device and its software essentially self-set itself without needing a direct computer connection."	0
5481	"The software Linksys provides is likely adequate for most home users, although limits the ability to customize things."	0
5482	"Fortunately, most customization can still be obtained by browsing directly to the router, and all of the typical cutomizable features (security, ports, etc) are there"	1
5483	The router has now run for nearly a year with only one drop-out.	0
5484	The only issue Ive had (and it isnt a bad one) is the firewall can sometimes throw a fit and not let one of my devices through when its on.	0
5485	"Apparently, that device when updated changes its signature enough that I need to open the firewall to let it in and then unblock its port before resetting the firewall."	1
5486	"This is a bit of a hassle that I cant really blame directly on the router or the device (probably a bit of both).Ultimately, I think this device is good enough for what it does."	0
5487	It is the middle of the road model that doesnt interfere with my phone lines and will likely last longer for me than its predecessor did.	0
5488	This is simply the worst piece of technical crap I have ever seen and used.	0
5489	I have latest revision 3 with the latest firmware preinstalled.	0
5490	"During the first week with one client I was getting constant connection drops and router restarts, so I changed it for another one of the same model."	0
5491	"And, guess, same thing."	0
5492	"I use Internet after work, so for 3-5 hours a day the router sometimes manages to restart 2-3 times and drop connection at least that many times."	0
5493	"For the last year I have changed the Internet provider (and the place I live), as well as I have experience all these issues with more than 5 laptops and few phones."	0
5494	There are two occasions when this junk is guaranteed to restart it:- One of the computers shuts down (both Vista and 8)- I use my DLNA remote control from the smartphone to connect to the TVWith both devices I have reflashed the firmware and reset them - same result.	0
5495	"Additionally, as later I understood, there are some serious problems in the design of this s***.P"	0
5496	Hitting Post I saw that the connection has been dropped again	0
5497	I thought dropping 75 on a router meant that at least I was getting the latest and greatest.	0
5498	It contantly drops connection and when I try to log back on it cant connect to the network.	0
5499	I reset it many times to try to fix it but no luck.	0
5500	I am resorting to hard wire connection cause wireless is like 56k.	0
5501	Dont buy this router its a waste of money.	0
5502	I was better of with my older wireless G router.	1
5503	This router did not solve my problem of receiving a signal from one end of the house to the other (about 60 feet).	0
5504	When I purchased this item I read the return policy of Amazon and was comfortable with their 15restocking fee for returns.	1
5505	"However, when I contacted them to return the item I was tersely told that they do not accept returns on this type of item."	0
5506	"In addition, they told me not to return without their authorization or it would be promptly returned to me."	1
5507	"I would strongly advise anyone considering a purchase of this item, or this type of item to go to Best Buy or Circuit City."	1
5508	You may have a better chance of returning the item.	0
5509	Amazon was simply unwilling to help me with this item.	0
5510	Ive had this a month now and its still running great!	1
5511	"I have my desktop pc and Xbox 360 hooked up through ethernet cables, and my laptop with a wireless N minicard."	1
5512	"I noticed the most difference on my xbox where i used to lose the signal every half hour and drop me from a game, now its faster and i never get dropped."	0
5513	My laptop works anywhere in the house with 5 bars of signal.	1
5514	I would definitely recommend this to a friend.	1
5515	"The only problem ive noticed, which isnt really a problem is the blue leds are so bright that they bacically act as a nightlight, so if this were in your bedroom it might be hard to sleep."	0
5516	"Its not in my room so its not really a problem for me, just thought i would mention it."	0
5517	"I actually got this at wal-mart for only $75, so i would recommend getting it there so you can easily return it if you have a problem."	0
5518	This router fixed a nagging problem I was facing with my WGT624 v2 Netgear router.	0
5519	All network pundits on the www opined about no relationship between a router and operating system (vista ultimate in my case).	0
5520	I continued to face excruciatingly slow connection when connected and most times local connection (no internet) with my old router	0
5521	I took a chance and replaced my Netgear router with this WRT160N and I now have a consistently fast connection (up to 5MBPS with cablevision) during downloads.	1
5522	The more secure encryption scheme that this router provides in place of wep of my legacy router is also a bonus	1
5523	"I had to reset all network devices (modem, router) and the desktop and some tweaking of the antenna on the desktop before the optimal connection could be obtained"	0
5524	Overall I am happy with this router and would recommend this.	1
5525	I bought this router to replace a Linksys G router because I could not get my wireless connection upstairs.	0
5526	"First, this product and the adaptor did not install correctly on my laptop."	1
5527	I had to pay an additional $10 for their tech to install it correctly.	1
5528	"After much hassle, the product does NOT expand range and I still cannot get a strong enough wireless connection upstairs."	1
5529	DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY if it is range you are looking to expand.	1
5530	"After reviewing several router options I have chosen the WRT160N as my new router, actually my main point was to use the DD-WRT firmware with it, partly following several reviews here below and from several forum"	0
5531	Once I received this router I tried to work with the CD provided but it had a problem to run	0
5532	"No problem, I had installed some routers in my life and this one didnt take more the 10min to install including wireless configurations"	0
5533	"immediately after installation I saw that I cant upgrade my firmware as this is WRT160Nv2 and it apparently uses Ralink CPU and not BROADCOM cpu - Ralink is not supported yet in open FW due to licensing :(In addition, it appears that there is degrading in memory capacity in the versions of the routers that goes by WRT160N!V1 - 32mbV1.1 - 16mbV2 - 8mbEven more annoying, Linksys do not have a web page for any version other than for v1!Although I didnt get the actual product I thought I am buying, I started using the wireless with my laptop while my desktop was connected to one of the LAN ports, the results:1) P2P software causes network disconnects (probably due to the fact linksys reduced the memory to 8MB only), I had to minimize the software configuration in order to stop the disconnects.2)Signal strength is ridiculous as it doesnt cover all my apartment which is not big."	0
5534	- Update: I got some configuration advise from Linksys support to improve the signle:Change the Beacon Interval to 50Change the Fragmentation Threshold to 2304.Change the RTS Threshold to 2304- It increased the signal strength...	1
5535	"I do not like this solution, as my apartment is small the defaults should have sufficed"	1
5536	I might return this product to Amazon and replace it with a different wireless router	1
5537	"Based on all other reviews, I am pretty sure that WRT160N V1 is a solid router (Good hardware & FW can be replaced) - if you order this one, make sure you dont get version 2 (at least until Linksys will have a webpage for it with new FW)"	1
5538	This is a good product.	1
5539	It works well and its easy to setup.	1
5540	"To steal a line from Geico, Its so easy, even a caveman could do it."	0
5541	lol  I also like the look of this router.	1
5542	Its sleek and unique.	1
5543	Ive had this router for a month now and its operation has been closeenough to advertised to keep me happy.	1
5544	The unit is located in thebasement of our 3000 sqft daylight ranch house and reception is at two orthree bars throughout our home.	1
5545	Thats with using G network notebookcomputers as we dont yet have any N devices.	0
5546	I would expect receptionto be even stronger with that standard.	1
5547	"At any rate, we can easily streammovies from upstairs at either end of the house"	0
5548	I was surprised at the flexibility of the router configuration optionsfor the price we paid.	1
5549	"If you are knowledgeable about such things asport forwarding, DMZ and optimizing for Bit Torrent or gaming, you willhave everything available to you thats needed"	1
5550	"We were not impressed with the included router desktop software, though"	0
5551	"It might be useful at times for troubleshooting or adding other wirelessdevices to the network, but for day to day operation its just not needed"	1
5552	"I recommend installing it, then disabling it from running at startup."	1
5553	Just use it when you think you need it	1
5554	"If you use the included installation wizard on the CD, keep in mindthat you may need to power your modem off and on to complete theconnection to the router."	0
5555	"If you get your local network up but haveno internet, try resetting your modem before pulling out all yourhair"	0
5556	"All in all, a pretty good product for the low price."	1
5557	If you would likefaster network speeds between your computers you might want to spenda bit more and get a router with Gigabit support through the wiredports.	1
5558	But we find transfer speeds to be acceptable here for this level of expenditure.	1
5559	I just replaced my D-link WB1310 router with this Linksys router.	0
5560	It is the second Linksys router I have purchased	1
5561	"It was soooooooooooo easy to install, took longer to load the CD than to figure out how to connect."	1
5562	We had all equipment up and running within one hour.	1
5563	The coverage in the house is excellent.	1
5564	"I was worried that I would need to purchase the N adaptor to make my laptop work, but it is configurable with B and G capability."	1
5565	All you have to do is follow the pictures and instructions on the CD.	1
5566	Nothing difficult	0
5567	I would highly recommend this router to anyone looking for ease of use and good value.	1
5568	Just got this to replace an older netgear b/g router that served us well	1
5569	Set-up was super easy [some mac reviewers complained about the wizard; linksys must have revamped their software].	0
5570	Configuration is also available via browser.	0
5571	"All CPUs on my network took easily to the new network, except one older legacy patchworked machine."	1
5572	Linksys has an excellent on-line knowledgebase which regrets did not solve the problem.	0
5573	I accessed their very user-friendly on-line chat.	1
5574	I was up and running in no time.	1
5575	The problem was [thankfully] operator error	0
5576	Great customer service.	1
5577	Using this router on my b/g network may be like using Hi-test gas in a car designed to run on regular [ie:overkill w/o much return].	0
5578	But the price differential between a basic or MIMO b/g and this great deal was worth the upgrade.	1
5579	And our network is only going to be generating greater demand as we move forward.	0
5580	This router will [hopefully] keep us going for a few years to come.	0
5581	Followed instructions on the CD to the letter... the router wouldnt connect.	0
5582	I called Linksys Customer Service... Sahim finally said he couldnt help me.	0
5583	I then called my ISP Tech Support and they had me humming in 90 seconds.	0
5584	So far I like the router.	1
5585	Linksys Customer Service is a joke though.	0
5586	Call your ISP first.	0
5587	What can I say?	1
5588	Excellent product and the easiest wireless setup I have ever had.	1
5589	Turned on the laptop after the setup and voila!	0
5590	there it was	0
5591	Highly recommend this for anyone as lazy as I am....just follow the directions on the EZ setup and you cant go wrong.	0
5592	Bought this product because last router had to constantly be reset.	0
5593	I hated uplugging it and waiting a half minute and then plugging it back in.	0
5594	"It was a daily thing, by the way that was a lynksys WRT54G."	0
5595	Have had this sleek machine for about a month and have not had to reset once	1
5596	Was weary of the range but it works really well.	1
5597	Im going through a total of 4 walls right now about 50ft away and im connected at 91	1
5598	"When i installed program i had a hard time, took about an hour, thats not to bad though"	0
5599	Im very happy with product so far and will update if any problems arise.	0
5600	Bought this router to replace an old Linksys wireless G adapter and set it up with the identical passwords and permissions and could not utilize file and printer sharing on ANY of my computers after that.	0
5601	Sometimes couldnt even see the other computers on the network.	0
5602	Called tech support and they were rude and not very knowledgable beyond basic set-up and told me that it was a windows problem and not a router problem.	0
5603	Explained SEVERAL times that it had all been set up properly and working on the old router.	0
5604	Couldnt even ping the other computers on the network.	0
5605	They finally told me to return it to the store just to prove to you that it isnt the router.	0
5606	so I did and re-installed my old G router.	0
5607	Wonder of wonders all of the file and printer sharing miraculously started working again.	1
5608	Imagine that.	1
5609	I am going to source another brand of router for my replacement.	0
5610	"Looks cool, setup is simple, and works like a charm."	1
5611	What else can I say?	1
5612	"When I originally started looking for routers, I needed one that would send a clear signal across my house (I have 5 bedrooms)."	1
5613	I had planned to hook up multiple laptops and an Xbox 360 to my network.	1
5614	"I was looking for range, security, durability, ease of use and a clear signal all the time."	1
5615	"I did a lot of research among different brands and models, but kept coming back to Linksys"	0
5616	"Luckily, I have not been disappointed in the Linksys WRT160N Ultra RangePlus Wireless N router."	0
5617	It has given me everything I was looking for going in.	1
5618	Setup was a breeze with the help of the instructions and installation CD.	0
5619	Encrypting my network was incredibly simple and my coverage has been excellent.	1
5620	"And I love the design, since there are no wireless antennas."	1
5621	It looks sleek and stylish on my shelf	1
5622	I highly recommend this product!	1
5623	"Should you purchase this router, you wont be disappointed."	0
5624	this router is a real beauty!!!	1
5625	it can hang on the wall and add to your interior deco while giving you awesome wireless link speed.	0
5626	i have been using it for over 2 months and i dont have a single complaints.	0
5627	it works perfect with my WUSB600N attached to my desktop.	1
5628	the signal remains strong at over 200Mbps through concrete walls with my WUSB600N	1
5629	i use it to connect my devices wired or wirelessly based on my mood	0
5630	WinXP desktop (connects wired or wireless)Xbox360 (connects wired or wireless)linksys WVC54GC internet camera (connects wired or wireless)WUSB600N wireless adapter (connects wireless)D-link 10/100 fast ethernet switch (connects wired)its a really fine piece of computer hardware to have	1
5631	Best Buy recommended this router to me.	1
5632	Assembled everything as instructed and suddenly NO INTERNET on any of my laptops (Toshiba) or desktop (Dell)!	0
5633	"After 45 min on the phone with someone call Summer who spoke D+ English, nothing had been accomplished."	1
5634	Took it back for an exchange...DLink works just fine.	1
5635	"This model has high visual appeal, so I was hugely disappointed when I couldnt connect to configure mine."	0
5636	Id get another of the same except that my NIC (the laptops network card) no longer worked when I unplugged it from the router.	1
5637	"It may be sheer co-incidence that it worked 2 minutes before I connected it to this router, and was damaged when I disconnected the router, but I dont want to take that chance, so Im staying away from this product for now."	0
5638	"btw, Ive set up a couple other routers in the past, and didnt have problems with them."	0
5639	Ive had this wireless router for about a month.	0
5640	Easy to set up and basically no maintenance.	1
5641	"I got this to enable wi-fi for my new iPhone 3G and after installing the router and configuring with the simple set-up software, Safari web browsing, Youtube videos, e-mail, etc."	0
5642	all work as advertised.	1
5643	There have been a several episodes where the iPhone couldnt connect.	0
5644	One particularly frustrating episode was cleared up when I realized that the iPhones e-mail application got stuck in trying to open the wireless connection and would only release by terminating the iPhones app - I had to do some digging to learn that the iPhone has like a ctrl-alt-del feature which you do by holding the home button down for like 6-10 seconds.	1
5645	I havent had this happen again since but the were a couple of times when I couldnt immediately open the wireless connection but I think its more the iPhones software thats not quite perfect and in any event I did eventually connect and by and large its now reliable.	1
5646	I think the router is just fine and the coverage excellent - my next door neighbor claims having no trouble connecting to it	1
5647	Update 10/21/2011: I ended up having so many problems with this router either not establishing or failing to maintain connections with my iPhone that it wound up in pieces at the base of the nearest wall.	0
5648	I  then bought the much less expensive and the much simpler to set up and maintain Belkin Wireless N router.	0
5649	"Wow, what a pleasure to just plug a thing in, spend moments to set up and then just forget that you even have a device that just does what its supposed to reliably."	1
5650	Hats ff to Belkin for showing me what crap Cisco passed off as technology for the home user.	0
5651	Been using this for little over 2 months now.	0
5652	Got it as a replacement to older Netgear wireless G router.	0
5653	"Set up was easy, range is much better than my previous router."	1
5654	"Overall, was hoping for better coverage though."	1
5655	"I have 2 laptops, both apple (powerbook and macbook)."	1
5656	Live in 2 story house with the office in first floor corner which is where this unit is located.	1
5657	"Signal if okay for the most part, but it does not cover the far end of the house very well._____________This is update to the review."	1
5658	Ive had this since Sept 2008.	0
5659	It works okay for the most part but sometimes my Mac laptops just cannot seem to pick up any signal.	1
5660	I dont know if its the router or the laptops but the signal sometimes cannot be picked up for some reason.	0
5661	It has nothing to do with location since I use the laptop on same location for the most part.	0
5662	"Since I did not have this problem with my old router, Im probably gonna get a different router soon."	0
5663	"I recently purchased a laptop with wireless capability and needed to buy a wireless router that had both wired and wireless capability to replace our old router running our wired network at home (two pcs, one mac desktop and one macbook pro)."	1
5664	I purchased the Linksys WRT160N Ultra RangePlus Wireless-N Broadband Router based on the reviews I read on Amazon.	1
5665	It has exceeded my expectations in every way	1
5666	First it was stupidly simple to install.	0
5667	I followed the instructions on the cd and that was almost it.	0
5668	The software installs on only one of the computers (a big timesaver).	0
5669	The only hiccup in the process was that I needed to reboot the modem once the router was in place so the computers could access a new IP address and the instructions on the router cd do not address that issue (and maybe they cant due to varying hardware requirements).	0
5670	"The entire process took me about an hour, including a phone call to my internet provider to clear up the reboot issue"	0
5671	"I am now happily working from my new laptop, sitting in my SkyChair in the backyard under the apple tree."	1
5672	It is my new office.	1
5673	"Connection speed is fast, even with the router in the basement and the laptop outside."	1
5674	"I look forward to enjoying warm autumn days working without walls, enjoying the sunshine while it lasts."	1
5675	Received product as requested.	0
5676	"Have had problems with connection, but not sure at this point if it is the wireless router, vonage or comcast."	0
5677	Router does allow faster connection to things such as printers.	1
5678	Product used for College and Linksys has a great customer service staff if you have a problem with installaion.	0
5679	"I followed the step-by-Step installation program, but the installation, however, had a serious outcome with my network--none of my three computers can communicate within the network."	0
5680	The installation somehow reconfigured my home network (MSHOME) and I cant get it reconfigured.	0
5681	which defeats the purpose of having a home network.	1
5682	This is serious.	0
5683	"I contacted Linksys, who stated they only provide help for internet connectivity issues, not networking."	0
5684	I spoke with two techs who said they couldnt help with networking and that I should contact Microsoft.	0
5685	"Past experience with Linksys was outstanding, but their service this time was poor"	0
5686	The range is only slightly better than my WRT54G Wireless G router.	1
5687	Dont expect any real improvement over a wireless G connection.	0
5688	"I moved an additional 10 feet and one wall away, and I was out of range."	0
5689	"I bought it to increase range, since my network is all G speed rated."	1
5690	"Jeez, I had no idea this would be so much worse than my 4 year old N-router (which had the antenna broken recently by my cat!"	0
5691	I used to have 4-bars on Windows Vista.. Now I have One and keep having to connect to to rejoin the network.	0
5692	"Unlike some other reviews here, my experience was not favorable."	0
5693	"I was only able to get it work with 2 of our 5 home office computers, even when used with supposedly matching Linksys draft N adaptors."	1
5694	Wasted most of a day trying different suggestions from Linksys web site - which was basically a listing of users helping users!	0
5695	Ive been setting up my own networks for many years and this was one of the most frustrating products Ive tried.	0
5696	I returned this router and went back to an old reliable (5 years+) Linksys access point connected to a wired Vonage router.	0
5697	Ive had this router running for about a month.	0
5698	It works great.	1
5699	I have it hard-wired to two computers that sit next to each other.	0
5700	I use wireless with my new iphone	0
5701	I had no problems setting it up and it works wonderfully.	1
5702	I live in a condo and can even get my wireless signal via iphone while standing outside the building	0
5703	"If you get a wireless router, make sure you secure the network with a passcode."	1
5704	"While walking my dog around my condo complex, I see all kinds of unsecured wireless routers available to my phone."	0
5705	The farther away you are are higher your speed....if you dont believe it try these routers.	1
5706	Otherwise great router no problem with installation.	0
5707	I have read reviews about people having difficult time with installation and most of them are mac users.	0
5708	And its a better deal than buying a gigabit router which are good if you have extra cash to throw away.	0
5709	I bought this product and hooked it up with no issues whatsoever.	0
5710	Nice looking and no antenna sticking out/up.	1
5711	The security piece is great and all PCs in my house have no trouble getting connected and staying connected securely.	1
5712	"I gave this 4 stars because every once in a while it disconnects, which happened more often on the last 3 routers Ive owned."	0
5713	Would definitely recommend this product to anyone in the market for wireless N.	1
5714	"I bought this for replacing an older Linksys WRT54GL, which has trouble to reach a room at the other corner in my house."	0
5715	"I have a Windows laptop, a Macbook pro, a linux desktop, and iPhone."	0
5716	All of them are happily connected with this new router from any location in my house without any problem	0
5717	"One thing I would like to mention:  During the initial setup, wizard does not work -- I suspect it is because my ATT DSL router uses 192.168.1.1 and by default the linksys router tries to use the same network for LAN."	0
5718	"After I changed it to 192.168.10.1 for LAN on the linksys router (as I did for my older WRT54GL), now the wireless network works fine."	0
5719	"This router works extremely well, and was incredibly easy to set up."	1
5720	"I had no problems whatsoever with the setup, and the setup CD worked very well."	0
5721	"I could have set up the router without it, but I wanted to see what the CD would do."	0
5722	"No installation of software, just set up the router."	0
5723	Running great so far with my MacBook Pro.	1
5724	Our business building has 8 offices on 2 floors (metal-studs construction in all partition walls).	1
5725	"Since we experienced some difficulties in receiving wireless phone (including cell phone) signal in some area inside the building, we were very concerned about using a wireless network."	0
5726	"But amazingly, this small Ultra Range Plus can work nicely to transfer strong signals wirelessly across all offices.."	1
5727	I have to start this review by admitting this router wasnt my first choice.	1
5728	"After struggling with an old 802.11B router for a while, I decided it was time for an upgrade and went shopping."	0
5729	"After a great deal of time and research, I settled on the Belkin F5D8233-4 N Wireless Router, an inexpensive Draft-N solution that got good reviews"	1
5730	It worked well -- for about a month.	1
5731	"Then, the router and my MacBook decided they were no longer going to play nice."	0
5732	"My connection would drop every ten seconds, and sometimes it would fail to reconnect for hours on end."	0
5733	"The Belkin, I decided, must be destroyed."	0
5734	"I read the reviews on this Linksys model, and decided to go with it instead"	0
5735	"Thankfully, this solved the problem with my MacBook."	0
5736	"Indeed, I have that laptop and another MacBook Pro hooked up to the Linksys, both without a single connection issue."	0
5737	"Other items on the network are a desktop PC, a multi-function printer, a VOIP line, two iPhones, and a Tivo."	1
5738	All have behaved well.	1
5739	"Better yet, the frequent power blinks we get here dont seem to phase the router -- after a brief power cycle, it gets back on its feet quickly"	1
5740	"The range appears to be quite good, but I have to admit that my duplex isnt exactly cavernous."	1
5741	"Nonetheless, Ive taken the MacBook and the iPhone well into the backyard, putting some distance and a couple of brick walls between the devices and the router, and have experienced no loss of coverage"	0
5742	"Speed, unfortunately, is the only spot where Ive been less than enthused."	0
5743	"Dont get me wrong -- its pretty quick, especially if youre accustomed to an 802.11B connection."	0
5744	"However, the Belkin I first tried put this Linksys to shame."	0
5745	"Well, when it worked, at least."	1
5746	"It was blazing fast, and I found myself a little disappointed at being slowed down."	0
5747	"I havent done any official tests for this, however."	0
5748	"Moreover, the Linksys is plenty fast, and Im a relatively high-demand user, much to my ISPs chagrin"	1
5749	"Setup is easy and, if its important to you, this router is one of the most attractive on the market."	1
5750	"Better yet, I didnt have any MAC address issues like Ive had in the past with other routers (that is, Belkin)."	0
5751	"Within 10 minutes, I was up and running, cursing Belkin and praising Linksys the whole time"	1
5752	"All together, this router is a solid purchase."	1
5753	"Reliability has been wonderful, and I can live with slightly decreased performance."	1
5754	"If youre a highly wired weirdo like me, dont hesitate to buy!"	1
5755	"I have been looking for a wireless-N router to replace my old Linksys wireless-G router for a while, and I saw this one, decided to give it a try (was thinking switch to D-link)."	0
5756	"This router looks great and also works great, the wifi signal is reliable and stable and a lot faster than my old Linksys router, thanks to the Wireless-N, it also makes the LAN faster than before, so far I am very pleased with the router, and would recommend this product."	1
5757	I was really excited to get this product as I thought it would speed up my network overall for legacy G devices while allowing my new laptop with the N adapter to use.	1
5758	"Sadly, I was extremely disappointed by the performance."	0
5759	"My old laptop, with a G adapter, immediately dropped link speed to 36 Mbps from 48 Mbps."	0
5760	It doesnt bother me from an internet access point of view (as Comcast tops out at about 6 Mbps on average) but I have a network hard drive for which I would like to maximize the speed	0
5761	"Even worse, after I had configured the Intel 4965 N adapter on my new laptop (btw you have to ensure the WRT160N is using WPA2 security with AES for the Intel Adapter to work in N mode!"	0
5762	", I found that the maximum bandwidth possible was 130 Mbps and invariably, it was less than that - more like 78 Mbps."	1
5763	The reason for that is apparently the N routers need to use both the 5.4 Ghz and 2.4 Ghz frequencies to provide speeds of 270 Mbps	0
5764	"Yet even worse, for some reason the internet download speed through Comcast was far lesser - about 800 Kbps."	0
5765	"If I disable the N mode on the laptop or the WRT160N, I got my original download speed of 6 Mbps but that was just not acceptable."	0
5766	I tried a variety of options but could never find a right combination.	1
5767	Others have stated that phones and other devices like microwaves might cause interference available but the funny thing is my phones are at 5.8 Ghz and the microwave is downstairs and far away and hardly in use	0
5768	"The device does look good and fits with the furniture a lot better, but I think I will wait for a more solid device with compatibility issues ironed out and cheaper N adapters available for legacy laptops/devices."	1
5769	Well well.	1
5770	Never thought Id actually say this about Linksys but I have to admit this router is absolute trash out of the box.	0
5771	I dont know what happened.	0
5772	"Linksys used to be a very good company with quality products but, as everyone else has already pointed out, they cant program their new routers for the life of them."	0
5773	So heres what happened:I recently went on a vacation to visit my dad for a few weeks.	0
5774	"Knowing he didnt have wireless, I took my old router with me."	0
5775	After I returned home I realized I left my old router at my dads place.	0
5776	"No big deal I thought, I had been thinking about investing in a new router for quite some time and had been aching to see what kind of speeds Id get with a Wireless-N connection."	0
5777	After much research I decided to get this.	0
5778	Even after reading all the reviews on Amazon I decided to trust Linksys since theyd never let me down before	0
5779	Got the router.	0
5780	Plugged it in.	1
5781	Was very surprised that it required no setup!	0
5782	It detected my internet connection right away and my LAN started working even before I was half-way done through the Linksys setup CD.	0
5783	I was liking it already.	1
5784	Thats when the problems started.	0
5785	"When I got to Step 4, the Linksys setup could NOT find their own router attached to my computer!"	0
5786	I would always get the same message: Please check all cables are connected correctly and try again.	0
5787	Since I was connected to the Internet I didnt pay it any more mind and cancelled the Linksys setup	0
5788	I decided to setup Wireless next and went into the Router config page.	0
5789	Linksys has a nifty button on the router itself to guide you through Wi-Fi Protected setup and I decided to give it a whiz just for the heck of it.	0
5790	Followed instructions and waited 5+ minutes and the Wi-Fi protected setup tells me it cannot find the Router!	0
5791	"When I accessed it from the router CONFIG page that I went to after going through the ROUTER itself even though I can access the Internet fine...Well, that aside, I setup the Wireless manually and sure enough it connects immediately."	1
5792	I get blazing fast speeds as though Im connected directly through the ethernet.....for about 2 minutes.	1
5793	Then its all over.	0
5794	"I check the connection: Sure enough, connected through Wireless-N at 130 Mbps and the speed test says Im getting a measly 350 kbps downloads on a 6 Mbit connection."	0
5795	I try everything possible and finally give up after a week after consistently getting a fluctuating wireless connection jumping between 0.5 - 1 mbps with having to reset the router at least twice a day because of connection drops	0
5796	I decided to return the router.	0
5797	Thats when I find DD-WRT thanks to a written review on Amazon.	1
5798	I am ecstatic now.	1
5799	Ever since I have installed DD-WRT this Router has been performing so brilliantly its absolute bliss.	1
5800	I am now connected through Wireless-N and am consistently connected at 5.5 Mbps and have yet to do a Reset because of a connection drop	0
5801	"I have decided to keep the router since its given me the faster wireless Internet I could possibly want, after putting custom firmware on it of-course....It just could be that I had a defective product but the number of bad reviews on Amazon leads me to believe otherwise."	0
5802	"Its a shame that the hardware on this excellent product is so phenomenal yet the consistent bad programming at Linksys renders it absolutely useless...Im giving this product a One Star, because you shouldnt need to essentially hack a product to get it to perform what it is supposed to be doing out of the box."	0
5803	"You may have better luck with it, I didnt."	1
5804	I had to be frustrated out of my mind for a week and think Linksys...this is a Linksys product!Closing Remarks: This Router has by far the greatest piece of hardware I have ever had.	0
5805	If it works that is.	1
5806	"My advice is, buy it and then just put DD-WRT on it right away."	0
5807	Pulled it right out of the box and it worked great.	1
5808	"I had Comcast installed that afternoon, hooked the router right up and did the normal setup and did not have one problem"	0
5809	The router seems to have a problem with the WMP300N network card but I will put the review on that side.	0
5810	All three of my laptops get 5 bars and great speeds so I am placing the blame on the desktop card.	0
5811	I bought this at best buy because it was the same price as amazon ($69.99) and I didnt want to wait for shipping.	1
5812	"Setup was a breeze with my macbook, its the usual router setup with a disc...no problems at all."	0
5813	"The range of this sucker is great, I get a high signal any place in my house."	1
5814	"It also is very small, light, and looks sleek"	1
5815	Great product for the price.	1
5816	The only thing I wished it had was usb support so I could hook up my harddrives full of movies.	1
5817	"But, I can just hook them up to my desktop and stream through the network anyway, so not a big deal"	1
5818	"EDIT:  After 1 year of use, I now get total crap for range!"	0
5819	I can only get a good signal if im right up next to the damn thing.	1
5820	What a POS!	0
5821	Bought this product and have had no poblems with it.	0
5822	I am not super techy and I just needed it to use my new laptop around my house.	0
5823	I get internet connection upstairs and downstairs.	0
5824	I had a small problem  at upstart but a quick call to support and they walked me through rather quickly.	0
5825	Very pleased with this product.	1
5826	The Ultra RangePlus wireless-N Router is a very high quality product.	1
5827	Vastly increased speeds over Wireless-G Routers due to the dual band transmissions with the N router.	0
5828	Increased range and penetration through interior structures and to outside porches and patios.	0
5829	I purchased this router recently.	1
5830	It was very easy to install and works wonderfully.	1
5831	I upgraded from a Linksys WRT54g ver 1.0 router in order to get more range (as I had heard that wireless N provided this even with G adapters).	0
5832	I was very disappointed	0
5833	"The installation process was fine (assuming you know Linksys), although their software configuration tool crashed repeatedly."	0
5834	I got the router working with no problems	0
5835	Then I noticed the range was much worse on this router.	0
5836	I conducted my own tests using my internal Intel Wireless G adapter on my Dell Inspiron laptop.	0
5837	I conducted the tests with WirelssMon software program.	0
5838	"I positioned the routers in the exact same spot each time, and the laptop was also in the exact same place each test."	0
5839	"Here are my results of my signal strength testing:Basement (right next to the router):Wireless N (20 MHz): -40 dB = 67Wireless N (40 MHz): -32 dB = 75Wireless N (auto): -37 dB = 70WRT54G: -29 dB = 79Main floor (one floor above router):Wireless N (20 MHz): -53 dB = 51Wireless N (40 MHz): -55 dB = 51Wireless N (auto): -54 dB = 50WRT54G: -44 dB = 62ront Porch (one floor above router, a bit farther):Wireless N (20 MHz): -86 dB = 16Wireless N (40 MHz): not conductedWireless N (auto): not conductedWRT54G: -71 dB = 32Main bedroom (two floors above router):Wireless N (20 MHz): -74 dB = 27Wireless N (40 MHz): -72 dB = 30Wireless N (auto): -71 dB = 32WRT54G: -65 dB = 39learly there is a benefit to the WRT54G (by about 5-10) in terms of signal strength."	1
5840	I have returned this router.	0
5841	"I might try another Linksys with a stronger antenna (?WRT610N), but I was very disappointed with the performance of this router."	0
5842	I previously used a Linksys wireless G router which was pretty good but after many years I think heat got to it and it became flaky so I tried this one	0
5843	I seem to get much better signal strength from the same distance and through several walls (two of them stucco-based).	1
5844	Ive not tried further distance yet or more barriers	0
5845	Management interface is very similar to the old version which made configuring very easy.	1
5846	"One difference is, it seems much easier to get encryption working than I recall for my previous router."	1
5847	Not sure what the difference was but this time took me about 60 seconds	0
5848	Id recommend this product for sure if youre replacing an older model or if you do a lot of file transfers between computers in your location.	1
5849	"Easy to install, good range - full strength in the backyard - and looks good."	1
5850	I ran this as N-Only and compared its performance and range to my existing WRT54GX2.	1
5851	For reference I am running Vista64 and use a Belkin N adapter (F5D8053).	1
5852	"I am spanning a distance of three floors and about 80 feet horizontally with lots of obstructions (walls, windows, doors, etc).Range was significantly less than my older router, went from Fair/Good (2-3 bars) to Poor (1 bar) with frequent timeouts to the router."	1
5853	I assume the internal antennas in the WRT160N are not as capable as the external antennas on the WRT54.Performance was dramatically diminished.	1
5854	I clocked performance on SpeakEasy bandwidth tester.	1
5855	Direct (wired) connect to cable modem was 20+ MBPS.	0
5856	WRT54GX2 (wireless G) clocked at 9.8MBPS.	1
5857	WRT160N (wireless N) clocked at 2.8MPS.	1
5858	Obviously this is due to the poor range	0
5859	"If you are looking to traverse a long distance with lots of obstacles, this not the router for you."	0
5860	"I needed a wireless router asap, so I went to wal-mart (sorry amazon) and this is all they had."	0
5861	"I knew linksys quality has gone down the tubes over the years, and i hesitated to buy this."	0
5862	"However, I needed a router that very day though so this was the only choice"	0
5863	"Ive set up many wireless networks in the past for friends and family (mostly using early WRT54Gs, which were great pre v5) however Ive never personally used a wirless network in my own home so I wasnt quite sure what to expect performance wise."	0
5864	Setup was easy as always using the web interface.	0
5865	I was excited to see my computer connect at 100+ Mbit from down the hall.	1
5866	However that was short lived as I soon realized I was actually getting barely 20Mbit...Well.. the horror stories are true.	1
5867	Linksys really cannot program for the newer routers very well at all.	1
5868	"It worked great for the first few days, however when I went to copy some very large files between my computer (on wireless) and the computer in the office (on wired LAN) it would fail randomly as my computer started disconnecting and reconnecting randomly."	0
5869	These files were about 5GB and over the paltry ~20Mbit connection it was painfully slow and I almost cried when it failed at about 80I tried many settings.	0
5870	"I had been using WPA2 and SSL for setup, and I thought maybe that was just too much for this thing to handle."	0
5871	However no amount of fiddling would solidify the connection.	0
5872	"The most stable settings were to use G-Only, 20Mhz band, and no encryption, but that was just unacceptable to me for such an expensive device."	0
5873	Also the device becomes fairly hot during heavy use	1
5874	THEN I DISCOVERED DD-WRT.	0
5875	HOORAY!	1
5876	I didnt think you could put custom firmware on newer linksys devices (its been a while since Ive set up a network).	0
5877	Man am I glad DD-WRT exists.	1
5878	"I now have a rock solid device, consistently get 1ms pings from anywhere in the house, and havent dropped a connection yet."	1
5879	"Not to mention I can now use VPN, UPnP, advanced QoS, etc etc.. Upping the transmitter power to 70mv (from the default 28!"	1
5880	now gets me a signal almost a block and a half away!	0
5881	"Now if i could just get up the Tx power on my usb adapter and iphone.. :)Not only that, but the thing runs cooler now even with the more than 2x power put into the antenna on the new firmware"	1
5882	"A note about speeds: First, I am using a WUSB100 adapter."	0
5883	As I said with the stock firmware I would get about 20mbit from my bedroom to the office.	0
5884	I have no doors in my house so there is almost a line of sight between the two devices.	1
5885	The WUSB100 would always report about 135Mbit (yeah right lol!).	1
5886	This was with a 40Mhz channel in mixed mode.	0
5887	Now with DD-WRT I get about 30Mbit and its rock solid stable.	1
5888	The WUSB100 now reports I connect at 65Mbit.. Not too bad I guess.	0
5889	"However there is no support in DD-WRT for wide channel on this device, I would be curious to see what performance would be with that enabled if it were possible."	0
5890	"Also I am using SSL for the web interface and WPA2 again, and the CPU load on the router barely goes above 20 222532972n most cases"	0
5891	So I give this hardware 5 stars.	0
5892	However Im rating it a 1 star because out of the box this thing is basically an expensive paperweight.	0
5893	Plus you have to know what your doing and risk bricking the thing to get it to perform as advertised	0
5894	Also note that I am a VERY heavy network user.	0
5895	"I use a lot of P2P, video streaming (to xbox on the LAN), copying massive files around, full HD backups, etc."	0
5896	My problems may not be the case for the average home user.	0
5897	I originally bought this product at Frys.	1
5898	"Then I shopped here on Amazon for the same product and it was 10 bucks cheaper--no tax, no shipping fee!"	1
5899	What a deal!	0
5900	"Anyway, when it was delivered, the router was easy to set up, like all LinkSys routers."	1
5901	"Its not too big, and its very pretty."	0
5902	It even has an option to hang up the wall to not take up space.	0
5903	"Since it is an N router, the range that this router has is pretty big."	1
5904	"I give it four stars, though, and not five, is because the range this N router compared to the other LinkSys N router is still smaller and weaker than the others."	0
5905	"It has several options where you can wifi with other things (without putting in the password) such as DS, Wii by pushing a button on the router and setting up the wifi on your item that requires the wifi."	1
5906	"=)  Anyway, I think this router is very easy to use and its great!"	1
5907	just the range needs a little bit more push...	0
5908	"I purchased this router with the sole intent of having a router that would not require me to constantly reboot it to reacquire a signal for the wireless machines in my home to work, or to gain new ip addresses."	1
5909	Ive been pleasantly surprised with this router.	1
5910	Ive had 2 other Linksys routers in the past (including Linksys srx200) and this one trumps all.	0
5911	"For the last 3 months, barring power outages in my area, I have not dropped a single connection and have not been required to reboot the machine."	0
5912	"Additionally, I have port fowarding set on this router, and this router handles the traffic very well."	1
5913	"According to the directions, you put the CD in BEFORE you do ANYTHING, which is what I did."	0
5914	"This thing literally was installed, hooked up and running in mere minutes!"	1
5915	Its awesome!	1
5916	Im in my living room typing on my laptop right now.	1
5917	I have never had the need for a wireless router of any kind until now so I have no experience apart from today with this sort of thing.	0
5918	"I highly recommend this on all counts...easy to install, easy to set up, easy to use, works great!"	1
5919	I like this product a lot better then the earlier one.	1
5920	I did need help in getting it up and running right when it says it is easy to get going.	1
5921	WRT160N has everything a router should have and anything complicated automated.	0
5922	"I am not a professional IT technician, but found this product EXTREMELY easy to be installed by the home user like me."	1
5923	"I was able set up this router with restricted access for items on MAC list only and reserved IP addresses for my home computer and devices (one wireless laptop, a network printer and a hard wired desktop) - in less than an hour, no sweat!However, the only downside: it does run a little bit too hot; therefore the one star off."	0
5924	"I brought a new Links wireless WRT160N from Walmart; sorry Amazon, router and have been trying to get it to work for the last 2 days; but it wouldnt connect, whatever I did."	0
5925	"Finally, out of desperation,  I switched over to Firefox and EVERYTHING started working!!!!"	0
5926	"My probelm all along had not been the new router or Network preferences, but SAFARI!!!"	0
5927	It was screwing things up.	0
5928	"I would recommend that if you are upgrading to a new N router, stay away from Safari and use Firefox, to access your 192.168.1.1 Linksys page."	0
5929	Webpages load super fastand everything is allot smoother.	1
5930	Im switching over to Firefox	0
5931	"I dont know what it is about Safari, but Linksys wireless router, definitely do not like it."	0
5932	"I purchased this product for better range in the house, since the router is in my office on the second floor, the laptop is on the main floor and my sons Xbox is in the basement."	1
5933	"I immediately got better range than my previous Linksys G router, but could not get the Xbox live to have an open NAT for full use of the Xbox Live feature (it only gave him moderate)."	1
5934	"After going to Xbox Live the Guide, I did the port forwarding, and now it is working great!!"	1
5935	"It may not be one of the approved routers for the Xbox, but I really wanted an N for the better range."	1
5936	"One tweak, and now its working great for for the Xbox and the laptop."	1
5937	"Easy to use, excellent signal."	1
5938	Have had no problems connecting to all my wireless devices.	0
5939	So I read how easy it was to install the Linksys WRT160N.	0
5940	"Not so, for me"	0
5941	"If you have Zone Alarm Pro, you may want to dump it, and get another firewall."	0
5942	"Thats what I did, after many hours of fighting with this thing"	1
5943	I am running XP with a DSL modem if that helps	0
5944	"The router itself, seems very nice and fast, although one thing you may want to consider is that it seems to run a little hot, and has vents on the underside"	1
5945	"All is running well since I dumped Zone Alarm, but I will downgrade my assessment if I get any more problems"	0
5946	UPDATE.	0
5947	1 Star	0
5948	"Perhaps its just me, but this thing worked great for a while, then stopped."	1
5949	"Worked great again, then stopped."	1
5950	I finally got tired of it	0
5951	I have a DLINK DIR655 N now.	0
5952	The menu and options are better too!	1
5953	"Sorry Linksys, I was a loyal customer up until now!"	0
5954	I have this router installed in our basement office.	1
5955	"I have set up a lot of equipment and normally bypass the installation disks that come with routers, but this disk was dead easy to use and had my network up and running quickly."	0
5956	Just make sure to shut down any firewall you may have running until you have finished the install disk.	1
5957	"Speed and coverage are great, and I am able to watch Netflix streaming movies and our slingbox with no lag up in our bedroom on the second floor."	1
5958	"As far as complaints with laptops dropping the connection, I went into the options on the router and gave my laptop a permanent ip address."	0
5959	Simply type the routers ip address into your browsers address bar.	0
5960	This will bring up a much more thorough interface to configure the router.	0
5961	The help manual on the included setup disk can give step by step instructions on how to do this for those that are not sure.	0
5962	"Once at the web based router setup, on the first page that comes up, simply click DHCP reservation in the center of the page."	0
5963	You will see devices that are currently connected to your router.	1
5964	Simply check the box next to your laptop and choose add client.	1
5965	Now you have given your laptop a permanent reserved ip address.	0
5966	This stopped my laptop from dropping its connection.	0
5967	"We are running an xbox 360, two laptops, two hard wired computers, one gaming adaptor, a Wii, one slingbox, and a old wireless b palm pilot with no connection drops or lag time."	0
5968	Highly recommend this router.	1
5969	"This router really fulfilled my expectations, the signal is always very strong throughout my apt."	1
5970	I could transfer large files between two laptops having n-wireless cards at over 5MB/s.	1
5971	Configuration is easy and the design is beautiful.	1
5972	I bought this to replace an older Linksys wireless-G router that got hit by lightning.	0
5973	"It was simple to set up, and works very well."	1
5974	Access by wireless is noticeably faster than the G version I had.	1
5975	"I have had several brands over the years, and Linksys (a division of Cisco) always seems to work well right out of the box."	1
5976	"The range is also better than the older G version, we consistently get 1-2 bars more than the older version on all 3 of our PCs that are connected wirelessly"	1
5977	This router works great with the Linksys USB wireless card (WUSB600N) for the remote computers	1
5978	"Highly recommended, and the price is right too!"	1
5979	Difficulty with installation.	0
5980	Had to call Linksys.	0
5981	But once up and running it was excellent and has been excellent.	1
5982	I would definitely recommend this wireless router.. easy to setup and super fast.	1
5983	The range is great too..	1
5984	I clocked some record speeds with this good looking piece of tech equipment.	1
5985	I did have some wierd thing happen when I first set it up-- it cut out after about an hour...	0
5986	I reset it and it has been good to go since.	1
5987	Not sure what happened there.	0
5988	I have had it for about a month.. All in all I would actually give it about a 4.5 rating.	0
5989	To get a better router you would def have to spend a lot more money than what this one goes for.	1
5990	"I AM NEW TO THIS WHOLE WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY STUFF SO FROM A NOVICE, THIS WORKS WELL WITH MY TOSHIBA LAPTOP ( VISTA HOME PREMIUM ) AND IS EASY TO SET UP BUT THE SOFTWARE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO MONITOR YOUR CONNECTION GAVE ME SUCH PROBLEMS KEEPING ME CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET THAT I HAD TO SCRAP THE WHOLE THING."	1
5991	WHEN I STARTED OVER AND JUST CONNECTED THE ROUTER IT HAS BEEN WORKING FLAWLESSLY.	1
5992	I HAVENT YET CALLED CISCO TO FIND OUT WHY THE MONITOR SOFTWARE KEPT DROPPING MY CONNECTION BUT OTHER THAN THAT I AM HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT.	0
5993	ALSO IT HAS GIVEN ME AN ACCESS POINT SO I CAN CONNECT MY PSP FOR UPDATES AND SUCH.	0
5994	GOOD ELECTRONIC HUNTING :)	1
5995	I have had an older Netgear router (G) and have had long-term experiences with intermittent dropped connections and required modem resettings.	0
5996	"The range was ok for my house, but not exceptional"	1
5997	I saw all the advertising for the new N routers and so decided to buy the 160N	0
5998	"Generally, the router has nothing to recommend it.-Set up was not smooth."	1
5999	"Instructions were not tailored for DSL, so I had to research this on the internet.-After changing routers, I immediately had significantly more lost connections.-I checked speeds with both G and N notebooks and found the 160N generally to be slower.-I also lost my ability to use my SlingBox, which was the decisive disadvantage."	0
6000	"There may well be some technical fixes for this, but after  searching the internet and spending probably four hours, I found nothing that worked"	0
6001	"In sum, I see no real advantage to moving to this N router."	1
6002	"I was a little concerned when I read the reviews that claimed difficult set-ups, but what the heck?"	0
6003	Ive set up a bunch of wireless networks and didnt expect any problems.	0
6004	"Boy was I wrong...The router set-up wizard did a very nice job, but seemed to have problems addressing my workstation once the hard-wired connection was removed."	0
6005	"After powering down and restarting the cable modem, router and computer, I got connections on my workstation and my laptop."	0
6006	"Then, when I tried to add security (WPA), everything broke again."	0
6007	After 3 hours I gave up and went to bed	0
6008	"Next morning, I reset the router and started from scratch."	0
6009	"Amazingly, it went smoothly this time and I was up and running with WPA on all systems within 30 minutes."	1
6010	Nothing in my experience can account for the issues I had with this	0
6011	Performance?	1
6012	"Ah, well, lets just say it was worth the effort."	1
6013	"Im running one distant workstation with an n wireless adaptor, plus a laptop and my wifes system on g adaptors."	1
6014	"ALL of them are much snappier and the distant workstation now has a superb connection (which I never enjoyed before).Bottom line, go for it."	1
6015	"You may struggle (like I did) or you may have a simple set-up (like I did), but once its done, I predict youll be pleased with the result."	1
6016	I bought this router to replace a Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G I had that was going bad.	0
6017	I thought that would be a good time to upgrade to the world of Wireless-N.	1
6018	"Unfortunately, I chose this router"	0
6019	"It looks great, setup was easy, and all that jazz"	1
6020	"Then on day 2, I couldnt get a signal."	1
6021	"I tried everything, but nothing worked."	1
6022	So I rebooted the router.	0
6023	"As soon as the router came back up, my computer connected."	0
6024	I thought it was just a glitch	0
6025	"Day 3, I couldnt get a signal."	1
6026	"I rebooted again, and again, the signal came back"	0
6027	"Day 4, same thing."	0
6028	"Hmmm... Im noticing a pattern hereAlso, part of the allure of this router was the advertised MIMO technology uses multiple radios to create a robust signal that travels farther and reduces dead spots."	0
6029	The signal doesnt even reach as far as my old WRT54G did	1
6030	"On the bright side, however, computers that are hard wired into the ports on the back of the router work wonderfully, and have not lost signal yet."	0
6031	"But if I wanted everything plugged into my router, I wouldnt have spent the extra on the wireless capabilities"	1
6032	Id say definitely not worth buying	1
6033	This was a VERY easy product to set up and start using.	1
6034	I would describe myself as having average to slightly above-average technical knowledge.	1
6035	The instructions were EASY to follow and set-up took no more than 5 minutes in total (total actual time!	0
6036	"I have a 4,300+/- sq"	1
6037	"ft house and the range is good enough that the modem and router are on one end of the 2nd floor of the house, and my laptops are on the 1st floor on the opposite side of the house and they get a good connection"	1
6038	I have had Comcast broadband for the last month and I have thought that it was no faster than the AT&T DSL service I had previously had.	1
6039	"Since I started using this router, I have noticed the internet to be remarkably faster"	1
6040	"Anyway, I would recommend the product as being easy to install, providing a good connection to wireless devices, and providing a fast internet experience."	1
6041	"After moving to a bigger place, I needed a router with wider range so I bought this product to replace my old Wireless-G router (WRT54GC)."	0
6042	"The room where I place the router and the room where I use my laptop is about 35 feet away, but the signal of this router is either very low or none, which is about same as my old Wireless-G router."	1
6043	"So after spending hours on talking to Linksys support (as usual) and trying out different configurations, he told me that I have too many walls so that signal cant travel."	1
6044	"So since the signal didnt improve at all, I decided to return it."	1
6045	"This router might work better for people who lives in wide open space, but if you have walls between the router and the device, you might want to consider the different options."	1
6046	"This is a good product, My old router wouldnt connect when WAP was set up, with this router WAP is set up and working great on the first try,and it sets up in minutes, RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY..."	1
6047	"After considerable deliberation about what brand of wireless router to buy, I went with this Linksys model, as I had previously used a wired Linksys router that had performed well for the past few years."	1
6048	I also purchased a Linksys Dual-Band Wireless-N USB Network Adapter(WUSB600N) for a second computer	1
6049	"Now that the router is working, I am very happy with the product, I am getting a strong signal, fast connection and good coverage throughout my 2600 ft^2, two-level house"	1
6050	"However, when I got first tried to install the product, I ran into all types of problems."	0
6051	"I tried to use the installation software that came with the router, but even after repeated attempts, the set-up procedure failed, as the router failed to recognize the active internet connection."	0
6052	"I could verify that the connection was active because when I re-connected the old router to the modem, the Internet was detected immediately"	0
6053	At that point I called Linksys customer service.	0
6054	The call started off badly because there was so much background chatter at their call center that I could hardly hear the person I was speaking with.	0
6055	"After describing the problem, the person I was speaking with repeatedly put me on hold while she relayed my problem with their technician."	0
6056	"This three-way conversation went on for 20 minutes, and despite asking I was never given the opportunity to speak directly with the technician, only with the operator, which seems ridiculous when you are calling for technical assistance."	0
6057	"In the end, she basically told me that it wasnt their problem and I needed to speak with my Internet provider to see why I wasnt getting a connection, even though I repeatedly pointed out that I could get an immediate connection with the old router attached"	0
6058	"At that point, not being particularly technically savvy, I called a local computer repair company to come to my home and install the router."	0
6059	"He diagnosed the problem in about 2 minutes (the MAC address was not correct), unfortunately at the cost of about $100 for the service call"	0
6060	"I had read about Linksyss reputation for poor customer service before, but had not experienced it personally before now."	0
6061	"Bottom line, this is a good router and it works well, but if you run into problems with installation or operation, dont look to Linksys for help."	1
6062	Youll have to deal with the problems yourself.	0
6063	The router was easy to set up.	1
6064	My laptop received a solid Internet connection with no problem.	0
6065	Normally I am very reluctant in writing reviews for the products that I buy.	0
6066	"But for this one, I was kinda forced to write this up."	0
6067	I am sorta  little bit of techie as I am a Software Professional.	1
6068	I had a Netgear (54MBPS) G router which I have been using since last 3 years.	1
6069	Suddenly it started giving me a lot of trouble and I tried probably every trick under the sun to fix this without much of the luck.	0
6070	Then I decided to upgrade my wireless router.	0
6071	"As my new VAIO (CR-405E)supports the Network adapters for the N mode, I thought to go for a draft-N router."	1
6072	"After doing quite a bit of research, finally settled with this 160N from Linksys."	1
6073	"The first look, I got amazed with its size and shape."	1
6074	Its sleek and stylish.	1
6075	Then I took around 5-7 minutes to get it run and the speed of internet I got was mind blowing.	1
6076	I ran a upload/download tool to see the performance and I got shocked when I saw it can support upto 3-5 MBPS of download speed (As my ISP is providing around 6-7 MBPS of download speed).	0
6077	Connection never dropped.	0
6078	"Since then, never had any issues with the internet connection at all."	0
6079	"Overall, As of now I am absolutely delighted to have this as my Wireless Router.... :)."	1
6080	"After spending an hour on a call with the Linksys techs in India, they were able to get my router up and working again after having me change every imaginable router setting."	0
6081	"Not 1 hour later, the router quit working again (stopped broadcasting signal)."	0
6082	"Worked fine when I was plugged into it, just refused to work wirelessly with any of the 6 devices I have in my home which are all wireless G. Gave up and returned the router today."	1
6083	I was having a lot of trouble with my old netgear router dropping 802.11g connections so I picked up a WRT160n router from Best Buy hoping it would solve my problems.	0
6084	Unfortunately the WRT160n also kept dropping my connection from a MacBook Pro w/ Airport Extreme	0
6085	In a last ditch drastic effort I flashed the factory firmware with DD-WRT v24 and it has been rock solid.	1
6086	It was a pretty easy upgrade but its not for the faint of heart.	1
6087	"I believe flashing the firmware voids warranty on the thing, so keep that in mind before you brick the router"	0
6088	"So bottom line -- WRT160n is piece of crap, but decent if you install Linux on it."	0
6089	"Ok i first bought a d-link dir-655 Xtreme N gigabit router and I couldnt make it work Because it was toooo hard to set it with IP adress and such things.. Then I returned it and got this unit and was SOOOOOOO EASY that it was running and working in my PC(wired), laptop(wireless), Ps3 (wireless) in just 5 minutes... Only need to insert the CD and that was all.. very good range... for me never dropped a connection NEVERRR... i live in a 2 floor concrete house and it had signal around all the house and even in the backyard!!!"	1
6090	Now I got the 310N version just because a friend sell me one neww cheaper than this !!	1
6091	but it works the same as this one ... for me the same range... same signal strength.. Dont need to spend the extra money for the WRT-310N get this one!	1
6092	Easy to set up and use.	1
6093	Very sleek design.	1
6094	Much better than the previous version.	1
6095	Connected to a set up with a Hughes satellite system within minutes.	1
6096	Router has worked fine.	1
6097	Im really pleased with this product	1
6098	"It was super easy to install, and took about 15 minutes."	1
6099	All you have to do is install the CD and choose 2 or 3 options on a few pages.	1
6100	"I was not looking forward to doing this, but it worked beautifully."	1
6101	"As far as signal strength is concerned, it seems to work pretty well."	1
6102	"I live an older building with really thick walls, but I can get a very strong signal no matter where I am"	1
6103	"The router looks really sleek, and its not totally obnoxious looking like some others Ive seen"	1
6104	I would recommend this product to anyone I know.	1
6105	"Initially, we were skeptical."	0
6106	We purchased the WRT160N and followed the instructions.	0
6107	"Within 15 minutes we were wireless, networked, printing on one printer from laptop and desktop, and enjoying the shared file capability"	1
6108	How easy is the set up?	1
6109	EASY.	1
6110	I DO recommend that the firmware is downloaded FIRST as the set up disk prompts.	1
6111	"After that, it is click and play"	1
6112	"While we did not get fancy in including any additional equipment like phone or games, setting up a secure wireless network and having the computers be truly networked has never been easier."	1
6113	"Oh, and the performance of the WRT160N is tremendous."	0
6114	"Fast, accurte, complete with distance"	1
6115	I would recommend it to anyone over any other Wireless-N piece of equipment.	1
6116	This product works really well.	1
6117	I feel though that there should be a recall on the product though many of the products are running extreamly hot and some people have problems configuring the product.	0
6118	I have been working with linksys products for over 7 years now this is by far the fast router I have ever used.	1
6119	I have my laptop hook up to the router on a Intel Draft N card built in my laptop.	1
6120	I will receive about 130MBPS.	1
6121	I have a wireless B printer and my PS3 hooked up on the linksys router.	1
6122	They all work really well	1
6123	ProsGreat look space saver for smaller areas such as a studio and a dorm roomBlends in to about everythingRuns just as fast with a heavy load on the router such as two computers on it at the same time and the PS3 on gamer mode	1
6124	ConsRuns hot really hot.	1
6125	like a 3 year old laptopConfigures easy.	1
6126	Its so easy a monkey can do it	1
6127	Would I buy it again?I live in a small area and linksys has the most secure settings on the market.	1
6128	I love the looks even though the heat issue is major for me I can live with it or until they make a fix for the router.	0
6129	This is a bad company.	0
6130	"I purchased a wireless router from them and, truth be told, it never really worked right."	1
6131	"The speed was ok, but it was impossible to set up without tech support and every so often it would simply stop working."	0
6132	When that happened I would be forced to call tech support and spend 30-60 minutes on the phone fighting with them about resetting the router.	1
6133	I recently purchased a new computer and decided to save a little money by moving this router to it.	0
6134	When I called tech support I was told that the router was out of its warranty period and they could not help me... unless I would pay them to.	0
6135	"Thats right, I would have to pay for the assistance on their product - a working product because it was not under warranty"	0
6136	So be warned that you are only buying the option to use Linksys products for a limited time - that is if you have any problems whatsoever that require tech support.	0
6137	I am now trying a Trendnet.	0
6138	Lets see if they are any better.	1
6139	I have been very pleased with my purchase of this product.	1
6140	It offers great speed and range for my wireless devices.	1
6141	802.11g devices have no problem connecting to it.	0
6142	Setup was a breeze.	0
6143	I highly recommend this router.	1
6144	"Excellent product I replaced my old router for this one and I really like how it works, I am not an expert in computers, bur it was really easy to install."	1
6145	"For years, we have been happy users of a Netgear MR314 wireless router."	1
6146	But it didnt reach the farthest corner of our home.	1
6147	"In looking at various routers, I found many mixed reviews for the newer Netgear routers, so decided to try the Linksys WRT160N."	0
6148	We use almost nothing but Macs in our home	0
6149	"Setup: Forget the included CD that comes with this router, it is Windows only."	0
6150	It does have the User Guide as a PDF buried in one of the folders.	0
6151	But it is not much help	1
6152	"Instead, just turn on the router, look for the wireless signal (or plug in directly using an ethernet cable), then use FireFox - the current Safari doesnt work and any changes cause a server unexpectedly dropped connection error"	0
6153	"Type: 192.168.1.1 in the browser, then user name linksys and password admin to get the web based setup menus"	0
6154	"From there, if you have any questions, click on the Help link for the individual pages."	0
6155	The help there is much better than in the User Guide	1
6156	"This router does reach the far corner of our house, and is able to use WPA, etc"	1
6157	"I would have given the router 5 stars if the documentation had been better, and if the Mac had been included."	0
6158	"Even though its really really simple to set up the Mac for wireless, its still nice to be recognized.)"	1
6159	"Bought this to upgrade from my Linksys Wireless-G Router, and am glad I made the investment."	1
6160	"The speed and range of the previous Linksys router was fine, and pretty reliable all-in-all."	1
6161	"However, this new model definitely improves my overall experience by giving me faster speeds and a much broader broadcast that means I can get really strong signals from different rooms and floors of my house."	1
6162	"I recommend Linksys products in general, and this one gets high scores as well."	1
6163	"Its also got an incredibly sleek, cool-looking design compared to other routers."	1
6164	After 6 years I replaced my old wireless b router with this N router.	1
6165	I had difficulties with a weak signal with the old one.	0
6166	With the old one the signal sometimes dropped completely and it roled me over to a stronger wireless signal from one of my neighbours.	1
6167	This N Router has a powerfull signal.	1
6168	It improved the reliability of receiving a wireless signal a lot.	1
6169	"The router looks slick, it is small  and stylisch compared to the old one."	1
6170	Installing was easy an quick.	1
6171	Good documentation.	1
6172	I had difficulty going through the recommended WPA set-up compared with the WEP set-up I was used to.	1
6173	"I dont understand the need for all the options, but I guess you can always select the default."	0
6174	Some of the wireless game receivers had difficulty with the WPA set-up.	0
6175	I therefore plugged my old wireless into one of the ports and set that up with WEP for the game applications.	0
6176	It is all working fine.	1
6177	I wanted to like this sleek router and I paid extra for the N capability as I wanted to improve my connection strength and speed.	1
6178	"Unfortunately, this works no better than my G router, in fact it keeps disconnecting me from the internet for no reason at all and even when it works the signal strength keeps fluctuating and the Connected box keeps popping up every few minutes making it extremely annoying."	0
6179	"In fact, the signal strength is actually poorer in some spots where it used to be good."	0
6180	It also does not support VPN connections and results in a lot of drop outs.	0
6181	I also use a Vonage VOIP phone over my cable internet connection which is connected to this router.	1
6182	"I was expecting some voice quality improvement too after installing this router, but there is no improvement at all."	1
6183	"In fact, since the connection keeps getting dropped people keep thinking Im hanging up on them, which is not good at all!However on the pro side, the set up of this router was super-easy and took no effort on my part."	0
6184	All I did was pop in the CD and then followed the simple directions and 10 minutes later the router was installed	0
6185	I find the design very sleek but the blue icons on the front panel are very brightly lit and very distracting at night unless covered with something	0
6186	"Overall, I am quite disappointed with the performance of this router and Im going to send it back and go back to my older G-router."	0
6187	I have used wireless networking at work for quite a while but had put off installing it at home for security reasons.	1
6188	"With a few new gadgets that could take advantage of new high speed capabilities, I decided to jump in and ordered a WRT160N to replace my existing Linksys wired router"	1
6189	The wireless router showed up very quickly on my doorstep.	1
6190	I unpacked it and was very impressed with the small size and the good looks.	1
6191	"I appreciate technology, but I like the style of this unit since it does not appear to be an alien space craft"	1
6192	"Loading the CD and following the instructions, I had it up and running in just a few minutes."	1
6193	"My new laptop connected wirelessly very quickly and a few simple firewall updates had the system running the existing wired network, the laptop and even my Blackberry Curve using the WPA2 Personal security encoding with minimal hassle or delay."	0
6194	Connection speed was 130 Mbs and I was able to get a signal at the far end of the house.	1
6195	Subsequent connections had no problems either.	0
6196	I was impressed	1
6197	"As I mentioned, I was connecting my laptop from work to the system."	0
6198	"My employer is security conscious, so we use a VPN every time we connect from outside our building."	0
6199	The WRT160N connected using the VPN without a problem.	0
6200	"However, part of the WPA security protocol is the concept of changing the encryption key on a regular basis."	0
6201	The sender and receiver are supposed to exchange the new key and then continue on seamlessly.	1
6202	"Unfortunately, the router dropped the internet connection every time the key changed."	0
6203	"This was a pain, especially when doing big file transfers when the connection was dropped."	0
6204	"The dropped connection cannot be reconnected until I went through the whole VPN authentication routine again, which gave me another hour or less if I didnt manually re-connect  right away"	0
6205	I set to the key resynchronization interval to different times (very easy to do in the router control panel) and confirmed this was the cause.	1
6206	My family also noticed some weird browser lockups that had not occurred before installing the router (or after replacing it).I contacted Linksys technical support about this issue.	0
6207	"First, I will say that I was very impressed with the support person I spoke with."	1
6208	"They responded very quickly, were knowledgeable about their product and very helpful."	1
6209	They seemed very friendly too.	1
6210	"Unfortunately, they told me that dropping the internet connection when changing keys was a known problem with the WRT160N."	0
6211	I suppose these things happen (dont the developers try this with their Cisco/Linksys laptop at night?	0
6212	", so I inquired about a firmware patch."	0
6213	"Unfortunately, there is no patch scheduled at this point."	0
6214	"They suggested using WEP, but I noted that their own manual stated that WEP encryption was easily broken, not secure and not recommended."	0
6215	There was no push-back on this	0
6216	"I discussed the situation with the support person, and they recommended that I return the unit."	1
6217	So I did...I took it to the post office this morning	0
6218	"In honesty, the support provided was about the best I have ever."	1
6219	"The symptoms were quickly understood, problem was identified, a possible solution was proposed and an honest recommendation was made in a matter of minutes."	0
6220	They even sent me a complete transcript of the exchange.	0
6221	"I was very impressed with the support team, especially compared to some other high-tech products"	1
6222	I wanted to like this unit and never have to think about it again (because it was just doing its job).	1
6223	"Installation was fast and easy, it looked good, and it connected well."	1
6224	Support was top notch.	1
6225	"However, dropping the connection all the time is not acceptable."	0
6226	I consider this very normal usage (certainly not an exotic application) that should not happen.	0
6227	I am back to the wired router.	0
6228	"It is working, but I am disappointed with the WRT160N."	0
6229	"We use Macs at home, but upon opening the WRT-160N I discovered that the install CD is Windows only."	0
6230	"And unfortunately, everything in the box screams at you to INSTALL CD FIRST!."	0
6231	"I do use Parallels, so I used the CD in the Windows side, but it didnt go smoothly."	1
6232	"Unable to detect internet connection, didnt configure the router properly, other hiccups"	0
6233	"On Linksys support page for the WRT-160N, there is a Mac option, but it links to the same documents used for Windows."	1
6234	Nothing actually addresses supporting the product on the Mac	1
6235	"After a bumpy installation, and finally getting the Macs connected to the network, the signal and speed are very impressive."	1
6236	"Id been getting a lot of random disconnecting with our previous router, a D-Link DI-524 G).It does have a SecureEasy Setup button, which I was excited to try with our Brother MFC which supports it."	1
6237	"But they would not find each other, no matter what I tried."	0
6238	"I dont know whether the fault was with the Brother or the Linksys, but it didnt work"	0
6239	"Overall, Im impressed."	1
6240	"The wireless connection has been rock-solid so far, and the router looks terrific."	1
6241	"But Mac owners be warned, setup will likely be a hassle."	0
6242	I bought the Linksys WRT160N Ultra RangePlus router to add Wireless-N capability to my network.	1
6243	The router was easy to install into the existing network and was up and running within minutes.	1
6244	I have only been using it for a couple days but I am so far very impressed.	1
6245	The range with my wireless-G laptop was extended by about 30 0x1.887e01p-975nd my new wireless-N laptop can now receive a signal in the back garden.	0
6246	"My house is built with bricks and concrete so the wireless range is naturally reduced compaired to a wooden structure, but I have found this router capable of supplying my wireless needs throughout the house and garden."	1
6247	"If you plan to buy this guy for use with P2P systems, beware."	0
6248	"Apparently, it cant handle too many open connections and drops connection completely, freezes to the point when you have to cycle power."	0
6249	This is a known problem and you will be able to find more about it if you search online.	0
6250	"Otherwise, gives you multitude of useful features and is pretty good for regular home use."	1
6251	I FIND THAT IT DOESNOT WORK WELL WITH THE HP MEDIA SMART TVTHE SIGNAL IS NOT POWERFUL ENOUGHBUT FOR REGULAR COMPUTER USE NOT BAD	1
6252	I noticed a lot of so so reviews and was wary until I read a professional review praising its easy set up.	1
6253	I decided to go for it and boy am I glad I did.	1
6254	I happen to be a novice setting up PC related stuff but this router was cake to set up.	1
6255	"Be forwarned; however, my intention was to simply set up wireless with encryption and nothing else."	0
6256	I had no desire to set up a full blown network with file and printer sharing.	0
6257	I simply wanted encrypted wireless for my xp windows pc and vista windows laptop in the house.	1
6258	I figure I can print stuff by using the pc with the printer or using a flash drive so I had no desire in oversteaping my technical boundries	0
6259	"That being said... it was as simple as putting the disk in, following directions printing the encryption code and connecting the router."	0
6260	Easy as cake!	1
6261	I had more trouble configuring the recieving vista windows laptop and xp windows pc!	0
6262	Which wasnt that hard either.	0
6263	The router is connected to my windows vista desktop and my windows vista laptop and seperate xp windows desktop are recieving the signal.	0
6264	It was as easy as plugging in the code to the recieving laptop and pc	0
6265	The signal is always strong and no breaks in three weeks of constant use.	0
6266	"Despite other comments, the signal strength is awesome even with the unit under a shelf."	1
6267	Unless you live in a 25 room mansion or set up the network wrong... you should have no problems.	0
6268	I have absolutely no complaints.	0
6269	The cherry on top is how awesome this router looks and with no antenna!	1
6270	You could easly hide this under a shelf but why would you want to!	1
6271	Its beautiful and you could use it as decoration!	1
6272	"I admit, it is pricey but well worth the money in the headaches you will save setting it up and the aesthetic factor."	0
6273	This is an update to the March 2008 review.	0
6274	It now Feb 25th 2010 and no problems.	0
6275	In fact we now have expanded the office and have 8 lap tops running off this router constantly and and when we have visitors like recently we had 14 laptops running off of the same ONE router	1
6276	So after 23 months no problems and the bandwidth continues to be constant and strong.	0
6277	We have various folks on it with Windows XP and Windows 7 now and no problems to connect to any of the computers.	0
6278	Cant say enough how impressed we all are and we are in the tech industry.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Overview - We are on AT&T DSL running the Elite broadband which is 3-6 Mbps.	1
6279	Our average speed is running 5+ Mbps here in the office and that is with Vonage VoIP phones (6 lines) and 4 laptopsWe just hooked up the the Linksys WRT160N Ultra RangePlus Wireless-N router in our new office onto 3 Dell laptops and 1 LG laptop.	1
6280	"After the intial install on all the laptops running Windows XP Pro, we had only one minor glitch and that is a firmware upgrade needed on the Intel Wireless 4985 card on one of the Dells."	0
6281	"It will not run currently on the Intel Pro Wireless card, everything G and below works fine."	1
6282	But it does run on Windows Wireless configuration just fine.	1
6283	We are all averaging 80 - 140 Mbps depending on how much load is on the line with the phones and broadband activity	1
6284	"I can not speak for the range of the unit yet since the office is only 1300 sq feet and we just hooked up the router, but Im approximately 40 ft away with no problems."	0
6285	"Im so impressed how quick this is, I think I will go junk my Linksys Wireless G router and go buy another one of these for my home (Comcast Cable and Comcast Digital Phone which is also VoIP) just for the performance and good looks with the antennae now built in"	1
6286	"Last thought, as I read these reviews people seem to bash the router when in fact typically it is the computer configuration or the wireless card that is at fault for not having the lastest firmware installed or the hardware not working."	0
6287	Another potential problem is if your system is standard broadband (CAT5 cable) this is the router you need.	0
6288	"If you purchase the GIGABIT router and do not have the bandwidth or CAT6 cable, you may possibly get impeded results."	0
6289	Ive tried Belkin and NetGear products before and neither were as compact as this Linksys WRT160N UltraRangePlus Router.	1
6290	"This product is exceptionally thin, easy to install, easy to use and also includes the best tool anyone would want, a LinkSysEasyLinkAdvisor."	1
6291	"This item makes it simple to repair connections should something go wrong, or if one wants to add devices (such as a remote laptop computer with a Wireless Adapter)."	0
6292	Im simply blown away by this product and the price is very competitive.	1
6293	FINALLY!	0
6294	A router that fixes all of the problems I was having.	0
6295	"My old router, a D-Link Draft N had trouble connecting wirelessly with my Dell Laptop and my MacBook Pro."	0
6296	Draft-N routhers dont all conform to the same standards.	0
6297	It did work with my iMac wirelessly and it did OK with my wired connections	0
6298	"So, I decided to tey an Apple Airport Extreme."	0
6299	"It worked with all my wireless devices, but supprisingly did not do well passing HD TV Shows from my Media Center PC to my Xbox 360 over a wire!So, after much research I decided to try this Linksys."	1
6300	"Since it just hit the market, I figured it would have better Draft-N support"	1
6301	"So, with minimal configuration, this routher works with ALL my devices:(I have it setup with WPA/WPA2 Wireless security.) MacBook Pro (Draft-N Wireless)Dell Vostro Laptop (Draft-N)Apple iMAc (Draft-N)Apple iPod Touch (Whatever wireless it uses...)AppleTV (Wireless)Nintendo Wii (Wireless)2 Wired Windows PCsPlaystation 3 (Wired)Xbox 360 (Wired)Plus it has no trouble passing the HD TV shows from my Windows Media Center PC to my Xbox360."	0
6302	I puchased this directly from Amazon	1
6303	"It was so easy to set up, it comes with a set up CD that does everything for you!"	1
6304	"No problems using my laptop in the other end of the house, nice strong signal."	1
6305	"The unit is sleek and small, takes up very small space on an overcrowded workspace."	1
6306	i bought this router from BestBuy.	0
6307	i have 6MBPS-12MBPS internet connection at home.	0
6308	i have wireless N card on my laptop) i tested internet connection  sitting 2feets from the router and max internet speed was 12MBPS.	1
6309	"i went inside my room (may be around 10-15feets from the router) tested for the speed and it was only 700kbps(by the way, my room doors were closed)."	0
6310	i dont think its worth $108 for this router.	1
6311	94reduction in speed huh!!!)	0
6312	"I bought this unit and the matching Cisco-Linksys AE1000 High-Performance Wireless-N Adapter, thinking they would work together."	1
6313	"Boy was I wrong, these things are like ornry brothers, they may be made by the same company but they act like oil and water."	1
6314	"The units are less than 20 feet apart, clear shot no walls, they just dont like to connect or stay connected, and you have to use the hidden network key to access the wireless router."	1
6315	"You would think that by being made by the same company they would naturally work together, bull, get the cheapest chinese crap you can live with and stay away from this overpriced paper wieght."	0
6316	"Customer service is foriegn, and they have lousy phone connections."	0
6317	Outside the warrenty by 2 days?	0
6318	29 bucks.	0
6319	"This is Cisco crap, stay away."	0
6320	I use this router on a home network with approximately 4-8 devices.	0
6321	"Two printers, two wired Macs, and a few laptops/smartphones using it for WiFi."	1
6322	"There are 2-3 other WiFi networks within range of our house, none of which conflict with our reception"	0
6323	"Im no IT professional, but Im a programmer with very high comfort levels in adjusting settings, etc."	1
6324	"Ive tried configuring this thing in every way possible: changing broadcast modes, channels, protection settings, subnets, etc."	1
6325	And it continues to display lackluster performance	1
6326	"To summarize, the biggest flaws this router has are: 1) speed, 2) signal strength, and 3) DNS issues"	0
6327	"Speed is really up-and-down, and although its WiFi there should never be this big of a loss, given the lack of interference from other networks"	0
6328	Signal strength is huge... a computer that is sitting 4 feet from the router will frequently have a signal strength of 50-60	1
6329	A computer 15-20 yards away has very little chance of connecting to the network.	0
6330	"Granted, the router lives in a somewhat disadvantageous location (with some obstructions, etc."	0
6331	between it and some of the areas where wed like to connect) but its signal issues occur even in locations near to the router	0
6332	"DNS issues... not the biggest problem, but these routers have DNS routing problems, where sometimes an attempt to connect to google"	0
6333	com will land you on facebook	0
6334	"com, or any other number of strange behaviors."	0
6335	"A simple cache flush will fix the problem, but I shouldnt need to do this"	0
6336	"Overall, its an OK router but youre better off paying 2x as much for something that works, all the time, and everywhere you need it to!"	1
6337	My usage for this router has been light.	0
6338	At most a couple of laptops and smartphones were connected to it.	1
6339	No heavy downloads (i am not a gamer or a heavy downloader) and this router has worked well for me in last two years.	1
6340	I am guessing it will probably have life for another two.	0
6341	Cant complain.	0
6342	"I am a med student who depends on internet streaming for lectures and for my breaks from studying (Netflix, and Xbox Live)."	0
6343	"This router worked fabulously for the 1sst 6 months - my only initial problem was getting an open NAT setting for Xbox Live, but that was solved by internet forums and turning of uPnP."	0
6344	I boasted about it to everyone.	0
6345	"However, the next 3 months began to drive me nuts - It would drop connections daily, so I solved this by turning the router off during the day and turning it back on when I got home - It otherwise would just NOT work."	0
6346	"No amount of resets, factory resets, preference changing fixed it."	1
6347	"Eventually, the wireless capabilities died altogether, and I found myself being forced to do everything hard wired into my wireless router."	0
6348	Im sure you can imagine the frustration.	0
6349	"Not only that, but I could also no longer get an open NAT setting for Xbox Live, no matter what I did."	1
6350	"I tried playing with security, uPnP, port forwarding, nothing, and basically that means that I cant play with my friends back home online because I keep getting dropped from their groups."	0
6351	"Netflix streaming even took a dive, and that was with it being wired in, and that was the last straw"	0
6352	"High Yield: Works great for a short period, and then it becomes progressively more useless."	1
6353	VERY short lifespan (not even a full year).	0
6354	I bought this item refurbished for 32 dollars delivered through Electronica.	1
6355	It took seconds to set up and runs perfect.	1
6356	No complaints about product or seller both couldnt be better.	1
6357	Wonderful.	1
6358	Ive had the Linksys/Cisco WRT160N (V3) router for about a year now and its been a lot of trouble.	0
6359	It wont consistently maintain our in-home cable modem speeds (and Im speaking of wired connections) over long periods of times.	0
6360	"We have a 20 Mbps cable Internet connection and without daily resets of the router, that drops to about 1 Mbps."	0
6361	There is no reason to pay for 20 Mbps when the router bottleneck reduces our Internet speed to 51520712554f what we are actually paying for	0
6362	"About a month ago, I switched to an Asus Wireless-N Router (RT-N56U) and havent had to reset once."	1
6363	Its been rock solid which has dramatically improved streaming video on Netflix and Skype	1
6364	I wish that I had abandoned the Linksys WRT160N (V3) a long time ago.	0
6365	"I cant say that Im as impressed with the Linksys/Cisco name as I was in the past (I have three of their routers).Admittedly, the Asus router is considerably more expensive, but its been flawless compared to the constant resets and unreliability of the WRT106N"	0
6366	It would take a heck-of-a-lot of 4.5 to 5.0 star reviews of a Linksys/Cisco product before I would try one of their home products again.	0
6367	"It might be a good product from Linksys, but its really really buggy one."	1
6368	Change your mind and move to other brand or model from Linksys... there is no solution!!	0
6369	Cisco doesnt do anything to help the owners of this router!!	0
6370	After few hours the WiFi connection dropouts and you must to reset the router to restablish the wifi connectivity.	0
6371	"Sincerely, its not worthy to buy this model...Please, check this link out, where a 6-page-post at the official Cisco forum does not resolve the problems that due since 03/29/2009:[...]Terrible... Im going to return this router and spend my money buying a reliable and fully functionally router from DLINK or whatever."	0
6372	I bought this item because I was told Cisco-Linksys was a good company that stood behind its products.	1
6373	I was misinformed.	0
6374	"The setup wouldnt work on my older desktop XP system which had worked just fine with my Zoomtown DSL, I had bought a new Sony Vaio and wanted a wireless connection."	1
6375	The setup worked fine on the laptop.	1
6376	"I started having problems right away, I was getting Invalid URLs and the bookmark I had for Facebook started sending me to a Wikimedia site that showed This Wiki does not yet exist."	0
6377	The address in the window was the facebook address.	0
6378	The only way to get the router to work was to unplug it and plug it back in and refresh.	1
6379	This problem occurred on both computers.	0
6380	"I talked to the tech support and was told it was Zoomtowns fault repeatedly, but if I plug the computers direct to the modem the problem disappears completely."	0
6381	"Zoomtown was very helpful, but Cisco-Linksys just kept pointing the finger and saying its not our fault."	0
6382	Ill be returning this router and trying a different companies product.	0
6383	"Pros: Pretty good router, fast at what it does -- I was up and running with it within 5 minutes; I never use those install CDs, I prefer to set them up directly and it was industry standard for consumer router"	1
6384	"Cons: Aside from the miserable admin font, within 24 hours the DNS cache was poisoned."	0
6385	"Apparently, this model has serious issues (as youll see in forums across the internet in direct relation to this router) that Cisco apparently will not fix."	0
6386	"If they have fixed it, then their latest firmware update does not specify that they have fixed it."	0
6387	This morning I tried to go to facebook and it took me to some swedish guys home page.	0
6388	"I tried this in chrome, firefox, and ie9 and they all had the same destination."	0
6389	"I cleaned each browser cache, and then it took me to some insurance companys website."	0
6390	Ran a malware check on the system and none was found.	0
6391	I replaced the router with a previous one that did not have the issue and the dns problem was resolved.	0
6392	"At that point, I changed back to this suspect router and the issue had returned."	0
6393	"I upgraded the firmware to the difficult to find firmware upgrade on the cisco/linksys page ( [...]), then hard coded OpenDNS entries in for their DNS servers (208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220) and the issue was resolved."	0
6394	Cisco needs to fix this horrible issue.	0
6395	"IfI had known this before I would have bought it, I would have chosen another router."	0
6396	"Im glad the issue was easy to resolve, but there should not have been an issue in the first place."	0
6397	I love the range you get with this linksys.	1
6398	It easy to set up and user friendly.	1
6399	Overall the product is good but if you dont have a warranty the customer service department would not assist you very much at all.	1
6400	I have one of these units to replace my Cisco AP1120B that decided to die.	0
6401	I cant determine a range advantage at all.	1
6402	"Also, you cant for sure disable gateway mode."	0
6403	Which is a pain since I have a Cisco 871 Router connected to my cable modem.	0
6404	"This router is a little older, but it performs great!"	1
6405	I have a web server running on a computer in my house and was easily able to configure it to route traffic the way I want it to.	0
6406	Wireless-N is quick and much better range	1
6407	"I purchased this model, because it was compatible with dd-wrt, which I installed on my previous wireless-G router."	1
6408	I found that the linksys firmware was good enough for what I needed and didnt bother hacking it.	0
6409	Still its good to have that option if I need it.	1
6410	I am very familiar with routers as I work in networking for a living.	1
6411	The key area of concern I have is reliability.	0
6412	"This router is fairly simple to set up and gives owners the ability to configure many settings, but it is unreliable."	0
6413	"The problems I have experienced are related to the following:DHCP (where the router assigns computers IP addresses):  When enabled, which is the most likely setting, computers can have difficulty re-establishing communications after powering back on or coming out of hibernate."	0
6414	After days of research I found a forum posting suggesting this is the cause.	0
6415	I disabled DHCP and assigned static IP addresses to our computers and the problem went away.	0
6416	"And yes, I tried all sorts of other changes, making one at a time and carefully testing."	0
6417	The DHCP support on this router is terrible	0
6418	Kindle:  It doesnt support the Kindle - not with any combinations of settings.	1
6419	And Amazon Kindle support wont come out and tell you that if you contact them.	1
6420	In my case I worked with them for hours and was supposed to receive a return phone call that never came.	1
6421	When I sent a tickler email it was rejected.	0
6422	"In other words, Amazaon blew me off and I was on my own and it is best to buy a router for which reviews from customers say it works with Kindle if you need that"	1
6423	Drop outs:  After a little more than a year the router would drop out.	0
6424	"We could see the SSID advertised with a strong signal and partially connect, as Windows 7 refers to it, but could not get Internet access without re-booting the router."	1
6425	"This happened about once or twice a day, especially in the morning after taking laptops out of hibernate"	0
6426	I have had it with this router.	0
6427	"You have to be a networking engineer (which is one of my specialties) to use it, and even then it doesnt work well."	1
6428	I ordered a new router this past week and it ran out of the box and works great with none of the problems I described above.	1
6429	I regret I didnt trash this router long ago.	0
6430	I bought this router a year and a half ago.	0
6431	My product warranty ran out six months ago.	0
6432	So now I was just informed by Linksys tech support that in order to get a Firmware update I was going to have to PAY for another warranty because sometimes the firmware damages the router.	0
6433	I am not one to write complaints about products but this was ridiculous!	0
6434	I have to PAY to make sure THEIR software doesnt damage MY hardware?	0
6435	Do you see the absurdity of this concept?	0
6436	I have been purchasing Linksys products for as long as there have been wireless connections and am totally blown away by the consumer wrong-doing by this company.	0
6437	I will not be purchasing their products any longer.	0
6438	"When you pay for it once, you shouldnt have to pay again."	0
6439	Bought this Linksys from Amazon seller (obviously) and it was as decribed.	0
6440	The product itself is exactly what I wanted.	1
6441	I have a small 1300 sq ft home and it works everywhere in it.	1
6442	No lag in speed at all that I have noticed.	0
6443	I dont know about all the extra features but it gives internet to my laptop and that to me is Success	1
6444	"As far as setup goes, I did have some difficulty but mainly due to ignorance."	0
6445	I connected everything and had it all ready to work and got no connection.	1
6446	That was until I hit the refresh button on the Linksys.... Then it perfectly connected.	1
6447	"If you are having difficulties connecting, just hit the refresh button on top front of the Linksys and that may be all you needed to do."	0
6448	I purchased this router when it came out.	1
6449	It constantly disconnects while streaming or downloading	0
6450	I purchased it based on the Linksys website which said it had 32mbs of ram.	1
6451	I purchased version 2 which apparently only has 8gbs of ram.	0
6452	Its extremely disappointing that at the time I purchased the router the Linksys website never mentioned that they were putting significantly less ram into the routers.	0
6453	"Im sure they saved a lot of money doing this, but now I have a router that doesnt work properly, and they have a disgruntled customer"	1
6454	Ill never be purchasing another Linksys / Cisco product ever again.	0
6455	"They used to be such a great company, but now, they just cant be trusted."	1
6456	I have a two part review here.	0
6457	"The first are my first impressions, which primarily deal with the setup."	0
6458	"The second part is my Day 2.---First Impressions---My internet had been timing out on certain sites with my year-old Belkin router, particularly my grad school course centre."	0
6459	I purchased another Belkin on Amazon to replace it as a lightning deal.	0
6460	"It came, I hooked it up, and I was elated that I could get to my schools course centre."	1
6461	"However, it frequently would time out on eBay, Amazon, Facebook, and other pages that I frequent."	0
6462	"Really, it timed out on every page I would frequent except for my schools site."	0
6463	"I figured it was just a glitch in my router, so I exchanged it for the same one."	0
6464	"That second one worked overnight, but the next day it had similar problems."	0
6465	"It wasnt timing out on every site, but it would time out about once every other hour for about 2 minutes."	0
6466	"Again, I could still get to my school course centre, but not online to most sites consistently"	1
6467	So I saw this Linksys on another Lightning Deal and thought to try it out.	0
6468	"My previous experience with Linksys had been fairly poor, but I thought possibly this one would be better."	0
6469	"If not, Amazon has the best customer service and would give me a free return if it crashed."	1
6470	"My previous experience also was not with Cisco-Linksys, and I had heard that Cisco branded Linksys routers were better"	1
6471	I received it and hooked it up.	0
6472	I am used to routers working straight out of the box.	0
6473	"Typically they are set up for DHCP, so they automatically get an IP address from the modem and work just as a switch rather than a router."	0
6474	"This one was set up for DHCP, but it did not work as a switch."	0
6475	It wanted to be a router.	1
6476	It required me to hook up to it directly with my MacBook Pro in order for me to log-in to it.	0
6477	"Even though I knew the IP address, it would not get there."	0
6478	"It also was not compatible with Chrome, and I had to use Safari."	0
6479	Quite irritating.	0
6480	"I had worked as a supervisor for Verizion Business DSL, so I knew what I was doing, but it was still a pain"	0
6481	"After I logged into the router and verified it was all correct, it still didnt work."	1
6482	So I came to the conclusion it wouldnt work as a switch; it had to be a router.	1
6483	"I had to log-in to my modem at that point, which for some reason I couldnt do through the wireless router."	0
6484	I had to hook directly to my modem.	1
6485	"I bridged the modem, put the PPPoE connection in the router, and tried to get online."	0
6486	ATT had some type of Walled Garden set up that wouldnt let me get online with the new router without jumping through a bunch of hoops.	0
6487	"Of course, these hoops required Safari 1.2 or higher, and were not compatible with Chrome or Firefox"	0
6488	"After I jumped through the hoops, I was able to get online with Safari but not Chrome."	0
6489	"I had to restart my browsers, and even then Chrome was extremely slow at loading Google--go figure."	0
6490	It took about 40 seconds to load the main search page.	0
6491	It wouldnt load Amazon at first either.	1
6492	"However, after about 45 minutes of setup and 10 minutes of testing browsing, it picked up speed and hasnt given me a problem since."	0
6493	I am able to get to my schools course centre without any problems so far.	0
6494	I have not had any time outs on any other page as well	1
6495	For curiosity I just ran a traceroute from the terminal to my schools course centre.	0
6496	"It still is timing out on hop 20, but Im able to browse around the site to pages I have not previously opened without any issues"	0
6497	"If it crashes or has the same problems the Belkins did, Ill be sure to update it."	0
6498	"My first impression is that its a huge pain to hook up, and that the average person would not have been able to do it without calling their ISP and being on the phone for 45 minutes, but its reliable."	0
6499	"If you know how to bridge your modem, or if you already have a bridged modem, then youre probably fine."	1
6500	"Otherwise, expect to have to get help"	0
6501	Please note: I have an open WEP connection with no password required.	0
6502	"I have no proxy settings, no advanced settings, and no other settings programmed into the router other than my PPPoE connection (user name and password to get on to the internet)."	1
6503	"So I cant comment on any advanced settings, but for the basic functionality, its pretty good.---Day Two---OK."	1
6504	So my first impressions were not so great.	1
6505	There are a few positives.	1
6506	"The range is decent, and the speed is very good."	1
6507	Reliability on the other hand.... held up much worse than my last Linksys	0
6508	We used the internet all day.	0
6509	"It was much faster than usual, and the reliability was pretty good."	1
6510	"I had woken up in the middle of the night and attempted to manage some things on Amazon and found the site down, but I hoped it was coincidence."	0
6511	The rest of the day was great.	1
6512	"A few times it timed out, but not much"	0
6513	Tonight my wife was syncing her iPhone with iPhoto.	0
6514	My son hit a button and imported all of her pictures.	0
6515	"At that time, coincidentally, she wasnt able to get on Amazon any more."	0
6516	"I thought, Great!"	1

6531	"So, back to square one!"	0
6532	Sending back the Linksys.	0

6536	Going to try a new wireless modem/router that AT&T directly supports.	1
6537	"If I have a problem with that, perhaps I can convince them its their problem."	0
6538	"Regardless, however, tonight could not have been AT&Ts problem."	0
6539	I could not log-into the Linksys when connected directly to do (or wirelessly with the other computer).	0
6540	"Thats a problem with the Linksys, which was the same problem my last Linksys had."	0

6547	I did my research and stumbled across this model.	0
6548	I am glad I did.	1
6549	Learned alot when I was setting it up.	0
6550	Didnt understand something so I called customer support.	1

6557	"While I was prepared to write glowing review, I recently noticed a problem with the power supply and startup of this router."	0
6558	This startup problem has been observed by other users who apparently believe they have a defective product and posted their experiences on the web.	0
6559	Hopefully this review will help as there is a simple solution	0
6560	"Basically, if the power supply is cold (disconnected from electrical outlet several hours) and STILL ATTACHED to the router, the Cisco-Linksys WRT160N will have trouble starting up when the DC power supply is plugged into the electrical outlet."	0
6561	The router goes into an endless loop in what appears to be a failed boot sequence with all lights flashing simultaneously.	0
6562	There is an easy remedy to this problem that may not be obvious at first.	0
6563	Disconnect the other end of the of power supply from the router and then plug the power supply into the electrical outlet.	0
6564	Allowing the power supply to warm up for as little as few seconds allows the router to boot normally.	1
6565	My suspicion is there might be a current or voltage spike that wreaks havoc on the router	0
6566	"When not in use, I unplug the router along with my cable modem and Vonage terminal adapter to save electricity - especially in the summertime when the waste heat from such devices increases air conditioning load."	0
6567	"While this router only uses 4 watts of electricity, disconnecting communication and computer equipment in the evening can add up to sizeable electrical savings"	1
6568	"If it werent for this startup problem, I would give the Cisco-Linksys WRT160N  five stars."	0
6569	Cisco should have known that such a problem could exist given that consumers are encouraged to minimize vampire electrical loads.	0
6570	"Hopefully, Cisco can get on board and make their products adaptable to such vampire load reduction initiatives."	1
6571	Thanks Amazon for amazing prices!!!	1
